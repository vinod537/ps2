<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Discuss the clinical data supporting the approval of Libtayo in NSCLC and advanced BCC.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ahmet Sezer:<em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>The European Commission (EC) approval of Libtayo gives physicians a valuable new treatment option for patients with first-line locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high PD-L1 expression and no EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 aberrations, and who are not candidates for definitive chemoradiation. The approval is based on data from the global Phase 3 EMPOWER-Lung 1 trial, one of the largest for a PD-1 inhibitor in advanced NSCLC, which investigated Libtayo as monotherapy in comparison with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the trial, Libtayo reduced the risk of death by 32% among all trial patients and 43% in those with proven PD-L1 expression of at least 50%. This was achieved with a greater than 70% crossover rate to Libtayo following disease progression on chemotherapy. Additionally, the trial enrolled patients with a variety of disease characteristics that physicians treat in everyday clinical practice, but which are frequently underrepresented in advanced NSCLC trials. In the trial, 12% of trial patients had pretreated and clinically stable brain metastases and 16% had locally advanced NSCLC and were not candidates for definitive chemoradiation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Safety was assessed in 697 patients, with a duration of exposure of 27 weeks (range: 9 days to 115 weeks) for the Libtayo group and 18 weeks (range: 18 days to 87 weeks) for the chemotherapy group. Serious adverse reactions (AEs) in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia (5% Libtayo, 6% chemotherapy) and pneumonitis (2% Libtayo, 0% chemotherapy). Treatment was permanently discontinued due to AEs in 6% of Libtayo patients; AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation in at least 2 patients were pneumonitis, pneumonia, ischemic stroke, and increased aspartate aminotransferase. No new Libtayo safety signals were observed.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Karl Lewis, M.D., Professor in the Division of Medical Oncology at the University of Colorado</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the European Union, Libtayo is the first immunotherapy indicated for patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma who have progressed on or are intolerant to a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI). The EC approval is based on data from the largest prospective clinical trial in these patients to date. Patients receiving Libtayo who had locally advanced BCC demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 32%, and patients with metastatic BCC demonstrated an ORR of 29%. In addition, approximately 90% of patients across both groups had a duration of response (DOR) of 6 months or longer per Kaplan Meier estimates, and the median DOR had not been reached for either group as of the last data cutoff date.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Safety was assessed in 816 patients across all four Libtayo monotherapy pivotal trials in its approved indications. AEs were serious in 30% of patients and led to permanent discontinuation in 8% of patients. Immune-related adverse reactions occurred in 22% of patients and led to permanent discontinuation in 4% of patients. The most common immune-related adverse reactions were hypothyroidism (8%), hyperthyroidism (3%), pneumonitis (3%), hepatitis (2%), colitis (2%), and immune-related skin adverse reactions (2%).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Discuss the epidemiology of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and its global distribution?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Karl:&nbsp;</strong><em>BCC is the most common type of skin cancer worldwide, representing up to 80% of non-melanoma skin cancers, and the incidence is increasing across many European countries. While the large majority of BCCs are caught early and easily cured with surgery and/or radiation, a small proportion of cases can develop into advanced BCC, which becomes more difficult to treat.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What does these approvals mean to the therapy as well as the companies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Israel:</strong>&nbsp;<em>The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. With these two additional approvals, we are now able to offer a new treatment option for appropriate European patients with advanced NSCLC per the approved indication, and potentially transform treatment for European patients whose advanced BCC has progressed despite HHI treatment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: After NSCLC, BCC and CSCC, is there any other indication in which the company is planning the approval of Libtayo in the EU?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Israel<em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Our Phase 3 trials for Libtayo as monotherapy in second-line cervical cancer and Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC were both stopped early for significant improvements in overall survival. Given these positive results, we are planning regulatory submissions for these clinical settings in the EU and U.S. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you think these approvals strengthen Regeneron and Sanofi’s position in the EU?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Israel:<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Since its initial EC approval, Libtayo has redefined the standard of care for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). Now Libtayo has the opportunity to make a meaningful difference for appropriate patients with advanced NSCLC and advanced BCC, per their approved indications.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are companies’ upcoming plans with regards to Libtayo?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Israel:<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><em>In addition to our planned regulatory submissions, Libtayo is also being investigated in combination with either conventional and/or a variety of novel therapeutic approaches that are planned to target complementary mechanisms of action to PD-1 blockade for many other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: In comparison with established competitors such as Keytruda, Opdivo, Tecentriq, Imfinzi, how does Libtayo distinguish itself in the oncology space?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Israel<em>:  </em></strong><em>Both Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to advancing treatment for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. In the EU, Libtayo is the first PD-1 to be approved as monotherapy for patients with inoperable locally advanced NSCLC who are ineligible for definitive chemoradiation, in addition to metastatic NSCLC. In the EU, Libtayo is also the first immunotherapy indicated for patients with locally advanced or metastatic BCC following HHI therapy, as well as those with locally advanced or metastatic CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Highlights the key features of the NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Falconer:</strong> <em>Abbott’s NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic is a first-of-its-kind technology in the U.S. that allows patients to receive stimulation settings from their physicians in real-time and remotely via the cloud and Bluetooth-based technology. This has the potential to increase access to optimal treatment for patients suffering from chronic pain or movement disorders who don’t live close to a care provider, have difficulty accessing care, or are unable to go to the doctor because of circumstances like COVID-19.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic can also be helpful for people who live in areas — both rural and</em> <em>urban — with inadequate access to medical services. On average people living with movement,</em> <em>disorders will travel over 150 miles to access specialists offering deep brain stimulation (DBS).<a href=""#_edn1""><sup><strong><sup>[i]</sup></strong></sup></a>Without alternative solutions, such as digital and/or telehealth options, these patients are more</em> <em>likely to delay or forego much-needed care.<a href=""#_edn2""><sup><strong><sup>[ii]</sup></strong></sup></a> </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How it is a revolutionizing treatment for patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Falconer:</strong> <em>People living with chronic pain or movement disorders often have a hard time getting to doctor's appointments, especially if they are experiencing a flare in pain or are having trouble managing their Parkinson’s or essential tremor symptoms. With NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, as physicians, we can communicate and digitally prescribe new stimulation settings remotely, allowing them to extend care beyond their clinic walls and optimize therapy management for their patients. In short, we can take the revolution of telehealth in terms of meeting patients anytime and anywhere, and add neuromodulation to the list of what’s possible.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are the neuromodulation technologies on which NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic is compatible?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Falconer:</strong> <em>The NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic is compatible with Abbott's suite of neuromodulation technologies, including Infinity™ DBS System for patients with Parkinson’s disease and tremors of the upper extremities in adults with essential tremors; Proclaim™ XR SCS System for patients living with chronic pain of the trunk and/or limbs; and Proclaim™ DRG Neurostimulation System for patients with chronic pain in the lower limbs caused by complex regional pain syndrome or causalgia.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How does Abbott’s digital efforts make them unique in the pain management/movement disorders industry?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Falconer:</strong> <em>Abbott has always stressed the importance of keeping the patients – and the doctors who treat them – at the center of what they do. Abbott is at the forefront of technological advancements and innovations that are enhancing the patient experience, bringing them the care they want and deserve. This integration of Abbott’s NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic across all Abbott neuromodulation technologies highlights Abbott’s relentless pursuit of patient-centered research and development methodologies that use neuroscience combined with cutting-edge technology to go beyond physical symptom relief to improve the lives of people with neurological disorders.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What kind of role did COVID-19 pandemic play to motivate you to work on Virtual Clinics?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Falconer:</strong> &nbsp;<em>With the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become more difficult for patients to receive the adequate care to treat both long-term and short-term healthcare issues. Even before the pandemic, patients had difficulty reaching their physicians as location and travel was a deterrent for people to receive treatment. Once telemedicine became an option, many clinics saw an uptick on new patients, many of whom had never sought out specialty care because of the barriers of distance, travel and time. NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic brings the convenience and flexibility of telemedicine to neurostimulation therapy, further benefitting chronic pain and movement disorder patients with Abbott devices.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you shed some light on Usher Syndrome Type 2a and Non-Syndromic Retinitis Pigmentosa?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Koenekoop:</strong> <em>Usher syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by both hearing loss up to deafness and the progressive loss of vision. The vision loss can also occur without hearing loss in a related disease called non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (nsRP).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Usher syndrome type 2a is caused most often by mutations in the USH2A gene. This gene is responsible for the formation of the Usherin protein. The mutation results in a dysfunctional Usherin protein and disrupts a process called phototransduction in the light-detecting cells (rod and cone photoreceptors) in the retina, causing RP. People with Usher syndrome type 2a are usually born with hearing loss and start to have progressive vision loss during adolescence.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>People living with RP experience a gradual decline in their vision because both photoreceptor cell types – rods and cones – degenerate and die. Night blindness is followed by visual field loss and visual acuity loss, which may eventually result in complete blindness. RP is one of the most heterogeneous genetic conditions, known to be caused by more than 60 genes, and affects approximately 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 4,000 individuals worldwide.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; &nbsp;Discuss QR-421a in detail (including its RoA, its type, etc), along with&nbsp;its mechanism of action.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Koenekoop:</strong> <em>QR-421a is an investigational RNA therapy developed by ProQR Therapeutics that aims to stop vision loss in people with RP and Usher syndrome due to mutation(s) in a specific part of the USH2A gene, called exon 13, which is one of the most common locations for mutations in the USH2A gene. It is administered as an intravitreal injection (directly into the eye).</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>QR-421a works by binding to the mutated&nbsp;</em><em>USH2A</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>RNA to exclude exon 13 from the RNA. This approach is known as exon skipping. The cells in the retina can then produce a slightly shorter but functional USH2A protein, without the mutation(s).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; &nbsp;Unveil the study design of P-I/II Stellar study.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Koenekoop:</strong> <em>The Stellar trial is a randomized, sham-controlled, single ascending dose, global, multicenter, 24-month study. The study includes a total of 20 patients, of which 14 received a single dose of QR-421a and six received a single sham procedure for masking.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The 14 QR-421a-treated patients enrolled varied in their disease stage and were classified into two groups; advanced patients (defined as patients with baseline visual acuity of &lt;70 letters, or equivalent to LogMAR 0.3, or worse than 20/40 on a Snellen chart) and early to moderate patients (visual acuity of &gt;70 letters, or better than 20/40 Snellen). Six patients had advanced disease and eight patients had early to moderate disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Three different dose levels were studied. The population also varied in disease characteristics with both Usher syndrome (n=7) and nsRP (n=7) and genetic background with both USH2A mutations in exon 13 (n= 9) and other subjects who have one USH2A mutation in exon 13 (n=5) and the other mutation elsewhere in the gene. The majority of the patients were followed for up to 48 weeks, with one patient followed up to 96 weeks.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Koenekoop:</strong> <em>QR-421a was observed to be well tolerated at all doses. There were no serious adverse events reported and no inflammation was observed. One patient had to worsen</em> pre-existing cataracts in both the treated and untreated eyes; both were deemed not treatment-related by the investigator. One patient had a <em>progression of pre-existing cystoid macular edema (CME) that was managed with standard of care. Both cataracts and CME are associated with a high rate of occurrence in the natural history of this disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Best-corrected</em> visual acuity, or BCVA, is a measure of central vision, or sharpness of sight, as measured on an Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter chart. In advanced patients, the primary measure of efficacy is BCVA. In early-moderate patients, the primary measure of efficacy is a <em>measurement of visual fields by static perimetry. QR-421a-treated patients responded on endpoints consistent with their disease stage in both advanced and early to moderate patient populations after a single injection.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>All three doses studied in the Stellar trial were observed to be active as predicted by the preclinical data. No differences were observed based on patients having one or two exons 13 mutations in USH2A, or having Usher syndrome or non-syndromic RP. These findings were consistent with the preclinical data for QR-421a.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; &nbsp;What are your plans to advance QR-421a in other clinical studies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Dr. Koenekoop:</strong> <em>On the basis of these findings, ProQR plans to conduct two pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trials with the Sirius trial evaluating QR-421a in patients with advanced vision loss, and the Celeste trial evaluating QR-421a in patients with early-moderate vision loss. Based on initial Regulatory guidance, ProQR plans to submit protocols to start two Phase 2/3 trials. Each trial could potentially serve as the sole registration trial depending on the findings. Pending finalization of the study designs with Regulatory authorities, the trials are expected to start before year-end 2021. Both trials are expected to be conducted at global centers of excellence.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; &nbsp;How do RNA therapies work specifically in eye disorders?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Koenekoop:</strong> <em>RNA stands for ribonucleic acid and it is an essential component of all living cells. RNA is used for ‘translation’, the process in which proteins are created in a cell. RNA itself is produced from DNA, in a process called ‘transcription’.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>An RNA therapy is designed to correct the mistake, or mutation, in the RNA of someone with a genetic disease. This process is novel and is called genetic editing. By correcting the mistake, the RNA can then be used to create the protein that the cell needs and without the mutation(s), taking away the underlying cause of the disease.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>For a drug to work it first has to get into the body. RNA therapies work best if they are delivered directly to the affected organ. In the case of retinal diseases, RNA therapies can be injected into the vitreous of the eye, which is a cavity filled with a jelly-like fluid. This delivery method is known as an intravitreal injection. Intravitreal injection is one of the most commonly performed procedures for eye diseases. The procedure is performed by eye doctors (Ophthalmologists) for common conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion in adults and in infants with retinopathy of prematurity. Intravitreal delivery is different from sub-retinal injection used for gene therapy which requires complicated retinal surgery and is local.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; &nbsp;QR-421a has the potential to stabilize vision. Justify the statement.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Koenekoop:</strong> <em>Best-corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, is a measure of central vision, or sharpness of sight, as measured on an Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter chart.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the Stellar trial, across all treated patients (n=14), a mean benefit of 6.0 letters was observed at week 48 in the treated eyes compared to the untreated (contralateral) eyes after a single injection.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Among advanced disease patients (n=6), a mean benefit of 9.3 letters was observed at week 48 in the treated eyes as compared to the untreated eyes, and the benefit was maintained for &gt;12 months. All six advanced patients had a benefit in the treatment eye, whereas none of the patients in the sham group had a benefit in the treatment eye. The sham-treated control patients continued to lose their visual acuity.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>These results support the belief that QR-421a has the potential to stabilize vision for patients with Usher syndrome and non-syndromic RP due to USH2A exon 13 mutations.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; &nbsp;What does this drug mean for people living with Usher syndrome and retinitis pigmentosa?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Koenekoop:</strong> <em>QR-421a represents what may be the first approved therapy to stabilize vision for people living with Usher syndrome and non-syndromic RP due to USH2A exon 13 mutations. ProQR looks forward to advancing this drug candidate to pivotal testing to potentially help these patients in dire need.</em></p>

<h5><strong>Answers by Ahmet Sezer, M.D. (Professor in the Department of Medical Oncology at Baskent University in Adana, Turkey)</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the study design and the clinical data supporting the approval of Libtayo.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Sezer: </strong><em>EMPOWER-Lung 1 compared first-line cemiplimab monotherapy versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, with PD-L1 expression of at least 50%. The primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, duration of response, quality of life and safety.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the trial, cemiplimab reduced the risk of death by 32% among all trial patients and 43% in those with proven PD-L1 expression of at least 50%. And this was achieved with a greater than 70% crossover rate to cemiplimab following disease progression on chemotherapy, as well as the largest population of patients with pretreated and stable brain metastases among advanced NSCLC pivotal trials to date.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Given the highly significant improvement in overall survival, the trial was stopped early and all patients were given the option to receive cemiplimab.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Notably, the trial enrolled patients with disease characteristics that physicians treat in everyday clinical practice, but which are frequently underrepresented in advanced NSCLC trials. 12% of trial patients had pretreated and clinically stable brain metastases, and 16% had locally advanced NSCLC that was not a candidate for definitive chemoradiation. This gives us new clinical evidence that could enhance our understanding of how to treat advanced NSCLC.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Sezer: </strong><em>Cemiplimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What does this approval mean to patients, their caregivers, and physicians?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Sezer: </strong><em>While immunotherapies have transformed the treatment of advanced NSCLC in recent years, there is a continuing need for treatment options for patients with high PD-L1 expression.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Libtayo demonstrated an impressive level of efficacy compared to chemotherapy, significantly extending overall survival with a greater than 70% crossover rate to LIBTAYO following disease progression on chemotherapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additionally, Libtayo was approved based on results from a pivotal trial that allowed for certain disease characteristics frequently underrepresented in pivotal advanced NSCLC trials. This gives doctors important new data when considering LIBTAYO for the varied patients and situations they treat in daily clinical practice.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This advanced NSCLC indication is the third U.S. approval for LIBTAYO and follows a Priority Review by the FDA. LIBTAYO has already changed the treatment paradigm for certain patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and is poised to do the same for advanced basal cell carcinoma, or BCC. Now, LIBTAYO has the opportunity to make a meaningful difference for many U.S. patients battling advanced NSCLC.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you put some light on the epidemiology of advanced non-small cell lung cancer?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Sezer: </strong><em>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020, an estimated 225,000 new cases were diagnosed in the U.S. Approximately 84% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, with 75% of these cases diagnosed in advanced stages and an estimated 25% to 30% of cases expected to test positive for PD-L1 in =50% of tumor cells.</em></p>

<h5><strong>Answers by Peter C. Adamson, M.D. (Global Development Head, Oncology and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi)</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: After BCC, CSCC, and NSCLC, what are other indications in which you are evaluating Libtayo?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Adamson:<em> </em></strong><em>Our Libtayo clinical program is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. We expect data from our pivotal trials in advanced cervical cancer and in combination with chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC irrespective of PD-L1 expression later this year, and we are also investigating LIBTAYO in trials in adjuvant and neoadjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and in combination with novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When can we expect EC’s approval of Libtayo and its availability in European countries?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Adamson: </strong><em>The European Medicines Agency is assessing regulatory submissions for Libtayo in advanced NSCLC with =50% PD-L1 expression and locally advanced BCC following treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor. Decisions by the European Commission on these submissions are expected in mid-2021. Libtayo is already approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with advanced CSCC that is locally advanced or metastatic and who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss in detail about Sanofi and Regeneron’s global collaboration on Libtayo.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; What is the role of the therapy in improving the lives of patients with advanced NSCLC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lowy:</strong> <em>PD-1 inhibitors are the standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression and no EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 mutations. The recent FDA approval of Libtayo supports our confidence that it has the opportunity to make a meaningful difference for many U.S. patients battling this difficult-to-treat cancer. The EMPOWER-Lung 1 results provide doctors with important new data to help them determine their best treatment approach for the patients they care for in daily clinical practice.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How Libtayo is different or better from the other treatment options available in the market?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lowy: </strong><em>There is still much we don’t know about advanced NSCLC, and the physicians treating it are a data-driven group who appreciate having multiple therapy options. There are no head-to-head trials of LIBTAYO and other PD-1/L1 inhibitors, so we are unable to make direct comparisons. Based on the efficacy and safety demonstrated in EMPOWER-Lung 1, we believe LIBTAYO offers a valuable treatment option that should be considered for appropriate patients with advanced NSCLC with =50% PD-L1 expression, per our approved indication. Additionally, EMPOWER-Lung 1 could help to address current gaps in knowledge surrounding advanced NSCLC treatment, as it permitted enrollment of patients with disease characteristics who are frequently underrepresented in clinical trials of advanced NSCLC.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How high-income countries are creating a threat to low-income countries’ ability to access future vaccines for COVID-19?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrea</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>The issue is that, because of global manufacturing constraints, every direct deal made by high-income countries takes doses off the future market. This means that very little may be left by the time vaccines actually come to market and that low-income countries, which aren’t able to make advance purchases, may lose out. It may be two or three years before we are able to manufacture enough doses to cover even high priority populations in low-income countries, while high-income countries may get first access to the doses that are produced in the first year or two.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Could you please share in detail about Launch And Scale Speedometer?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrea</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>The Launch and Scale Speedometer project aims to&nbsp;systematically analyze&nbsp;the factors that support or hinder the introduction and scaling of interventions, including but not limited to drugs, diagnostics, and devices, to&nbsp;address critical global health challenges.</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>The primary goals of this project are to:</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>obtain high-quality data on launch and scale-up trends of health interventions globally;</em><em></em></li><li><em>generate and share valuable insights to improve launch and scale pathways; and,</em><em></em></li><li><em>increase collaboration and accountability across the health sector for achieving efficiency and effectiveness for launch and scale so that interventions reach the people who need them more quickly and efficiently.</em><em></em></li></ul>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How Launch and Scale Speedometer help the equitable allocation of COVID-19 vaccines globally?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrea</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>We are mapping the advance purchases made globally to provide transparency and insight into the flow of purchase agreements. Our findings indicate a pattern of purchasing by high-income countries that may undermine the commitment to equity made by these same countries. Equitable allocation appears to be at risk, given the number of doses already reserved before any vaccine candidates are even on the market. Our findings serve as a warning and we hope that our analysis will inform investments in mechanisms that promote equity, such as the Covax Facility, as well as increasing manufacturing capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We will update our advance purchase data every two weeks and continue research into additional areas such as manufacturing capacity, partnerships, and distribution strategies.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:  8.8B Doses are already reserved, even before any candidate in the market. Comment over the statement.</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrea</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>As I noted above, this is an issue in light of the global manufacturing constraints. Despite generous investments in equity through support of the Covax Facility, many high-income countries have also made direct deals to purchase large numbers of vaccine, in some cases enough to cover their populations several times over. This undermines their investment in equity by removing doses from the market before we can ensure that all countries have access to enough to cover the high-priority populations. However, we can mitigate the impact of this somewhat by increasing manufacturing capacity.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we have an insight on the confirmation status of vaccine doses procured by the Country’s income level?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrea</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>What our findings show is that high-income countries have been very successful in purchasing a portfolio of vaccine candidates, increasing the chance that at least one of these investments will come to market. A few middle-income countries have also been successful in making advance purchases, particularly those with manufacturing capacity, such as India and Brazil. We have also seen middle-income countries leveraging participation in clinical trials to secure advance deals for vaccine candidates. However, low-income countries have been left out of this market entirely.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the critical challenges facing by low-income countries like Ethiopia and Peru in the distribution of vaccines?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrea</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>Peru is actually a middle-income country and has been able to secure advance market purchases, in part by leveraging participation in clinical trials. But both middle- and low-income countries will face significant challenges in distribution. These include poor cold-chain infrastructure (particularly an issue for vaccine candidates requiring freezer or supercold storage temperatures), large populations living in remote areas far from healthcare providers, and immunization programs designed to target newborns and children, rather than the elderly. In addition, some countries are facing significant issues with misinformation about COVID-19 that may impact take-up of vaccines.</em><em></em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What you think can help low income &amp; middle-income countries to secure vaccine doses?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrea</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>The Covax Facility is currently the only mechanism we have to bring low-income countries into the market and ensure equitable access to successful vaccines. There are at least two additional strategies, though, that can help to strengthen the positions of low- and middle-income countries. The first is to unlock additional manufacturing capacity in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This is no guarantee but makes it more likely that manufactured doses will stay on the continent. The second strategy is for low- and middle-income countries to pool financing and procurement as a regional block. For example, the African Union and the Africa CDC are developing a “whole-Africa” approach that aims to raise $5 billion to purchase vaccines that can be distributed across African countries. While these countries individually have been unable to compete on the advance purchase market, they will have a stronger position and purchasing power as a block.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Approximately 200 Covid-19 candidates are in development, who you think are leaders in developing vaccines of COVID-19? When can we expect the first vaccine for COVID-19?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrea</strong><strong>:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>It looks likely that the first vaccines will begin to ship out by March of 2021. The vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/Astra Zeneca appear to be closest to receiving regulatory approval. However, the first vaccines to cross the regulatory finish line will not necessarily be the best candidates, particularly for low- and middle-income countries. Several of the leading candidates in terms of timeline are two-dose vaccines that require freezer or ultracold storage, which will be difficult or impossible for many countries to implement, particularly in rural and remote regions. These may be followed closely by one-dose vaccine candidates that only need standard refrigeration or, better yet, a “warm” vaccine, both of which are currently being tested. These vaccine candidates would be much better investments from the perspective of low- and middle-income countries, in terms of being easier to implement and reducing wastage.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:  What are the milestones discovered in the grant of the CHMP’s positive opinion?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lotus: </strong><em>The European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) positive CHMP opinion marks an important step in the European regulatory approval process for baricitinib. If approved, baricitinib could become the first oral JAK inhibitor available to treat adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Due to the high unmet need in treatment options for adult patients with AD, this positive opinion brings us closer to providing treatments to those who need it most.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The positive opinion was based on Lilly’s Phase 3 BREEZE-AD clinical development program for baricitinib evaluating the medicine’s potential to treat AD. The BREEZE-AD clinical development program assessed the efficacy and safety of baricitinib, both as monotherapy (the international BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 studies and BREEZE-AD5 in North America) and in combination with topical corticosteroids (BREEZE-AD4 and BREEZE-AD7), in patients with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. BREEZE-AD4 was conducted in adult patients with moderate to severe AD, with a contraindication, previous failure or intolerance to cyclosporine.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:  Are you planning to target other inflammatory &amp; autoimmune disease apart from RA and AD?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lotus: </strong><em>Yes, Lilly continues to enroll Phase 3 trials for baricitinib for the investigational treatment of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), for which the clinical development program received Fast Track designation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Lilly also has two ongoing Phase 3 trials for baricitinib for the investigational treatment of alopecia areata (AA), and the clinical development program received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA earlier this year.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Also for your awareness, baricitinib is being studied for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in two Phase 3 trials. Lilly entered into an agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to study baricitinib in NIAID’s Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial. In addition, Lilly initiated its own Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in hospitalized adults with COVID-19.</em></p>

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>If approved, Baricitinib could become the first oral JAK inhibitor available to treat adult patients living with moderate to severe AD in Europe. </p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:  As Baricitinib (OLUMIANT) is approved in 70+ countries for RA. How many other geographies are in focus for AD except EU?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lotus: </strong><em>We look forward to working with other regulatory authorities to bring a much-needed treatment option to market for adults living with this disease</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:  How the approval in the EU for AD helps you to build the momentum in this indication?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lotus: </strong><em>We are thrilled with the EMA’s positive CHMP opinion. The agency’s opinion marks an important step in the European regulatory approval process for baricitinib. If approved, baricitinib could become the first oral JAK inhibitor available to treat adult patients living with moderate to severe AD in Europe</em>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:  Notably, Sanofi’s Dupixent and Pfizer’s Eucrisa is already approved in AD. What are the other potential threats to Baricitinib in AD and how it is superior to others?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lotus:</strong> <em>Since there are currently no head-to-head studies comparing baricitinib with other systemic treatment options, we can only discuss the findings of our own clinical trials and are not in the position to directly compare and discuss the efficacy and safety of baricitinib with that of other companies’ products. We recommend caution against indirect comparisons of systemic treatment approved or in development for AD due to the considerable limitations related to study designs, patient characteristics, scales for skin involvement, and assessments and efficacy assessments. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Baricitinib could be the first oral JAK inhibitor and the first approved oral systemic treatment available for AD in more than 20 years.  Baricitinib may be an important additional offering for those not ready to take an injectable biologic. We expect dermatologists will use both oral and injectable agents to treat AD, similar to what occurs when treating psoriasis.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba:  Discuss Eli Lilly’s working in digital space in enhancing the QoL of patients with Inflammatory Skin Disease</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lotus:  </strong><em>Lilly, we believe today’s most advanced digital technologies can lead to personalized and actionable insights, new channels of engagement between patients and their health care providers (HCPs), and improved self-management solutions for patients – all of which can contribute to better health.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:  Is there any specific digital tool (sensors, wearables, app) you are working on for AD and other indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lotus:</strong> <em>We are investigating several different approaches to enhance not only patient care, but also how we recruit, enroll, and conduct clinical research. These include the use of wearable sensors to collect biometric data and help us understand how patients respond to medications; leveraging artificial intelligence to better diagnose certain GI issues; and, determining how disease management tools can help provide a better understanding of one’s condition, which could lead to better discussions with their healthcare professional.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How was your virtual experience at UEG week? Can we have a quick highlight on the data of mirikizumab presented at UEG Week?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lotus:</strong> <em>I was very pleased with my experience at UEG Week; although the format was different than previous years considering the meeting was entirely virtual, it was a great opportunity to learn about the latest innovation in the gastroenterology space. Lilly had the opportunity to present new efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 SERENITY study evaluating mirikizumab in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease at this year’s virtual UEG Week. These are the first 52-week data for mirikizumab in Crohn’s disease (CD) and the results continue to build upon the data already presented in ulcerative colitis (UC). These results are an important part of the clinical development program for mirikizumab, and Lilly hopes these data can provide optimism for those living with Crohn’s disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>At 52 weeks, patients who showed endoscopic improvement at 12 weeks and continued treatment with mirikizumab achieved the following results:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong><em>Endoscopic response:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Nearly 60% of patients achieved endoscopic response (58.5% in the randomized IV dosing group and 58.7% in the SC group).</em></li><li><strong><em>Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) remission:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;More than 45% of patients achieved PRO remission (46.3% in the IV group and 45.6% in the SC group).</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Among the subset of patients who achieved an endoscopic response at Week 12, 69.6% and 66.7% in the IV (n=23) and SC (n=24) groups, respectively, also had endoscopic response at Week 52. Additionally, among those with endoscopic remission at Week 12, 50.0% and 64.3% in the IV (n=6) and SC (n=14) groups, respectively, also had endoscopic remission at Week 52. These Phase 2 data support and reinforce the potential for mirikizumab in the ongoing, pivotal VIVID Phase 3 program as a potential treatment for patients with Crohn’s disease.</em></strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the other treatments across Lilly’s immunology portfolio for transforming the treatment experience of patients with autoimmune diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lotus:</strong> <em>We recognize there are still significant unmet needs, as well as personal and societal costs, for people living with autoimmune diseases and our goal is to minimize the burden of disease and help patients find treatments that offer meaningful improvements. Our immunology portfolio includes first in class or first in disease molecules and we’re investing in leading-edge clinical approaches across our deep pipeline, which also includes early candidates currently in Phase 1 and Phase 2 development.

<p><strong>Tuba: As the market is flooded with multiple biologics in IBD, what is Lilly’s strategy to position its therapy in CD?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lotus:</strong> <em>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which included Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, affects more than 10 million people worldwide. Crohn’s disease is a serious and difficult-to-treat condition, and there is a significant need for additional treatments that can address the challenging and painful symptoms of people living with Crohn’s disease experience. In the study presented at UEG Week, patients treated with mirikizumab showed a response in both symptom relief and endoscopic response and remission at 52 weeks. Based on these Phase 2 data, we’re optimistic Lilly is one step closer to providing relief for patients.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss your collaboration with leading diabetes technology companies in detail.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong><em> We’re collaborating with leading diabetes technology companies – Dexcom, Glooko, myDiabby Healthcare, and Roche – in markets outside of the U.S. to integrate our connected insulin pen solutions with their software to provide automated data collection for insulin dose tracking. The unique management platforms from each company will be compatible with Lilly’s Tempo Pen™ and Tempo Smart Button (currently under development and pending CE mark). When the Tempo Smart Button is attached to the pen and paired with a compatible app, the Bluetooth-enabled Smart Button automatically transfers data to the app.<br><br></em><strong>Tuba: What is unique about this collaboration and what motivates Lilly to ally with big technological parties? Can we expect more collaboration from Lilly in the field of diabetes?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong><em> This collaboration is unique because it offers compatibility with existing solutions – making it easier for people with diabetes using these platforms to benefit from a tool like a connected insulin pen. We believe that Dexcom, Glooko, myDiabby Healthcare, and Roche are important leaders in diabetes software and offer some of the most commonly used platforms in markets outside the U.S., which will allow us to more effectively meet people with diabetes where they are in their treatment journey versus requiring them to completely shift their management plan.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As part of our mission to simplify diabetes management for those living with the condition, we regularly evaluate opportunities for collaborations with other technology companies in the diabetes space to deliver the best solutions possible. We’re excited about our recent partnerships (including Welldoc) as well as Ypsomed to commercialize an AID system in the U.S. and look forward to expanding our offerings in the connected care space.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Lilly has few collaborations in diabetes such as Welldoc early this year. What is the difference between Welldoc and this collaboration or any other collaboration?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong><em> We are focusing our immediate efforts with Welldoc on developing a connected pen platform for people living with diabetes in the U.S., which includes commercializing a new version of its BlueStar app. The agreement with Welldoc is global and we will work with them to evaluate potential opportunities to launch the platform in other geographies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>While the agreement with Dexcom, Glooko, myDiabby Healthcare, and Roche is also global, it involves integrating the Tempo Pen and Tempo Smart Button into their respective product offerings in markets outside the United States.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does this collaboration help patients with diabetes?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kevin</strong><strong>:</strong><em> This collaboration is an important step forward in helping people reduce the amount of “mental math” they have to complete every day to understand how their glucose levels are impacted by a variety of factors, including their insulin doses. Insulin dose logging is often a missing piece of the diabetes management puzzle for people who use insulin pens and manually track their doses. By integrating data from the connected pen solutions (automatically captured by the Tempo Pen and Tempo Smart Button) into compatible software, users and HCPs can get a fuller picture of a person’s diabetes management while relieving some of the burden associated with manual logging. This accurate, real-time data collection may help support improved decision-making for people with diabetes and their healthcare providers.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Give specifications of Tempo Pen and Tempo Smart Button.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kevin</strong><strong>:</strong><em> At this time, the Tempo Smart Button and compatibility efforts are still in development, so we cannot share in-depth details about functionality, but can provide background on how the products work together.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Tempo Pen is a modified version of Lilly’s existing prefilled, disposable insulin pen to which the Tempo Smart Button (which is pending CE mark), attaches. When the Tempo Smart Button is attached to the Tempo Pen and paired with a compatible app, the Bluetooth-enabled Smart Button automatically transfers data to the app. We aim to support improved decision-making for people with diabetes and their healthcare providers through accurate, real-time data collection.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What would be the targeted markets to launch Tempo Pen and Tempo Smart Button?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kevin</strong><strong>:</strong><em> The Tempo Pen is approved in several markets around the world, including in the U.S. and the European Union. We plan to launch the Tempo Pen alongside the Tempo Smart Button, pending local regulatory clearance or certification for the module. We expect to receive CE mark certification by year-end 2021 for the Smart Button and launch rollout will vary by region.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why do you think digital efforts in diabetes are essential?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kevin</strong><strong>:</strong><em> Managing diabetes is a complicated process, especially insulin management. We know the complexity of managing insulin, especially challenges associated with manually tracking doses, may lead to undesirable outcomes if miscalculations happen. As part of our commitment to simplifying the lives of those living with diabetes, investing in the development of connected care technologies – including collaborations with valuable partners who offer unique capabilities – is a critical piece of our business.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are very excited about the potential of our ongoing connected care efforts from partnership agreements related to our insulin pens as well as our efforts with Ypsomed to commercialize an automated insulin delivery system.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Share your long-term goals for improving the lives of people with diabetes. What are Lilly’s other efforts to make life better for people with diabetes?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong><em> Addressing the impact of diabetes has been at the heart of our purpose for a century and our long-term goal is to improve the outcomes of those living with the condition by simplifying the management process through the </em>use of technology to enhance their overall experience. There are several avenues we pursue to achieve that goal through innovative medicine development as well as the <em>advancement of technologies for delivering that medicine and monitoring its impact on blood glucose levels. Our endeavors include varying tools from connected pens and data management app compatibility, to a fully integrated automated insulin delivery system. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are making strong progress in our collaboration with Ypsomed to advance our automated insulin delivery system and we look forward to sharing more updates on that work in the future. </em><em>Holistically, we continually engage with the diabetes community to understand unmet needs and are dedicated to progressing research on treatments and tools that can meet these needs. Looking to the future, we’ll remain strong in our commitment to push the boundaries of what’s possible in diabetes care</em><em>.</em></p>

55541,PharmaShots Interview: Enosi LifeSciences' Dr. H. Michael Shepard Shares Insights on TNF-Inhibiting Molecules,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a recent interview with PharmaShots,<strong> Dr. H. Michael Shepard CEO and Co-Founder of Enosi </strong>shared<strong> </strong>his views on the announcement that Enosi Life Sciences has filed a patent for three of its TNF-inhibiting molecules: EN1001 for autoimmune disease, along with EN2001 and EN3001 for autoimmune disease and cancer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Enosi will offer use in multiple diseases and continue to address the market need for TNF-inhibitor therapeutics. <strong>EN1001:</strong> An enhancement to existing TNF-blocking technologies, this molecule only blocks Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-1 (TNFR1), instead of both TNFR1 and TNFR2</li><li><strong>EN2001:</strong> A growth factor trap that offers a completely different option for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which can be combined with other RA therapeutics without fear of increasing immunosuppression</li><li><strong>EN3001:</strong> A molecule that will counter activation of TNFR2 as a bad actor in cancer and fibrotic diseases, offering a checkpoint inhibitor by increasing immunity</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What inspired you to form the new company focusing on autoimmune diseases and cancer?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael: </strong><em>My colleague Sir Marc Feldmann and I have both spent over 20+ years developing therapeutics, earning accolades such as the Laskar award within our respective fields of autoimmune disease and cancer. We came to the realization that there are certain commonalities between the two and an opportunity to address both through more precise targeting of inflammation and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors. The therapeutic candidates we’re exploring would have the ability to be useful for a combination of multiple disorders, which increases their value and lowers the probability of failure. Our goal is to create more effective therapeutic solutions that offer lower toxicity, improved patient outcomes, and profitability for investors.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How did the past experience of the co-founders aid in forming the company that brings two fields together?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael: </strong><em>Autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and cancer have many properties in common. These include inflammation, abnormal cell growth, and many of the same disease-associated immune cells. The obvious clinical similarity is that chemotherapy is used to treat both diseases. Shepard and Feldmann believe that by combining their knowledge in these two areas Enosi will discover new ways to treat each disease and some therapies that will be useful for both diseases. Since new drugs costs at least $150M to be developed and approved, this would represent an enormous saving to the healthcare system. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Evidence that this approach might work is that Shepard has discovered therapies that are successful at blocking tumor growth in mice. In collaboration, he worked with Feldmann, and together they showed that the new molecule, called a growth factor trap, also worked in mouse models of RA. Further work showed that it worked because many of the same growth factors at work in cancer are the same as those at work in autoimmune disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Would you like to talk a little more about seed funding?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael: </strong><em>Venture Capital firms who put money into start-up companies gain a big benefit once the company has proven that its technology has a good chance to be successful in the clinic. This part of the drug discovery process does not take many millions of dollars. Enosi has decided to pursue seed funding from individual investors who will then benefit from this ‘bump’ in valuation. Enosi will subsequently be able to obtain much better terms when seeking funding from other sources. The initial investors will retain more ownership and benefit more from the increasing value of the company. This is not the usual way biotech companies are started. Enosi is a pioneer in the public funding of biotechnology.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we have a glimpse of Enosi’s pipeline of products? </strong><strong><s></s></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael: </strong><em>It is very important for start-up biotech companies to focus on proving that they can be successful in creating their first product. However, the long-term health of the company requires long term planning where the goals are aligned with the know-how and resources of the company.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Enosi is focused on the EN1001 project.  EN1001 is a new kind of TNF Blocker (blocks induction of the inflammation of RA which is induced by the hormone called TNF). Current TNF Blockers are not prescribed for early disease, and often not for older patients, because of their side effects. The most important and frequent of these is an infection by tuberculosis, Listeria, Legionella, and Salmonella. Cancer in children and adults, and cardiovascular events (stroke) are also listed as important safety threats in the FDA ‘black box’ warning that is in every package of TNF Blocker (examples are Humira, Enbrel, Remicade). Nonetheless, medicines that block TNF are worth in the range of $40-50B per year. The biggest selling drug class in history. Enosi has discovered EN1001 Blocker to accomplish therapy of autoimmune disease. The company believes EN1001 will not have these side effects. It may then be given earlier in therapy, and thus could be curative, and it will be safer for children and older people.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>There is another dimension to TNFR1. Recent science has indicated that persistent inflammation, caused in many cases by TNF and TNFR1, is associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s’ disease. This link has been proven in animal models, and in surveys of autoimmune disease patients treated with TNF Blockers, or not. It is unlikely that the current generation of TNF Blockers could be used for this purpose because of the side effects. However, EN1001 could potentially be used.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How are these molecules different from the available TNF blockers and JAK inhibitors?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael: </strong><em>The current approved ‘biologic’ drugs to treat RA (Humira, Enbrel, Remicade) all are based upon TNF, either directly or indirectly. The TNF Blockers all ‘trap’ TNF and prevent it from activating inflammation. Unfortunately, these current drugs inhibit both of the routes that TNF influences the cell. The first route is called TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). Stimulating TNFR1 causes inflammation. But there is a second receptor, called TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). This second receptor is naturally supposed to turn down TNFR1. Unfortunately, the current TNF Blockers inhibit both receptors: TNFR1, the inflammatory or ‘bad’ receptor, and TNFR2, the anti-inflammatory or ‘good’ receptor. Blockage of TNFR2 also causes increased susceptibility to infection. Enosi’s drug (EN1001) only blocks TNFR1 and leaves the anti-inflammatory TNFR2 alone.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>When TNF activates TNFR1 it also activates many other inflammatory signals inside the cell, including JAK. Thus, inhibiting JAK cannot block all the different signals induced by TNFR1. This means that blocking JAK will only partially treat TNF-associated disease. Unfortunately, despite the fact that inhibiting JAK does work to slow down arthritis, it also has the same black box warnings as the TNF Blockers</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we expect more programs from Enosi LifeScience?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael: </strong><em>Enosi also has three other programs that are all patented and could be useful in both cancer and autoimmune disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Will Enosi develop these molecules on their own or look for a collaboration to develop them?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael: </strong><em>Enosi plans to take their molecules from discovery through early clinical trials to show that they work in patients. We will collaborate with academic institutions to help keep costs down, and we will collaborate with other biotech and pharma companies to help fund our projects.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are your expectations with the patented programs? How will it help in the growth of the company?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael: </strong><em>Enosi’s intellectual property protects all of our programs and is meant to keep other companies from copying what we have done. We will always be willing to discuss a collaboration with another company if it increases the value to our shareholders.</em></p>

60213,PharmaShots Interview: Entrada's Dipal Doshi Shares Insights on the Series B Funding Utilize to Advance DMD Program into the Clinic,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Dipal Doshi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Entrada Therapeutics </strong>share his views on $116M Series B financing and what does this milestone means for the company’s pipeline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The Series B financing was led by Wellington Management Company, who was joined by Redmile Group, TCG Crossover, Greenspring Associates, Point72, Qatar Investment Authority, Moore Strategic Ventures, Goldman Sachs, CureDuchenne Ventures and one undisclosed global investment firm</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The funding will be used to advance the research, expansion, and clinical progress of Entrada’s diverse pipeline, which currently includes several oligonucleotide programs in the neuromuscular space</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Entrada’s latest raise will also go towards exploring oligonucleotide opportunities beyond muscle, and intracellular protein degradation leads in oncology and beyond</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the Series B funding. What does it mean to the company?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dipal:</strong><em> This financing provides Entrada the capital needed to achieve several value-creating milestones, and this includes bringing our growing pipeline into clinical development.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the various investors involved in the funding?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dipal:</strong><em> &nbsp;The Series B financing was led by Wellington Management Company, who was joined by Redmile Group, TCG Crossover, Greenspring Associates, Point72, Qatar Investment Authority (“QIA”), Moore Strategic Ventures, Goldman Sachs, CureDuchenne Ventures and one undisclosed global investment firm.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Existing investors 5AM Ventures, MPM Capital, Roche Venture Fund, MRL Ventures Fund and Agent Capital also participated in the financing.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To date, we have raised ~ $200M ($84M in Series A and $116M in Series B)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; What is Entrada’s plan to utilize the funding?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dipal:</strong><em> &nbsp;Entrada plans to use the investment proceeds to advance our diverse pipeline towards the clinic. Included in this pipeline are several of Entrada’s oligonucleotide programs for the treatment of multiple neuromuscular diseases, led by Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In addition, the funds will allow us to expand beyond neuromuscular diseases into additional therapeutic areas and advance a growing pipeline of intracellular antibody and enzyme-based therapeutics.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we have a glance at your pipeline of oligonucleotide therapies to treat neuromuscular diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dipal:</strong><em> &nbsp;As noted, our oligonucleotide programs are led by DMD – ~40% of patients with DMD have mutations amenable to exon skipping of exons 44, 45, 51, and 53. The Muscular Dystrophy Association cites a prevalence rate of 6 per 100,000 in the U.S. and Europe, although a recent meta-analysis published in 2020 updated that number to 7.1 per 100,000. That said most estimates of DMD are 10,000 to 15,000 in the US with a similar number in Europe. As such the 4 exons would account for 8,000 – 12,000 patients across the two regions. We are projecting a first in-human trial in 2022 for our lead program, with additional candidates following close behind. We believe the outcome in one DMD exon skipping program will be predictive of the outcomes for patients with other exon-skipping amenable mutations.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;When can we expect the first molecule to enter clinical studies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dipal:</strong><em> &nbsp;This year we are focusing on selecting a candidate and generating data which will ultimately lay the foundation for our IND filing, with a goal of initiating our first in human trials in 2022. Assuming everything goes as planned, we should have human data in 2023.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are the company’s different platforms? Can you briefly explain each of them?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":60217,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EEV-1024x537.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-60217""/><figcaption><strong>Source: Entrada</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dipal:</strong><em> &nbsp;Using our proprietary Endosomal Escape Vehicle (EEV™) platform (demonstrated above), we are developing intracellular biologics with the potential to fundamentally improve the standard of care across a wide range of diseases.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The EEVs themselves are cyclic peptides – very small rings of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) designed to ensure that they stay stable in the bloodstream. The EEVs:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>bind to the surface of any cell;</em></li><li><em>are taken up by the cells through a process call endocytosis (where the EEV and conjugate</em></li><li><em>are engulfed by the cell) and;</em></li><li><em>induce the resulting endosome (a naturally occurring lipid package ferrying the EEV-conjugate into the cell) to release the contents inside the cell</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The EEVs are chemically linked to any biological</em> of our choosing. For instance, in the case of our neuromuscular programs, we chemically link them to small strands of nucleic acids called oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids are the “letters” which in certain sequences provide the coding instructions of life. In this case,<em> we target RNA, the code of which is read by intracellular structures which then produce proteins. In our lead programs, patients have mutations that prevent the translation of RNA into proteins. By forcing the cell to “skip” these mutant segments of code, the cell is able to continue the process of protein generation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>On the other hand, in the case of our enzyme/protein related programs, the EEV is linked to an enzyme (which is a protein that interacts with another protein in the cell, the product of which then goes on to generate yet another step in the chain... like a circle of cascading dominos that constantly resets) critical to maintaining a specific step in a cell’s metabolic processes. Patients lacking an enzyme will fail to produce needed products to maintain the viability of the cell (or other cells in the body) and may also see the buildup of toxic byproducts. Either of which can result in the symptoms of disease and sometimes death.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Finally, in the case of our EEV-linked antibody and peptide programs, the antibody or peptide is designed to capture both a mutant protein within the cell that causes disease (such as the uncontrolled replication associated with cancer) and also a protein within the cell that marks the resulting complex of EEV-antibody-mutant protein for destruction</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What is Entrada’s strategy to deal with devastating diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dipal:</strong><em> &nbsp;We define devastating disease as any condition where there are no adequate treatments. As such, we do not intend to limit our portfolio only to rare diseases. In addition, to DMD, we are exploring oligonucleotide opportunities beyond muscle, intracellular protein degradation leads in oncology and beyond, and believe that our antibody and peptide programs can address the need in a wide range of areas.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you looking for investment to advance your preclinical programs into clinical? If yes, how can one contact you?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dipal:</strong><em> &nbsp;The company is well position to achieve our strategic goals in the near future.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you planning to do collaborations this year or in the coming years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dipal:</strong><em> &nbsp;Our end goal is always to do what’s best for the patient. To most efficiently advance programs to patients, this could mean partnerships or collaborations with other industry or academic leaders. Should we decide to leverage external collaborators, we would do so in a way that preserves flexibility around our business model and future decision-making.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Why do you think intracellular biologics have the potential to target distressing diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dipal:</strong><em> &nbsp;First, it’s important to understand the potential of intracellular biologics, which when designed and delivered efficiently, target and engage the underlying drivers of disease. It’s estimated that 75-80% of disease targets are inside the cell and therefore difficult to the drug, or otherwise considered undruggable. Many proteins, peptides, and oligonucleotides have highly potent and specific biological activities but are unable to penetrate the cell membrane efficiently, leading to only a small portion of the intended drug reaching the intracellular targets.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We believe our EEVs are the ideal backbone for developing biologics in a wide range of extra-hepatic focused diseases. Entrada has demonstrated intracellular uptake of unique biologics ranging from oligonucleotides to antibodies, to larger multimeric proteins. The versatility of our EEV platform offers broad therapeutic potential as we can enable the development of intracellular biologics to inhibit, degrade, edit or replace an intracellular target – whichever is best suited to correct the underlying disease pathology.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tej: </strong><em>The key features are its automated direct patient sample-to-answer workflow without the need for RNA extraction. It requires less than 2-3 minutes of </em>hands-on time and provides lab-quality<em> RT-PCR test results within an hour.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What platforms, technologies, and workflows do we need to be prepared for the next pandemic?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tej: </strong><em>We will need a combination of vital sign measurement systems for population-wide screening while respecting privacy protection as well as widely distributed, decentralized health testing infrastructures in retail clinics.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Why would one prefer Fluxergy’s test over the other PCR test present in the market for COVID-19?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tej: </strong><em>The market has been flooded during the pandemic with PCR POC systems that perform great PCR but that’s the only thing they can do. That means we are expecting a large fleet of underutilized POC equipment after COVID-19 is over. Our platform is based on a multimodal technology capable of performing PCR, immunoassays, potentiometry, and imaging cytometry with the same instrument. Hence, today’s Fluxergy's users of the COVID-19 RT-PCR test will be able to use the very same analyzer also for immunoassays and other types of testing as we will be expanding our product portfolio.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Why do you consider Fluxergy’s analyzer ideal for all areas of diagnostic testing?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tej: </strong><em>Fluxergy’s workflows are sample-to-answer formats independently of the type of testing. The main differences for each type of test will be the sample type and volume as well as the FluxergyCard. This will allow provider sites to establish a homogenous fleet of instruments with standardized and simplified training of lab technicians.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can you put some light on the future of multimodal technology?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tej: </strong><em>The future of the technology will be driven by the clinical needs for specific multimodal test panels as well as to some extent reimbursement conditions. We are currently exploring with clinicians in the US, EU, and the Asia Pacific the unmet clinical needs for better in vitro diagnostics and how to configure corresponding multimodal test panels.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are the different challenges and opportunities in POC testing?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tej: </strong><em>The main challenges are the test panel configuration and market development. Providers need to be informed and incentivized to use (more) POC testing solutions. The opportunities are tremendous volume uplift potentials as soon as POC makes it systematically into doctor’s offices and retail clinics. It is important not to see POC as a competitor to Central Labs – POC solutions are convenient tools to expand the reach of Central Labs. The Central Labs will always remain, the POC testing will add to</em> the testing volumes. The biggest opportunity is to perform testing on a level that can help to prevent<em> or reducing hospitalizations and help faster recovery.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you open to collaborations to expand the reach of your products?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tej: </strong><em>Yes, we are open for collaborations and are also in discussions with strategic partners.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How will decentralized POC testing become a key enabler for telemedicine</strong>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tej: </strong><em>POC testing will help to make telemedicine better actionable and provide providers real-time data for remote decision-making.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tej: &nbsp;</strong><em>We started in 2013 and mastered since then successfully challenges in technology and manufacturing. In 2020 we have doubled our employee headcount – by end of 2021, we are expecting to have about 100 employees at our Irvine HQ. At present we are driving our geo-expansion with GTM partners in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We will be keeping the COVID-19 products in our portfolio and add a combined RT-PCR/Antibody test for COVID-19 as well as a multiplex respiratory RT-PCR panel (COVID-19, Influenza A/B, RSV) for the upcoming fall. Beyond that, we are developing tests addressing kidney health and chronic inflammation. – In addition, we are also pursuing parallel business opportunities in the equine health and food safety testing market – as the need for POC is beyond human healthcare markets.</em></p>

<p><strong>Q12.&nbsp;<em>For a total novice, please explain the Fluxergy Analyzer and the work Fluxergy does.</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tej: </strong><em>The Fluxergy analyzer is a compact, high-density integration of standard lab testing technologies in a box as small as a coffee machine. It incorporates components such as a fluorescence detector and thermal control element for PCR, a colorimetric unit for detecting immunoassays, a potentiometer for testing small molecules, and an imaging cytometer enabled with proprietary optics and an evolving AI engine for cell counting applications. We are aiming to be capable of clinical-grade Complete Blood Count (CBC) at the point-of-care within the next 2-3 years, which is the “Holy Grail” of point-of-care testing. The Fluxergy Analyzer – together with the single-use consumables FluxergyCards, has the potential to make various types of health testing accessible and available at decentralized locations such as physician offices, urgent care clinics, and retail clinics. We are working hard on this vision and currently identifying the right strategic and GTM-partners to prepare the market.</em></p>

<ul><li><em>We developed our proprietary Fast-Clear linker technology to enable the delivery of isotopes to tumor cells while simultaneously promoting enhanced clearance of the non-tumor localized radiation.</em></li><li><em>Fast-Clear linker differs significantly from standard commercial linkers. When our targeted alpha therapies (TATs) are metabolized outside of cancer cells, the Fast-Clear linker technology is designed to rapidly clear from the body along with any isotopes bound to the linker.</em></li><li><em>Based on an immune response we saw in preclinical studies, we believe that the combination of our TATs with checkpoint inhibitors may lead to a robust therapeutic effect in solid tumors compared to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapies.</em></li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why does Fusion think radiopharmaceuticals are a promising area of exploration in oncology?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>External beam radiation has been a mainstay of cancer therapy for decades. Radiopharmaceuticals take it to the next level by precisely delivering radiation to cancer cells. Fusion focuses on alpha-emitting radiopharmaceuticals, which cause substantial physical damage to cancer cells, including multiple double-stranded DNA breaks that are lethal to the tumor. Despite their lethal nature, alpha radiation also travels only 1-3 cells in distance. When combined with a targeting molecule like an antibody, it is like a “smart bomb” for cancer cells.</em></li><li>Alpha radiation is extremely hard to resist, unlike many conventional therapies, and it kills cancer cells through multiple<em> mechanisms of action which may give them the ability to treat hard-to-treat solid tumors and the potential to work synergistically with other approved oncology therapies. In addition to the primary MOA of <sup>225</sup>Ac which is direct cell damage through the induction of multiple double-stranded DNA breaks, additional mechanisms, such as the “bystander effect” (in which nearby tumor cells are also killed) likely expands the effective direct cell kill range of the alpha particles. We’ve also observed a third potential MOA in preclinical studies, the release of tumor-associated antigens and concomitant maturation of antigen-presenting cells and proliferated T cells at tumor sites, leading to an enhanced immune response to go along with the physical damage by the alpha radiation.</em></li></ul>

<ul><li><em>Our plan is to develop our lead asset FPI-1434, currently in s Phase 1 trial, first as a monotherapy treatment and then to pursue combination approaches. Initial approval in monotherapy may be in a relapsed/refractory patient population.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Based on an immune response we saw in preclinical studies, we believe that the combination of our TATs with checkpoint inhibitors may lead to a robust therapeutic effect in solid tumors compared to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapies.</em></li><li><em>We are also exploring the potential of combining FPI-1434 with DNA damage response inhibitors, or DDRis. In our preclinical studies, we have seen a strong synergistic effect by combining FPI-1434 with approved PARP inhibitors.</em></li><li><em>We believe that the synergies we have observed could expand the addressable patient populations for our assets and allow for potential use in earlier lines of treatment if approved.</em></li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; What is colorectal cancer? Where does it start?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong><em> Most colorectal cancers (CRC) start as a growth, known as a polyp, on the inner lining of the colon or the rectum. These cancers can also be called colon cancer or rectal cancer, depending on where they start but are often grouped together because they have many features in common.<sup>1 </sup>According to the <a href=""https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"">American Cancer Society</a>, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed among both men and women in the U.S.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>There are different types of polyps, each with a different risk of colorectal cancer. If not detected early, certain types of polyps can become cancerous over time. For example, hyperplastic polyps and inflammatory polyps are more common but generally are not pre-cancerous. Adenomatous polyps (adenomas) have a higher risk of developing into cancer. Sessile serrated polyps (SSP) and traditional serrated adenomas (TSA) have a higher risk of colorectal cancer and are often treated like adenomas.<sup>2</sup> Other factors, aside from the type of polyp, can signal if there may be an increased risk in developing colorectal cancer. This includes if a polyp larger than one centimeter is found, if more than three polyps are found, or if dysplasia is seen in the polyp after it has been removed. Screening for colorectal cancer is important to monitor the development of polyps and other risk factors associated with the development of colorectal cancer. For more details on the types of polyps and conditions that can lead to colorectal cancer, see the American Cancer Society: <a href=""https://www.cancer.org/treatment/understanding-your-diagnosis/tests/understanding-your-pathology-report/colon-pathology/colon-polyps-sessile-or-traditional-serrated-adenomas.html"">Understanding Your Pathology Report: Colon Polyps</a>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Why is there a need to raise awareness on the need for complete biomarker testing for patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong><em> Unfortunately, many patients with metastatic or advanced colorectal cancer may not be receiving the most appropriate therapy due to the absence of complete biomarker testing before starting first-line treatment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Over the last decade, the <a href=""https://www.nccn.org/patients/guidelines/content/PDF/colon-patient.pdf"">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a> has expanded guidelines to recommend all patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receive testing for six genomic alterations or biomarkers including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, ERBB2 (HER2), and NTRK as well as microsatellite instability (MSI) to help inform first-line treatment decisions.<sup>3,4</sup> Yet, even with these expanded guidelines, only 40% of patients with advanced CRC receive the recommended biomarker testing, putting the majority of these patients at risk for receiving inappropriate treatment.<sup>5</sup> In a recent <a href=""https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.19.00274"">report</a> published in JCO Precision Oncology, 72% of patients who were given an anti-EGFR therapy did not have guideline-aligned testing for RAS and BRAF biomarkers to determine if they were eligible for that treatment. When the right therapy is matched to the patient’s genomic profile, it can significantly improve survival for patients with advanced CRC.<sup>6</sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; What are the different advocacy groups that collaborated with Guardant Health for the Clear Your View campaign?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong><em> In addition to the Global Colon Cancer Association, where I work as an Executive Director, Guardant Health has partnered with the Colorectal Cancer Alliance, Fight CRC, KRAS Kickers, and PALTOWN to raise awareness of the important role complete biomarker testing play in guiding initial treatment decisions for newly diagnosed patients with advanced CRC.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; What is the Clear Your View campaign? What is the focus behind the campaign?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong><em> The Clear Your View campaign is an awareness initiative sponsored by Guardant Health to raise awareness of the importance of complete biomarker testing before starting first-line treatment for all advanced cancer patients, with a focus on colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Now in its second year, the campaign urges oncologists to “stop, wait, and treat” for every advanced NSCLC or CRC patient. Oncologists should STOP and order all guideline-recommended biomarker tests and WAIT to get complete test results before determining the most appropriate therapy. They should TREAT these patients by choosing the right therapy with confidence.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; What are the different biomarkers that need to be tested before initiating the treatment for CRC?</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong><em> It is currently recommended that patients with advanced colorectal cancer be tested for six genomic alterations or biomarkers including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, ERBB2 (HER2), and NTRK as well as microsatellite instability (MSI).<sup>3,4 </sup>It is important to note, however, that medical guidelines continue to update and expand their recommendations, so this list may expand in the foreseeable future.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; What are the drawbacks of incomplete biomarker testing?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong><em> Unfortunately, current rates of biomarker testing in advanced NSCLC and CRC fail to meet recommended medical guidelines.<sup>5,7,8,9</sup> When there is incomplete biomarker testing before starting treatment, this can lead to inappropriate treatment selection and patients may not receive potentially life-changing precision medicines. Instead, patients may be prescribed chemotherapy or immunotherapy, which may not be as effective as a precision medicine targeting a biomarker. Testing for all guideline-recommended biomarkers can help predict which patients are most likely to respond to a certain treatment and which will not respond and is one of the best ways to ensure that the patient receives the best treatment from the start.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Why are genotyping rates so low?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong><em> Various factors contribute to oncologists not comprehensively genotyping their patients before starting treatment, including physician-reported gaps in the knowledge and skills needed to incorporate genotyping into clinical practice; challenges in keeping track of the latest recommendations; the time frame associated with getting complete genotyping results using tissue biopsies; and the cost of tests when not covered by insurance.<sup>5,8,9</sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Also, historically, oncologists have relied on tissue biopsies which can often take 21 days to return results. With liquid biopsies, two of </em>which were recently FDA approved, oncologists,<em> can receive comprehensive genomic results from a simple blood draw in a week, helping them move beyond the limitations of tissue biopsies to match patients with the best treatments faster. Obtaining clinically relevant genomic information through a simple blood draw also potentially helps patients avoid an additional tissue or surgical biopsy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Q8.&nbsp; Last year, the campaign focused on NSCLC, so what will be other indications that could be incorporated in the coming years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong><em> The<a href=""https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2021/cancer-facts-and-figures-2021.pdf""> American Cancer Society</a> estimates that in 2021 lung cancer and colorectal cancer will be the first and third cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., respectively. Currently, the campaign is focused on the cancers that have the greatest unmet medical need and have more effective targeted therapies aimed at biomarkers. However, there is a great opportunity to increase awareness of the need for biomarker testing in other cancer indices including advanced breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, and bladder cancers.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Q9. Why do you think there is a need for awareness campaigns in oncology? How is it helping patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong><em> Although the Clear Your View campaign is targeted at oncologists, the broader goal is to advocate for patients with advanced cancers so that they can receive the most comprehensive testing and targeted first-line treatments that will hopefully extend their progression-free survival. Campaigns like this one provide a unique opportunity to educate and inform not only healthcare providers but policy makers, payers, patients, and the general public on all of the latest testing and treatment options that are available for patients diagnosed with cancer.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> “<em>The<strong><a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1915341?query=main_nav_lg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">&nbsp;New England Journal of Medicine</a></strong>&nbsp;recently published results from the Phase III BLOCKSTONE study, which evaluated Xofluza compared with placebo as a preventive (prophylactic) treatment for household members (adults and children) who were living with someone who had been diagnosed with influenza.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the study, Xofluza showed a significant prophylactic effect on influenza infection after a single oral dose in people exposed to an infected family member. The proportion of household members who became symptomatically ill following infection with influenza was significantly lower in those treated preventively with Xofluza compared to those treated with placebo (proportion of household members with influenza virus infection, fever and other flu symptoms in the 10-day observation period: 2% versus 14%, p&lt;0.0001, demonstrating an 86% reduction in risk). Xofluza was well tolerated, with no safety signals identified.”</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How do results from P-III MINISTONE-2 study and P-III CAPSTONE 1&amp;2 study fit in with P-III BLOCKSTONE?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> “<em>We have robust clinical data supporting Xofluza as a treatment for influenza in multiple patient populations, including otherwise-healthy (CAPSTONE-1) and high-risk patients with influenza (CAPSTONE-2). The miniSTONE-2 data evaluating Xofluza in children age 1 to 12 with influenza, along with the BLOCKSTONE data looking at Xofluza as a prophylactic treatment for influenza add to the body of evidence supporting Xofluza in additional patient populations and treatment settings, and we continue working with the FDA to potentially expand the use of Xofluza in these settings.</em>”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you share some details on the novel mechanism of the Xofluza?</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How do you think Baloxavir can help reduce the risk of transmission, mainly in influenza outbreaks?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> “<em>Influenza is highly contagious and is transmitted in airborne respiratory droplets when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also live on some surfaces for up to 48 hours and can spread if someone touches the surface and then touches their mouth or nose.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> “<em>According to the CDC, the 2019-2020 flu season was one of the worst influenza seasons for children in the past decade.

<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>Do you think Xofluza can be effective as a potential treatment for COVID-19 anywhere in the future?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Neil:</strong> “<em>No. Xofluza is FDA-approved to treat influenza in people 12 years of age and older who have had influenza symptoms for no more than 48 hours and who are otherwise healthy or at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. Although some of the symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza can look similar, the two illnesses are caused by completely different viruses. Xofluza is specifically designed to treat influenza viruses only and has not been proven to be effective to treat human coronaviruses such as COVID-19.”</em><br><br><strong>Image Source:</strong> Medical News Today</p>

<p>In a recent interview with PharmaShots, <strong>Ted Omachi, Global Development Leader for Xolair, and Senior Medical Director of Product Development for Immunology, Genentech </strong>shared his views on the approval of Xolair in the US.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The approval is based on P-III POLYP 1 &amp; 2 trials assessing Xolair vs PBO in 138 &amp; 127 adult patients with nasal polyps who had an inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids respectively</li><li>Results: @24wks. improvement in NPS (-1.1 vs 0.1 &amp; -0.9 vs -0.3); improvement in NCS (-0.9 vs -0.4 &amp; -0.7 vs -0.2); no new or unexpected safety signals were identified respectively</li><li><strong>Xolair </strong>is the first biologic for the treatment of nasal polyps that targets and blocks IgE. In the US, Novartis &amp; Genentech work together to develop and co-promote Xolair</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>Can you please shed some light on Nasal Polyps? (causes, symptoms, epidemiology, etc.)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> <em>Approximately 13 million people in the U.S. are impacted by nasal polyps, a commonly occurring condition in adults that may be refractory to treatments such as nasal corticosteroids and even surgery. Nasal polyps present as noncancerous growths on the lining of the nasal sinuses or nasal cavity associated with irritation and inflammation and, as such, they can block normal airflow. Nasal polyps may also co-occur with other respiratory conditions, such as allergies and asthma. They may become quite large and develop in both nostrils, leading to a loss of smell, nasal congestion, chronic runny nose, and post-nasal drip. This condition can cause significant long-term symptoms and impact on patients’ lives. While the pathophysiology of nasal polyps is not entirely elucidated, we know that it is an inflammatory condition in which immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays an important role.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>A quick highlight of clinical data submitted for the approval of Xolair in nasal polyps to the U.S. FDA.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> <em>The FDA’s approval is based on results from the Phase III POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 pivotal trials conducted in adult patients. To be enrolled in the study, patients needed to have large polyps in both nostrils and significant symptoms, with persistent symptoms and large polyps even after treatment with nasal steroids. Patients were then given either Xolair or placebo, in a blinded fashion, while continuing to receive nasal steroids. Patients who received Xolair had statistically significantly greater improvements, as compared to placebo, over the approximate six-month duration of the study, from baseline to Week 24, in both of the co-primary endpoints: Nasal Polyp Score (NPS) and Nasal Congestion Score (NCS). NPS is an objective measure of the size of the polyps, as determined by endoscopy, while NCS is a measure of the degree of nasal blockage, as determined by patients’ assessment of their own symptoms. The greater improvements in NPS and NCS in the Xolair group as compared to the placebo group were observed as early as the first assessment at Week 4 in both studies. They also had statistically significant improvements in smell, post-nasal drip, and runny nose. The safety profile in POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 was consistent with the established safety profile for Xolair, which is based on more than 17 years of real-world experience in allergic asthma and more than 1.3 million patient-years of usage in clinical practice.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>Can you explain how Xolair works for nasal polyps (mechanism of action)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> <em>Xolair is the first biologic for the treatment of nasal polyps that targets and blocks immunoglobulin E (IgE), a key driver of inflammation. By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimizes the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>Can you provide some insights on RoA for Xolair in Nasal Polyps?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> <em>We do not comment on sales forecasts or projections.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Can our readers have more details on any ongoing and upcoming patients support programs and efforts for patient adherence?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> <em>As a physician, I know firsthand that adherence and access to medicines are some of the most important factors to ensure the safety and effectiveness of treatment for patients. At Genentech, we are committed to helping patients access to the medicines prescribed by their physician, even if they can’t afford them. For more than 20 years, we have helped more than 2.2 million people get the medicine they need through patient assistance programs like Genentech Access Solutions and the Genentech Patient Foundation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>Xolair is now approved in multiple indications including allergic asthma, CIU and nasal polyps. What’s next?</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>Are you focusing on approvals in different countries?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> <em>Xolair is approved for nasal polyps-related conditions in several countries outside of the U.S. In August 2020, the European Commission approved Xolair as add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) for whom therapy with intranasal corticosteroids does not provide adequate disease control. Additionally, Xolair is approved in more than 10 other countries throughout the world for nasal polyps or CRSwNP. Further regulatory reviews of Xolair to treat patients with CRSwNP (often referred to as nasal polyposis) are currently underway in multiple countries.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>What kind of pricing difference shall be expected for Xolair for Nasal Polyps vs. Xolair for other indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> <em>When determining the prices of our medicines, we take into consideration a number of factors including clinical benefit, patient access, investments required for future medications, and our responsibility to patients, society, and shareholders. The dosing of Xolair for nasal polyps and allergic asthma depends on the patient's weight and serum IgE levels, which affects the cost of therapy.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: How do you think this approval (self-administration) is going to help patients?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> <em>“If a self-administration option for Xolair is approved by the FDA, it would offer more flexibility for appropriate patients. We recognize that even under normal circumstances, there is a significant burden to patients and the healthcare system by having a universal requirement for administering Xolair in the healthcare setting. During the COVID-19 pandemic, where some of these patients might be at high-risk for severe disease, there’s an even more urgent need to allow Xolair injections at home for appropriate patients.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: A quick highlight of clinical data submitted for the sBLA submission of Xolair to the US FDA?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> <em>“Independent clinical studies involving patients with allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) on Xolair treatment suggest that Xolair may be self-administered with proper training and monitoring, for appropriate patients as determined by a healthcare provider. The sBLA includes a summary of th</em><em>ese studies as well as additional materials such as the safety data, the rationale for self-administration, human factors studies examining the ability of patients and caregivers to self-administer, and a review of factors that HCPs might use in determining what patients are appropriate for self-administration”<strong></strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Ted:</strong> <em>“If approved, the Xolair self-administration option would cover all U.S. indications.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Pulmonologists identified 12 strong to moderate predictors of future COPD exacerbations, some of which were evaluated less frequently</li><li>When evaluating COPD traits, pulmonologists were most likely to evaluate behavioral traits, exacerbation history and recovery time rather than traits that require testing, as acknowledged by the standard of care (<a href=""https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/goldcopd.org/gold-reports/__;!!AoaiBx6H!mc1m__SUF3zftDcgPxUXBcP2In-QHx1Drcorb6W9STw0nINjlxwqhOTf81zDUSkp$"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">GOLD guidelines</a>). </li><li>Community-based pulmonologists play an important role in the management of COPD, and the majority of respondents were also in a position to influence COPD management practices of colleagues.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Please discuss the epidemiology of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Riju:</strong> <em>COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive lung disease. There are more than&nbsp;16.4&nbsp;million people in the U.S. that are diagnosed with COPD, and it is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. While there is no cure for COPD, it is treatable, and with daily management, those with the disease can maintain good quality of life.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><strong> Can we have a key point of the whitepaper published in Chest Clinical Perspectives in a non-scientific way?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Riju:</strong> <em>In the recent study funded by GSK and co-developed by CHEST and GSK, we assessed the approaches pulmonary specialists take when they think of managing COPD exacerbations (or flare-ups) and what clinical perspectives come to mind when they consider future risk of these COPD exacerbations for their patients. These COPD exacerbations, or COPD flare-ups, speed up lung function decline and often lead to hospitalizations, which impact the health and quality of life for people with COPD. Research shows that frequent exacerbations that require hospitalization are also associated with higher mortality. Hospitalizations also lead to greater impact on daily life, decreased ability to work and increased burden on family caregivers, so it is important to help people with COPD reduce their chances of experiencing a COPD exacerbation.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><strong> What were the objectives of the research conducted by CHEST?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Riju:</strong> <em>The objectives of the survey were to:</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Assess the frequency with which pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and behavioral traits of COPD patients are evaluated in pulmonology practices.</em><em></em></li><li><em>Assess which disease characteristics pulmonologists use to predict the occurrence and severity of exacerbations in patients with COPD, including those who have no history of exacerbations.</em><em></em></li><li><em>Identify barriers to assessing these disease characteristics in pulmonology practices.</em><em></em></li><li><em>Assess how often pulmonologists are actively involved sharing their knowledge of COPD treatment and management with their referring primary care physicians.</em><em></em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><strong> Discuss the role of pulmonologists in improving the management of COPD.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Riju:</strong> <em>Pulmonologists work with patients to develop a proper COPD management plan and participate in the development of treatment plans. Pulmonologists are also in a position to better educate their referral primary care physicians. According to the survey, COPD is frequently underdiagnosed, which may be partially due to primary care physicians’ (PCPs) lacking knowledge on the disease. It’s important for pulmonologists to utilize their position to educate PCPs on how to administer tests, and interpret results, and plan tailored disease management plans for their patients with COPD.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><strong> &nbsp;What were the findings of the research conducted by CHEST/GSK?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Riju:</strong> <em>The survey uncovered a few key insights on COPD exacerbation predictors and the role of pulmonologists in better managing future COPD exacerbation risk:</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>There are 12 strong disease characteristics that pulmonologists determined to be predictors of a COPD exacerbation.</em><em></em></li><li><em>Pulmonologists are more likely to evaluate behavioral traits that do not require testing than pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors.</em><em></em></li><li><em>Most (71%) of pulmonologists surveyed use a strategy-based approach like the GOLD while 29% said their management approach is dependent on a patient’s symptoms<strong>.</strong></em><em></em></li><li><em>The opportunity to educate other physicians on COPD management and exacerbation prevention is not utilized.In fact, only 16% of respondents said they make a routine practice of proactively engaging or informally educating referring physicians on how to evaluate and manage COPD.</em><em></em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><strong> Can you showcase the GOLD guidelines used by the pulmonologist?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Riju:</strong> <em>The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy document is used broadly by physicians to guide COPD treatment plans. It categorizes patients according to their level of airflow limitation, symptoms, and comorbidities, and disease stages. However, patients symptom burden and exacerbation history are recommended as 2 key guiding principles for determining optimal treatment. Patients grouped in the same stage of the disease often have variation in symptoms, exacerbations, and risk of mortality, so understanding how to identify and test those characteristics is important to developing a personalized treatment plan.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><strong> What were the different traits evaluated by the pulmonologist during the research?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Riju:</strong> <a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__null&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=qwStF0e4-YFyvjCeML3ehA&amp;r=v34g5JKVW8IIcWgKIHUJJrfiJAZSqNSDWCTuVc9mZhM&amp;m=p_ejltKRFwXM6wIESuC0KRKC0X1uH0BXggDQjoix8DY&amp;s=yh6CAr_ubaC70gyoxLFdyCJ-Sk4GGxlfQGx3oItgXHE&amp;e="" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>In the survey, pulmonologists evaluated various behavioral, pulmonary and extrapulmonary traits and determined 12 strong COPD exacerbation predictors. The behavioral characteristics include treatment adherence, tobacco use, exacerbation history (especially exacerbations leading to hospitalizations), which do not require testing. Pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors include frailty or airflow limitation, which are evaluated less frequently. This study emphasizes the importance of pulmonologists’ recognition of disease characteristics, laboratory testing, in-office assessments and physician education when developing treatment plans.&nbsp;</em></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>When testing-based characteristics are not routinely evaluated as indicated by surveyed pulmonologists, it creates an overdependence on physician-patient communication. While this study did not specifically address communication, we know that both patients and physicians think there is room for improvement in terms of physician-patient communication during medical appointments. It is an extremely important component of the patient-physician relationship and should be considered in any disease management plan.</em><em></em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><strong> What are the different predictors of future COPD exacerbations? What you consider is the best predictor for exacerbation?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Riju:</strong> <em>The best predictor for an exacerbation is exacerbation(s) history; however, it is important for pulmonologists to evaluate other disease characteristics, especially in the absence of exacerbation history. A focus on behavioral elements like smoking cessation and adhering to their treatments especially controller medicines also ranked high from the surveyed pulmonologists. Regardless of exacerbation history, recent studies suggest triple therapy with an ICS, LAMA, and LABA showed the greatest benefit for improving both lung function and preventing exacerbations.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><strong> What are the educational benefits of using an approach to COPD management?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Riju:</strong> <em>As mentioned, COPD is frequently under-diagnosed, so it is important for pulmonologists to utilize all tools available to them between in-office testing, reference of GOLD and evaluation of a patient’s health history when treating people with COPD symptoms. It’s also critical pulmonologists engage PCPs</em> <em>in formal or informal education activities to improve patient care from the front line.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><strong> Why do you think COPD management is necessary to improve the condition of patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Riju:</strong> <em>Like any disease, proper disease management is essential to ensuring patients receive optimal care and lead a high quality of life as possible. COPD can worsen over time, especially for people who experience frequent exacerbations, but patients don’t have to settle for a life of breathlessness. Better days are possible for people living with COPD through consistent and comprehensive disease management.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the clinical data supporting the approval of BENLYSTA for adult patients with active lupus nephritis (LN) in EU.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mike: </strong><em>On behalf of GSK, I’m delighted that on May 5, we announced that BENLYSTA (belimumab) was approved in the EU in combination with background immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis (LN), which is a serious inflammation of the kidneys and a debilitating manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Once again, following FDA approval in the US on December 20, BENLYSTA became the first and only biologic to be approved for both SLE and LN.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The EU approval is based on the positive two-year results of the BLISS-LN clinical trial, the largest phase 3 study conducted in active LN</em><em>. In BLISS-LN, belimumab added to standard therapy increased response rates over two years and prevented worsening of kidney disease in patients with active LN compared to standard therapy alone. The addition of BENLYSTA to standard therapy resulted in a 49% decrease in risk to patients experiencing a renal-related event as well as a significantly higher number of study participants reaching </em><em>renal response.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What does this new indication in Europe mean for the lupus community?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mike: </strong><em>The expanded use of BENLYSTA in the EU marks</em><em> </em><em>a significant treatment advance for patients and physicians across Europe dealing with this complex autoimmune disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Active LN can occur in approximately 40% of adults with SLE and, in Europe, approximately 30% of people with SLE have biopsy-confirmed LN. For years, we have not been able to achieve remission for more than one-third of patients with LN and, despite all of our efforts with current treatments, 10% to 30% of patients with lupus kidney disease still progress to end-stage kidney disease. The data from the BLISS-LN study show that BENLYSTA added to standard therapy in the management of active LN may lead to improved long-term outcomes for patients by both increasing response rates and delaying further kidney disease progression.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mike: </strong><em>BENLYSTA, a BLyS-specific inhibitor, is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble BLyS. BENLYSTA does not bind B cells directly or directly deplete B cell populations. By binding BLyS, BENLYSTA inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>When BENLYSTA was first approved in 2011, it was the first treatment developed and approved specifically for SLE in more than 50 years. Today, as the first</em> biologic approved for both SLE and LN, our portfolio stands strong on an unmatched body of clinical evidence that has established efficacy in a broad base of lupus patients, shown long-term real-world outcomes,<em> and has provided a well-recognized safety profile.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Following the US and EU, in what other markets is GSK exploring approvals of BENLYSTA?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mike: </strong><em>For general SLE, BENLYSTA is approved in more than 70 countries. BENLYSTA is approved in the USA, Brazil, Japan and now the European Union for adult patients with active LN. We have submitted applications for adult LN in countries such as China (CDE), Canada, Switzerland, Russia, and Taiwan with more filings to come in the coming year.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mike: </strong><em>It’s important to understand that organ damage begins to accrue early in SLE.</em><em> With BENLYSTA now approved by the European Commission for adult patients with active LN, healthcare professionals in Europe </em><em>have an option that can help treat appropriate patients early – and when we can treat earlier, we can slow down the progression of organ damage.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In BLISS-LN, the study supporting the EU approval, belimumab added to standard therapy increased response rates over two years and prevented worsening of kidney disease in patients with active LN compared to standard therapy alone. The addition of BENLYSTA to standard therapy resulted in a 49% decrease in risk to patients experiencing a renal-related event as well as a significantly higher number of study participants reaching the renal response primary endpoint.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can you speak to the lifecycle innovation behind BENLYSTA?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mike: </strong><em>Since 2011, GSK has been conducting the largest global post-approval research program in lupus investigating BENLYSTA in a number of different aspects of the disease, and we are proud of what we have been able to deliver. We’ve now had five consecutive successful pivotal trials. In addition to the BLISS-LN study, which was the basis of the current approval, in the past two years alone, we delivered results for the largest study ever conducted in lupus (BASE), our pediatric study (PLUTO), which resulted in indications in children five and older in US, Europe, Japan, and China – the first of their kind; our study in the black race (EMBRACE), and real-world evidence on the delayed progression of long term organ damage. Additionally, we have an ongoing Phase 3 trial, BLISS-BELIEVE, evaluating BENLYSTA plus a single cycle of Rituximab (RITUXAN), which is aimed at demonstrating sustained disease control while minimizing immuno-suppressants and steroids.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We look forward to working with the scientific and advocacy communities to continue to innovate and raise the bar for what is possible for the lupus community, including additional study milestones in 2021 and beyond.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;After 10 years on the market, BENLYSTA continues to grow. What do you think has contributed to this growth?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mike: </strong><em>We are committed to following the science in lupus, transforming the standard of care for people with lupus, building on decades of research, and leading with a significant investment in the science of the immune system. The coming decade will see physicians moving progressively to a targeted approach to lupus, addressing the underlying causes, modifying the disease, and improving outcomes for patients.</em> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We have an unmatched body of clinical evidence that has established efficacy in a broad base of lupus patients, shown long-term real-world outcomes, and has provided a well-recognized safety profile.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Approximately 75% of people with SLE who may be eligible for a biologic are not one on today, so we believe there is a significant additional opportunity for growth for BENLYSTA.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;GSK always has a strong presence at EULAR. What were you most excited about this year?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mike: </strong><em>EULAR is one of the most important Rheumatology conferences of the year, so it’s something we always look forward to. Given its proximity to our expanded indication approval in the EU, we were excited to focus more on the science and unmet need within LN.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Also, for the first time this year, we focused on the role of eosinophils in inflammation and disease. Overall, we’re making real progress in our focus on the science of the immune system and our presence this year reflected these strides.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Tell us more about BENLYSTA’s approval in active lupus nephritis (LN) and how BENLYSTA works?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> <em>On behalf of GSK, I’m proud that on December 16, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) </em><em>approved BENLYSTA (belimumab) for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis (LN) who are receiving standard therapy. First approved in 2011 for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), BENLYSTA is the first and only approved treatment for both SLE and LN in more than 50 years.&nbsp; </em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The approval of BENLYSTA in adults with active LN who are receiving standard therapy is a profound advancement for the lupus community, as now healthcare professionals have a treatment option that works across the spectrum of SLE and LN and can further improve outcomes for those living with the disease.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>LN, one of the most common organ manifestations of lupus, can lead to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant.&nbsp;The approval extends the current indication in the US to include both SLE and LN for both the intravenous and subcutaneous formulations.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>BENLYSTA, a BLyS-specific inhibitor, is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble BLyS. BENLYSTA does not bind B cells directly. By binding BLyS, BENLYSTA inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you discuss the epidemiology of LN?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> <em>At least 5 million people worldwide have a form of lupus, and as the most common form of the disease, SLE accounts for approximately 70% of all cases.</em><em> </em><em>In the US, approximately 330,000 people have SLE; of those, LN can occur in up to 40% of adults with SLE. Although women are disproportionately affected by SLE, men with SLE are more likely to develop LN than women with SLE. </em><em><sup></sup></em><em><sup></sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>SLE is a chronic, incurable, autoimmune disease associated with a range of symptoms that can fluctuate over time including painful or swollen joints, extreme fatigue, unexplained fever, skin rashes and organ damage. In LN, SLE causes kidney inflammation (swelling or scarring) of the small blood vessels that filter waste in your kidney (glomeruli) and sometimes the kidneys, by attacking them like they would attack a disease. LN can lead to ESKD, which could require dialysis or a transplant.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The goal of treating lupus nephritis is to achieve a </em>renal response, prevent relapse/flares and progression to ESKD while minimizing treatment toxicity. Despite improvements in both diagnosis and treatment over the last few decades, LN remains an indicator of poor prognosis. Historically, only 40-50% of LN patients have responded to standard therapies for the disease. Standard therapies did not help as many patients achieve a <em>renal response.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>With this new indication for BENLYSTA, GSK has the potential to address a significant unmet medical need for the lupus community. Healthcare professionals now have a treatment option that may help improve the lives of people living with this potentially fatal condition.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is the company planning to explore the potential of BENLYSTA in other indications? If yes, what are those indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> <em>Due to the unmet need of patients with SLE and GSK’s focus on research and development of medicines for people living with lupus, we continue to investigate SLE in various populations and have initiated post-approval research programs to look at different ways of treating. Approximately 80% of patients with SLE who may be eligible for a biologic are not currently receiving one. So, there is tremendous opportunity for growth overall.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>GSK has a long history in lupus R&amp;D, we are extremely proud of what we have been able to deliver through the BENLYSTA program. We’ve now had five consecutive successful pivotal trials. In addition to the BLISS-LN study, which was the basis of the current Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and approval, in the past two years alone the immense BENLYSTA lifecycle program delivered results for the largest study ever conducted in lupus (BASE), our pediatric study, (PLUTO), which resulted in indications in children five and older in US, Europe, Japan and China – the first of their kind; our study in the black race (EMBRACE), and real-world evidence on the delayed progression of long term organ damage. Additionally, we have an ongoing Phase 3 trial, BLISS-BELIEVE, evaluating BENLYSTA plus a single cycle of Rituximab (RITUXAN), which is aimed at demonstrating</em> sustained disease control while minimizing immuno-suppressants&nbsp;and steroids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Please explain the Phase 3 study supporting the efficacy of BENLYSTA in adults with active LN.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> <em>BLISS-LN&nbsp;is&nbsp;a Phase 3, 104-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&nbsp;study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BENLYSTA&nbsp;10 mg/kg IV plus standard therapy (mycophenolate mofetil for induction and maintenance, or cyclophosphamide for induction followed by azathioprine for maintenance, plus steroids) compared to placebo plus standard therapy in adult patients with active&nbsp;LN.&nbsp;Active&nbsp;LN&nbsp;was confirmed by&nbsp;renal&nbsp;biopsy during screening visit using the 2003 International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society criteria&nbsp;within the past 6 months, and clinically active kidney disease&nbsp;requiring induction therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The BLISS-LN study is the largest and longest Phase 3 study conducted in active LN, involving 448 adult patients. The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that a statistically significant greater number of patients achieved&nbsp;Primary Efficacy Renal Response (PERR) at two years (or 104 weeks) when treated with BENLYSTA plus standard therapy compared to placebo plus standard therapy in adults with active LN (43% vs 32%, odds ratio (95% CI) 1.55 (1.04, 2.32), p=0.0311).&nbsp;Statistical significance compared to placebo across all four major secondary endpoints&nbsp;was achieved, including Complete Renal Response and Time to Renal Related Event or Death. The safety results are consistent with the known&nbsp;safety profile of BENLYSTA.&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you evaluating the efficacy of BENLYSTA in infants and pregnant women?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> <em>BENLYSTA is currently FDA approved for </em><em>the treatment of patients aged </em><em>5 years and older</em><em> with active, autoantibody-positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We have a registry established to monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to BENLYSTA. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to enroll themselves by calling 1-877-681-6296.&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;</em><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the other targeted countries for seeking approval in LN?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> <em>For general SLE, BENLYSTA IV is approved in more than 70 countries, with the subcutaneous formulation approved in more than 40 countries. We have submitted applications for adults with active LN in the EU (EMA), China (CDE), Canada, Brazil, Switzerland, Russia, and Taiwan with more to come in the coming months.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does the addition of BENLYSTA to the standard therapies help people with lupus or LN?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> <em>Historically, only 40-50% of LN patients achieve a renal response with standard therapies. Even when the renal response is achieved, it’s difficult to maintain, and up to a third of patients experience a renal flare or relapse. Significantly more patients on BENLYSTA received renal response versus standard therapy alone and showed a significantly reduced risk of kidney worsening.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This approval builds on nearly 10 years of experience in lupus post initial approval. With its deep history and heritage in lupus R&amp;D, GSK is committed to improving the lives of patients living with the disease with therapeutics.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do we have few details about BENLYSTA Cares? Are there any other patient support/adherence programs running/planned by GSK?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> <em>BENLYSTA Cares is a US patient support program that provides financial support, a phone helpline, injection support, and education to provide patients with the confidence they need to start BENLYSTA or BENLYSTA subcutaneous. For more information, please contact 1-877-4-BENLYSTA or BENLYSTA.com.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>GSK is actively involved in creating solutions that allow patients to have access to new scientific breakthroughs. We remain committed to helping patients access GSK medications and have a long history of providing patient assistance programs. Patients and healthcare professionals who need help with prescription coverage should visit www.BENLYSTA.com or call 1-877-4-BENLYSTA (1-877-423-6597)&nbsp;for eligibility information.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you planning for any digital initiative to improve the lives of patients with LN and other autoimmune diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> <em>GSK is continuing to expand its patient marketing for BENLYSTA in all media channels, including social, web search, point-of-care and targeted TV.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>One initiative that we’re particularly proud of is our Us in Lupus program, which is a 12-week virtual education program for those newly diagnosed with SLE and now LN, providing resources such as education, a patient journal, and symptoms tracker to help people have honest and open conversations with their healthcare team. Through the <a href=""http://www.UsInLupus.com"">www.UsInLupus.com</a> and corresponding Facebook community, we hope this also serves as a reminder that those living with lupus are not alone, and that others living with lupus have found help, self-confidence, and strength.</em></p>

61525,PharmaShots Interview: Impact of new regulations and trends in the medical device industry in India - interviews of Dr. Bina Naik and Dr. Ashish Indani during DIA Medical Device Conference 2020,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Medical Devices Conference was hosted by DIA India on 21st and 22nd February in collaboration with the Medical Technology Association of India (MTaI), AIC-AMTZ Medivalley Incubation Council and mDI Europa, is one of the largest gatherings of medical devices professionals in the region. The conference was focused on giving better insights into the challenges and opportunities in the design and developments of medical devices plus the techniques to increase the rates for the successful launch of medical devices from its pre-clinical strategies to the successful marketing of products.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shiwani: Please highlight the impact of new regulations on the Medical Device Industry from a service provider view. </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Naik: </strong><em>“My area of expertise is with regards to the clinical investigation and clinical evaluation part of it. So, earlier there was no guidance about these aspects, but with the new MDR in place, we foresee a lot of requirements that are coming up in the post-market registry type of trials that we are anticipating. In a situation where we had no regulation, bring more devices under regulations is going to be helpful for the device manufacturing community as well as all other stakeholders and primarily I believe for the patients or the healthcare segment. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shiwani:</strong> <strong>Can you also provide us some insights and trends in the Medical Device Industry</strong> <strong>in India?</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Naik: </strong><em>""</em><em>Talking about the trends in the medical device industry in India has a mix of both, the multinational players and the domestic players. Multinational players by default have always been adherent to the quality aspects because they have been also present in the international and the regulated market. Now the domestic manufacturers will have to re-evaluate quality systems and they will have to demonstrate that they are following the quality-related aspects in their manufacturing process which is a welcome step for the market. The changes in the regulatory scenario will truly help to showcase the capabilities and in bringing out the quality of the device”. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shiwani: Will the economy be affected by the upcoming regulation in the Medical Devices industry?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Naik<em>: </em></strong><em>“I don’t think so. I think the prices are controlled by a different authority in the govt. of India and I don’t think that MDR will have any impact or it will directly be related to the price lifting. I think they are two independent activities, price control will raise more from the point of view of raising the masses especially those patients and population who are not able to afford the medical devices which are relatively costly and they are a burden to the family. As a doctor, I have seen people sell their properties and homes so that they can treat their loved ones. Price control to a large extent will make sure that the devices are rationally priced”.<strong> &nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shiwani: Give some highlights on the new upcoming regulations global as well as from India. What will be its effect on upcoming regulations in the medical device industry? </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Indani: </strong><em>“There are multiple regulations coming from all over the globe. As I said in my last session, EU-MDR is one of them which is just across the corner and in May, they are finishing their transition period. India-MDR is also across the corner, the US FDA has changed certain regulations along with Maldives, Malaysia, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Nigeria, Argentina, and Brazil. So, there are many regulations which have been changed. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>If I compare the regulations of India and all other countries, these are the regulations that have changed a bit of landscape. In fact, EU-MDR has changed the entire landscape, but when it comes to the Indian regulations, it is a big transit because till now we were considering only a few devices as regulated but now over the night all the things which can get classified as devices have come into the picture. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Now, with this entire difference, there is some stress which industries are going to face but unauthorized manufacturing of standard devices will go off completely</em>. <em>And those who are into different areas of manufacturing, they will try to come into the mainstream or they will extinguish. So, while extinguishing any business may not be a good idea and it can be a painful situation for the industrialists but still looking towards the criticality of the healthcare industry and particularly me being a doctor, I understand that extinct is very much required. So, either they must upgrade and be standard or get extinct. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The second important thing that is going to happen is that unorganized business is going to become an organized business, it’s going to create jobs, it’s going to create the opportunities of manufacturing in India. Till now, people were not taking the devices made in India because they were not regulated. It was not possible to get the free sale certificate or to receive the standardized outcome of the devices. Therefore, globally the devices were not accepted. Even if there are close to 500 companies manufacturing in India, only 4 can globally position their products. Now with this new regulation, every device will have to bare minimum standards and because of that, they will be at par with most of the regulations of the world. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The third major change that is going to happen is the cost is going to increase a little bit but at the same time, the business is going to increase many times. So, if that cost to benefit business is correctly matched and if the companies become successful in handling the entire medical device economics, then probably India in next five years will be close to a billion economy in medical devices alone. So, these are the 3 major things that I see that this regulation to going to bring an impact. However, in the short term there may be certain restlessness, problems or repulsions, but in India there no transition is averse so I will not be surprised if people start going into conferences and saying that regulations are not required anyways”.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shiwani: Can you provide some insights into trends of the Medical Device Industry?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Indani:</strong><em> “The Medical Device Industry </em>i<em>n India really does not have a “trend” but if I speak of the Global Medical Device Industry, talking about the revenues which are $23B now and anticipating $123B in 2025 are revenue shares for one segment of the medical devices. If I speak of the 2025 projections further, Medical devices alone are going to touch somewhere like 900-950B in all the developed and other developing countries which will be approximately 70% of the entire healthcare segment of the respective country. So, this is going to be a big market. Clinical research is going to develop, the technology is going to boom, the raw materials and the supplies are going to get some good days &amp; research and innovation are going to take a lot of better shape in the coming days. For example, from big devices now we have the rice grain-sized “pacemaker” which is another trial. So, space is going to reduce, and medical records are going to change from locker systems to hard disk systems or maybe the server systems and that way we will make a more efficient digital space than the hard copies can do”.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shiwani: As you mentioned that economically things will get affected, please explain to what level will it be affected by the regulation act?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Indani:</strong> <em>“Till today if we see, medical devices were not in price control, the reason being there was no regulation. India doesn’t recognize the medical device and no medical device was regulated as a drug. So now being classified as drugs, most of the medical devices may also be brought into price control. The second important thing, now every company must follow the standards. So, to follow the standards they will have to comply with the regulations and those regulations are at par with the global regulation, therefore, it will automatically open the global market for them, so we will have the opportunity to sell our product in the global marketplace and that way we will be able to build ourselves a stronger economy”.</em> </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Steven</u></strong>: <em>We are delighted that the EC has approved Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). aRCC significantly impacts those living with the disease around the world, and as such, this approval provides an important new first-line treatment option for patients living with this rapidly progressing disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Can you share the clinical data that supports the EC’s approval of Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Steven</u></strong>: <em>The approval is based on data from the pivotal Phase III CheckMate -9ER trial, which was presented during a Presidential Symposium at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 3 March 2021. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>These data showed that Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab doubled median progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those receiving sunitinib alone: 16.6 months versus 8.3 months, respectively. The combination also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in overall survival (OS), reducing the risk of death by 40% versus sunitinib, as well as significantly improved disease control rates, and a lower rate of discontinuation versus sunitinib. In addition, these data showed consistent efficacy benefits across key subgroups of patients, whilst also maintaining the quality of life.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Please find the full results published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) here: </em><a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026982""><em>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026982</em></a><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What does this approval mean for patients living with RCC in the European Union (EU)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Steven</u></strong>: <em>The approval of Cabometyx and nivolumab represents a potentially important treatment approach for previously untreated patients living with aRCC, whilst also maintaining the quality of life. While existing therapies improve outcomes for people living with aRCC, high rates of relapse and disease progression highlight the need for additional therapeutic options, regardless of risk status and consistent across prespecified subgroups. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What was the reason for the evaluation of the combination of nivolumab and cabozantinib in RCC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Steven</u></strong>: &nbsp;<em>The treatment paradigm in oncology is changing and combination therapies are becoming an important option for healthcare professionals in their sequencing decisions. The value of Cabometyx and nivolumab are already established within aRCC with robust supporting data, making it an important combination to evaluate in this indication.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does this combination regimen improve the HRQoL outcomes of patients living with RCC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Steven</u></strong>: <em>As shown in the NEJM publication, the combination of Cabometyx and nivolumab not only addresses key efficacy needs but also reflects the priorities of patients by providing a treatment option that does not compromise the quality of life. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data from CheckMate -9ER showed significantly better quality of life with the combination compared to sunitinib. Within the trial, both disease-specific patient-reported outcomes as measured by the kidney symptom index questionnaires and more general health-related patient-reported outcomes were measured. Together, these data suggest the combination was associated with a lower treatment burden, a decline in the risk of confirmed deterioration in HRQoL, and a reduction of disease-related symptoms compared to sunitinib.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are the other indications in which you are exploring Cabometyx?</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Steven</u></strong>: <em>Over the past three years, Cabometyx’s unique mode of action and robust data have become clear and we have a defined path to continue expanding on that in multiple tumor indications. Further planned advancements include Cabometyx in combination with immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC); all patient populations with significant unmet needs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;In which other regions is Ipsen seeking the approval of the combination regimen?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Steven</u></strong>: <em>Ipsen has an exclusive collaboration agreement for the commercialization of Cabometyx outside of the United States and Japan. We are working with a broad range of stakeholders within our territories to bring Cabometyx in this new combination regimen to patients.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Does Ipsen have any patient support programs or provide support for HCPs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Steven</u></strong>: <em>Ipsen has invested in a variety of patient support programs globally with the aim of supporting access to our innovative medicines for patients who need them most. These programs vary across the world and are developed and launched according to specific country needs.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What other programs/developments does Ipsen have/is Ipsen working on to increase its global footprint in oncology?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Steven</u></strong>: <em>Ipsen’s portfolio includes treatments for neuroendocrine tumors, prostate cancer, and cancers of the kidney, liver, pancreas, and breast. Focusing on these selected cancers, and through a culture of external innovation, Ipsen is now among the world’s top 14 pharmaceutical companies specializing in oncology. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As part of Ipsen’s Group strategy, we will accelerate and prioritize our most promising assets, while executing an ambitious and focused external innovation and business development plan. We will leverage the potential firepower of €3bn over the next four years to add 15-20 assets to our existing portfolio. In Oncology, we aim to identify assets with broad lifecycle management potential in the areas of niche solid or hematological tumors with high unmet needs or biomarker segments in broad tumors.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are Ipsen’s next steps for Cabometyx?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Steven</u></strong>: &nbsp;<em>Ipsen is currently evaluating Cabometyx in combination with other therapies in three Phase III trials:</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>COSMIC-312, evaluating Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab versus sorafenib in previously untreated advanced HCC. The co-primary endpoints of the trial are progression-free survival and overall survival.</em><em></em></li></ul>

59694,PharmaShots Interview: J&J's Sven Sjovall & Dr. Mark Watt Share Insight on Nicorette's Latest Digital Smoking Cessation Offering,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Sven Sjovall, Sr Director, R&amp;D Site Lead and Global Smoking Cessation, and Dr. Mark Watt, Senior Director Medical Affairs and Clinical Research at Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> share their views on Nicorette’s latest digital smoking cessation offering and the science behind the QuickMist SmartTrack. They also shed some light on the delicate angles like quitting during COVID-19, digital health, and the behavioral science around quitting smoking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The Nicorette Quickmist SmartTrack is the first of its kind, using NFC technology can simply tap your Quickmist spray against your phone (whilst the app is running) allowing you to keep full track of the progress</li><li>The easy to use spray gets to work in just 30 seconds and helps to relive and/or prevent withdrawal symptoms and reduce the cravings you get when you try to stop smoking</li><li>Each QuickMist spray comes with 150 sprays to give an instant release of nicotine, helping to brush off cravings. This spray can be used to either completely replace cigarettes or simply cut down the amount of smoke</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How does Nicorette work?&nbsp; What is the innovation behind Nicorette’s works?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sven:</strong> <em>First of all, two things that smokers are addicted to I would say, if you simplify a little bit, one is the nicotine addiction, that is delivered by the cigarettes, but they are also addicted to the behavioral pattern of being a smoker. So that is what we take into account when it comes to the product.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>&nbsp;We have developed Nicorette and our continuous innovations behind this is we are delivering nicotine via our product as we do it on our therapeutic level instead.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To be there to help the smokers to wean off nicotine, so they not only become smoke-free, but they also eventually become nicotine-free.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>And then we provide our products in quite many formats, we have chewing gums, lozenges, patches, and so forth, and that is also the format to deliver against the behavioral support need. Different smokers have different needs, so some smokers, for instance, would like to use our inhaler. The inhaler still mimics a little bit of that hand-to-mouth movement. As you're giving up smoking, of course, when others find chewing gum, for instance, a better format for them, so we provide a quite broad range of formats to help out. We developed this product, for the first time, a little bit more than four years ago when we didn't first think of Nicorette format being the gum. And have kept on doing more clinical trials on the formats since then.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>So, we have a vast number of clinical studies executed that have proven the effectiveness of our product. And I think we have studied it in more than 23,000 patients in our clinical programs over the years, so we know what it takes to stay in order to develop a very helpful product for smoking cessation.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How Nicorette help people to quit smoking during the lockdown (Covid19)?</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sven: </strong><em>We launched our latest innovation In United Kingdom in May 2020 which is our nicotine mouth spray, we call that QuickMist, it's a product that was already available, but we launched a digital version of it, so we call it QuickMist SmartTrack and that digital innovation was needed in a COVD-19 situation because going by a little bit to the behavior support aspect. When you're in a lockdown situation, you don’t have the same availability to your network, it could be your friends or your family and so for a year and even your healthcare practitioner could be with limited access. So, you're left alone in a COVID-19 lockdown situation. To have this amplifying the digital capabilities for the first time. We coordinated with an app and you can personalize it, the app can actually be your friend in that very loneliness.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mark: </strong><em>With COVID-19, there was an additional focus with the nature of the disease being a spiritual one and obviously smokers know that smoking is potentially harmful, I mean it's known to be harmful to the lungs. And so, in that situation, the question was whether or not there was an association between smoking and lungs, and so it was a sort of worse outcome of that. I think that's something that also drove people towards thinking about what we did and there has been some evidence of people moving towards attempting to quit smoking.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Certainly, considering very carefully what their options are and then looking for things in lockdown, particularly when people are shutting doors looking for things that they can use to address their smoking habit to reduce their risk. You know quite hopefully and also to avoid situations which might be exposing themselves to covid. It is the approach, which is known to be effective but is particularly effective with the circumstances of lockdown in covid-19 as well.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Where it is available, and now where are you planning to launch in 2021 and coming years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sven: </strong><em>In the nicotine replacement therapy, Nicorette was the original inventor and we're still the world leader in that space and, of course, being the biggest comes to the responsibility to keep on pushing towards innovation. We are the best-suited organization to do so. I think in this kind of a public setup, I cannot share the details or such a pipeline, but we have very interesting programs. In general, we are continuously building on our geographic expansion, that we would like our treatment to be more available to more and moreover the globe. The important aspect is to advance the effectiveness of our products. And here I think QuickMist SmartTrack is an excellent example where we are tapping into the digital opportunity to really improve the effectiveness of the treatment and we continue looking at the format. As I said, we have many formats and that's because there are many, many smokers out there and every smoker is unique and there's no one size fits all format for all smokers so we're also continuously looking towards the format that can make more relevant for us. Not only to drive the brand of new grads, but being the world leader, and we also have a responsibility to drive the relevance of the product so we can reach you and help more workers to quit<strong>.</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mark:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We need to get as many options into the hands of as many smokers, across the world. And that's very much the approach we want to take, and we do that, obviously, through developing good products and presumably work. But then also through partnerships with agencies &amp; groups such as who we've been working with them recently as well. Looking at the opportunities to try and take smoking cessation, and see new geographies &amp; new places, and it is identified as a critical product for addressing smoking cessation. And globally, we seek to take nicotine in as many formats as we can and as many places as we can globally and that's you know and SmartTrack will be a part of that role, as well as we continue to sort of taking these across the globe.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;According to you, which nicotine replacement product (gums, lozenges, patch) is better in quitting smoking?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mark: </strong><em>I think the first thing to recognize is every smoker is different, every smoker is unique and the things that drive smokers to continue smoking will differ by different motivations, different lifestyle factors. You know that there's a multitude of things that makes a smoker and keep someone a smoker. And so, rather than actually saying that anyone particular format is better than another, I think our belief is that there should be as many choices of formats as much as possible. In order to try and meet the different needs, that, people have whether it's a particular stage of life, a particular time of day or a particular you know part of their quitting journey if you like, and their attitude towards that so. As every writer writes different slogans using a variety of different methods so rather than anyone being more effective or potent or whatever to the other, what we find is that the smokers are seeking to quit and find a format that works for them. So same was mentioning before some people miss the action of actually bringing something to that lips and inhaling on that so again, we have a format that would be suitable for that, such as the QuickMist spray or the inhalers. Some people prefer to be able to chew on something, and so, though they might go for gums, some prefer to suck because again they can't choose which would be there in a workplace or something but that's not going to work so a lot of factors drives this such as lifestyle and the particular choice of smokers who start with a format and learn how to use it better. And you know, with time actually find that it becomes something which they can rely on and they can use and effectively throughout the duration of their quit. Because again in the same way smokers actually control the nicotine intake from cigarettes. They can control their intake of gums by chewing differently or by sucking a lozenge more aggressively. You know, a steady release format is something like a patch, which is obviously very discreet it's something you play at the start of each day. And it's something you don't have to think about again so for some people, that will be the kind of form that they wanted and they want to use in terms of it being discreet and something they don't necessarily have to think about. So there's not one form we would say is more effective, because a lot of it comes down to the individual, the individual smoker, the individual person looking to quit, and the kind of factors that will help say to keep them quit.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sven:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>On average, if you're motivated to quit, it takes like seven or eight times before you finally are able to quit. And, of course, when you're trying seven to eight times that also goes with what you're trying with, you could be potentially trying different formats. You tried one, it didn’t work for you, for various reasons but as to not discourage you should try to get back and really try to do the most important health decision in your life, I would say. You know, get back and try another format that could become better because our former time different kinds of characteristics, so our most passive format is of course the patch. We only do one action per day, as you smack on touch on to your skin once a day until it's a very passive form that gives you a constant level of the therapeutic level of nicotine. But then, on the other side, you are like the mouth spray and the inhaler where you very active or working with have and mouth movement. So, it's important we have all these forms because every smoker will realize when he quit attempt have a little bit of different personal needs in order to be successful.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mark:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We have the union of two discrete sets of clinical data that shows, you know its efficacy for what we're doing. So firstly, is the QuickMist device itself and that's obviously has been trialed previously and found to be about two and a half times more effective than placebo so in terms of actually driving. In Africa, we've got something that is more than doubled the chances of getting to a successful quit. And we were coupling that with behavioral support in the form of the APP which allows you to track and trace to receive tips and hints on how to stay on quitting. Things that can help develop willpower and maintain that willpower so active interventions and tracking your progress of health benefits and so on. And that kind of behavior support or ongoing fashion that can further increase the effectiveness of intervention and increased outcomes as well, so effectively we've been two data sets together in SmartTrack. We bring together the efficacy of the intervention itself and quickness and the efficacy of the behavior support that the APP is bringing together as well, and by having that work together so you can track your use of Quick Mist. With this sort of NFC chip, which you can track each usage by tapping into your phone. You get to see your progress in terms of how much you're using to support quit how it tracks against the number of cigarettes, which you can input and track as well. It'll help you to sort of track your progress and see how far you're getting in terms of cessation effectively and give you hints and tips to stay quit as well during that process, so I don't know if you've got anything else to add to that one as well Sven.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sven:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Behavioral science is a standalone scientific feeling itself when you quit smoking. You can do that in many different ways, you don't need to go buy a nicotine replacement therapy, as we are providing, of course, many of quitting in by other means. More behavioral support related, but it is significant in clinical evidence. We have our behavioral scientists who also been part of the development of this specific App, where the spotlight could also mention and when we develop for the SmartTrack, it was not only the scientists, own sitting and crafting the best possible content of the app. We actually co-created it also with smokers, so we had focus groups working together with us building the content of the app that resonates more to a smoker, you will also have the opportunity, in the App, when you're introducing yourself into the App. There are some fundamental questions to populate and check or uncheck so you can personalize the content of what makes the most sense or most motivating for you. I mean for some people is very motivated to understand money saved, for instance. If I don't buy cigarettes, how much money do actually save, no to doing that some people find that highly motivating? And then the App can include that while others might find I would like to be prompted by the early Friday evenings because a Friday evening is my pitfall, that's when I typically go to the restaurant and have those cigarettes, to contain the content of the App in a smart way.</em></p>

<p><em>You know one of the interesting things about SmartTrack is we are able to at least get an idea of how it's working within different age groups and we've looked at that during the development process and we</em> <em>look to see. You know how best to engage the different age people with the smartphone depending on which country you're in you know pretty much everybody's got a smartphone of some description there. And people spend a lot of time looking at smartphones and they use a lot of apps to help manage their diary, manage their life, manage their shopping list. You know, keep track of their kids, whatever is this is something which is becoming a trusted reference that they've trusted tool. And I think we're able to start to bring behavioral science much closer to the individual person who's quitting at any given time, and the idea of having effectively a kind of a quick buddy in your pocket is something which I think is very interesting compelling idea. So, in order to help people make the right choices, you know, in order to support somebody or answer a question or point when they actually tend to start quitting. Then, the hope and the belief are that they will reach for the kind of support and this kind of application, the digital form. And it will help to keep them on track, to know to sustain their will to quit and not only that but help them to get the best out of the treatments, that are using to try and support it. Okay, long the short of it is yes, absolutely these kinds of apps of digital interventions will be an integral part in supporting treatments in seeing people through to the appeal for don't come and get them close to what they're hoping to achieve in quitting.</em></p>

<p><em>I could add on that of course in all the historical clinical research executed in the field of nicotine replacement therapy, not only for Nicorette. We do know that in those traditional studies, where we had more interventions, you had more engagement from a healthcare professional, either through face-to-face or through telephone interactions, that kind of interaction increases your chances to quit. Now, with the opportunity with mobile phones all over the world, we can actually move that into the digital space, but again I’m coming back to the behavior support here. So basically, instead of having it and the necessity to physically meet adopted as it was in the past, now, you can actually have a quit partner in your pocket, you're carrying around your mobile phone already and to, as you pointed out more game and people are now getting more and more acquainted, to be able to change the digital environment. In general, it could be a diet, or whatever or you run cheaper so forth, so we are very confident but the digital opportunity and now opening up for us, through technology is a very interesting field to advance.</em></p>

<p><em>People are voting with their fingers technically rather than with their feet, I suppose, but we know that 45% of </em>smokers in the UK have used some sort of App during the course of that to help them get there, so we only see that going one direction and again if we can provide tailored support to help them using clinically proven therapy<em>, such as Nicorette then we think that the potential facility between those is very high.</em></p>

<p><em>In our smart product, there is no connection to </em>HCPs but to your point, that is also a very important aspect that you could envision in future development right. Not only a digital product but still maintain the good stuff, if I use that phrase when it comes to healthcare professional connection so. That is, of course, something we keep in mind to see how we can further build that ecosystem, you could say, or how can you as <em>quitting smoking or connect to the outside so that's something that's absolutely worth looking into.</em></p>

<p><strong>Mark:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We never get to the stage where we can replace healthcare professionals, but I think we really, we can certainly be in a position where we can augment and support and potentially even help healthcare professionals to even track the quits of the best work as well. But for those who aren't motivated to go and consult with healthcare professionals and the vast majority quit attempts are on without the assistance of a healthcare professional than having something like this. I certainly believe will augment their chances of quitting and getting a positive experience supposed to benefit from the for the penalty when used the correct product.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Does a J&amp;J have any patient engagement programs where you have regular engagements with patients to know about the product pricing and all any kind of patient engagement program that will benefit the patients?</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>When we are providing our products to the market, I mean one is to be very close to the consumer and it is very important and we do that with ongoing consumer research. Of course, the sales performance, to some extent also tells you if you're delivering the product in a good way. For consumer interaction is, of course, something we are the revenue of the quite the organization, we call them consumer business intelligence. For that product on the market, of course, when we do new product development, we always ensure we are close to the consumer perspective in the development phase. So, we have the focus group research you're testing and trying things and so forth, but I would say, it was very important for our brand and the healthcare professional community. That is what it is very important because if we can make our health care professional really understand in order to smoking cessation, they are very important to set of ambassadors that will say foot for the patients. To be able to really coach and work with their patients to stop smoking. Healthcare professional programs are something that we are working very actively on there is from market to market, it also depends on the maturity of the market as such. We do important programs in that space.</em></p>

<p><em>I mentioned earlier, that we've been working in partnership with organizations as well as with WHO to have patient access facilitated serenity products. In markets are the US, Jordan, Philippines we've worked in partnership with WHO to try and bring in it to smokers you otherwise may not have access to it. We do seek partnership, such as that we do work with the agencies to try and increase support to this works to enjoy.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Not just the product but also education around the importance of quitting smoking and so again, we would always be keen to enjoy the kind of relationships and promotes health education programs as smoking cessation programs. We were aware obviously as well and in the past been involved in national programs and in supporting the sort of rollout of smoking cessation programs and individual countries as well. But I mean just to quickly sort of reflecting back onto the digital side of things as well, one of the beauties of having digital support is that it will help both in terms of education around the potential arms and that it actually actively encourages you to quit because it gives you the health benefits of quitting as you're going through it. It also encourages people to get the best out of the products that they have in their possession. Straightforward to use intuitively to us, but again to get the best out of it something like and happen and support would actually help people to get more out of that as well. So it can be a form of real-time education that can actually support the use of a product such as QuickMist and help people get the most out of that as well. So I think we look for every opportunity to engage in education, to try and you know move people towards quitting, and when they're ready for it be there to help support them.</em></p>

<p><em>Those are very interesting programs in J&amp;J for the world and for the consumers in many spaces. We all know that if you are a smoker going into </em>heavy surgery, you're in a worse place coming out well in terms of your recovery, a smoker takes a longer time to recover after surgery. So, we also have that kind of cooperation within J&amp;J to provide the broadest possible solutions, so in that case, it's more like providing our Nicorette products let's say four weeks before operations. You have least smoke-free a month before going into surgery, and then also stay on the product. If the first month of recovery, then you have a much better profile of coming back so that's another way, we also constantly trying to contribute and help out in different kinds<em> of health situations.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Allitia:</strong> <em>PONVORY is a once-daily oral, cell-trafficking inhibitor that is selective for the S1P1 receptor and is the first and only oral disease modifying therapy approved by the FDA that was studied against an established oral comparator. PONVORY was proven superior to an older oral MS treatment in a Phase 3 study in reducing relapses and brain lesions, with proven safety and a generally well-tolerated profile.<br></em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the two-year Phase 3 study, PONVORY demonstrated superior efficacy in significantly reducing annual relapses and reducing the number of new gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) T1 lesions and the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions compared to teriflunomide. PONVORY also prevented disability from worsening for most people. While the difference in rates of disability progression was not statistically significant between the PONVORY and teriflunomide groups, nine in 10 PONVORY-treated patients did not have to worsen of 3-month disability. PONVORY demonstrated a safe and generally well-tolerated profile over more than 10 years of the cumulative clinical patient experience.<br><br>Adverse event rates were similar to placebo in the Phase 2 trial, and similar to teriflunomide in the Phase 3 trial, with an upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation (abnormal liver tests), and hypertension (high blood pressure) the most common side effects. Additionally, if a patient needs to stop treatment, PONVORY leaves the blood within a week, and its effects wear off in one to two weeks, which can be helpful for family planning and treating infections.<br></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>PONVORY does not rely on the destruction or genetic alteration of immune cells, unlike many current MS treatments, and is believed to work by sequestering immune cells called autoreactive lymphocytes in lymph nodes. The exact way PONVORY exerts therapeutic effects in MS is unknown, but it is presumed that PONVORY by keeping autoreactive lymphocytes out of circulation, that it prevents them from reaching the central nervous system where they could cause damage in MS.</em><br><br><strong>Tuba:  Briefly tell us about Janssen CarePath.

<p><strong><em>Dr. Allitia:</em></strong><em> There are future to evaluate PONVORY, but the exact details have not been finalized.</em><br><br><strong>Tuba:  As the PONVORY is available in the US, what is its cost?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Allitia:</strong> <em>PONVORY is similar in price point to other MS treatments.</em></p>

Also, discuss the pricing difference.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Allitia:</strong> <em>PONVORY is the first and only FDA-approved oral disease modifying that was studied against an established oral competitor, teriflunomide. In the two-year, Phase 3 study in adults with relapsing MS, PONVORY 20 mg proved superior on the primary endpoint of reduced annualized relapse rate (30.5% reduction vs. teriflunomide). Further, it significantly reduced the number of new GdE T1 lesions and the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As PONVORY provides superior reductions in annualized relapse rates and brain lesions compared to another oral treatment, alongside a safe and generally well-tolerated profile, we believe it is a significant addition to the MS treatment landscape.</em></p>

We are continuing to study STELARA in various clinical settings in the treatment of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Additionally, since gaining approval in the U.S. in 2017 for psoriasis and 2020 for psoriatic arthritis, we continue to expand our research of TREMFYA, which is currently being studied in the Phase 2 GALAXI clinical trial in Crohn’s disease, a Phase 2b/3 program in ulcerative colitis and two additional Phase 2 programs – one exploring biologic combination therapy in ulcerative colitis and the other for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa.

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Highlight the key points of the head-to-head study of Stelara presented at DDW. Can we have a detailed view of the efficacy &amp; safety findings of Stelara as it pertains to SEAVUE?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Bruce Sands:</strong> <em>SEAVUE is the first head-to-head, blinded, randomized controlled trial of two biologic agents for the treatment of Crohn's disease. It compares the use of adalimumab, which is the most widely prescribed biologic agent anti-TNF for Crohn's disease, to ustekinumab, an anti-p40 antibody that blocks IL-12 and IL-23.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In this head-to-head comparison, the primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at week 52. Although the study was designed for superiority, it was not demonstrated for ustekinumab, and the two agents appear to be roughly equally effective. However, it's important to note that these patients were naïve to biological therapies and also had a relatively short duration of disease, roughly about 2.58 years. Because of this, both treatment groups had very high clinical remission rates at the end of one year, approaching two-thirds of patients in each arm.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This study shows that both ustekinumab and adalimumab have similar efficacy and are effective treatments for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease and for patients who are biologic-naïve.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>There are a number of other nuances in the results of this study that seemed to show, numerically, fewer patients dropping out of the study for lack of efficacy in the ustekinumab arm. Although this was not statistically different, this was numerically superior in the ustekinumab arm.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additionally, there was a slightly greater trend numerically in this study of higher rates of infection and also of injection site reactions in the adalimumab arm. To contextualize these findings, it shows that both therapies are good options for the treatment of Crohn's disease, but the further context of the overall safety of these agents, as well as the convenience of dosing every eight weeks with ustekinumab as compared to every two weeks for adalimumab,</em> would suggest that ustekinumab may be a superior choice to adalimumab, even though this study didn't hit its primary endpoint in demonstrating the <em>superiority of clinical remission at week 52.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Both agents had similar efficacy with regard to endoscopic improvement, looking at the SES-CD score and clinical responses as well. Additionally, in terms of time to onset of effect, the drugs were similar.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bruce Sands:</strong> <em>With regard to the Crohn's disease landscape, the results suggest that both of these agents, adalimumab, and ustekinumab, are excellent choices for first-line biologic therapy of Crohn's disease. Additionally, because of the safety and the convenience of dosing of ustekinumab, this may suggest that ustekinumab may be a more desirable choice for many patients.</em></p>

<p><em>Patients were assigned to receive a </em>placebo or 200, 600,<em> or 1200 mg of guselkumab IV at weeks 0, 4, or 8, or the reference arm of ustekinumab according to the approved dosing regimen. Patients had analysis for change from baseline in their C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood biomarker fecal calprotectin (FeCal), and clinical-biomarker response which was defined as =a 100-point reduction from baseline in CDAI score or CDAI score &lt;150 and =50% reduction from baseline in CRP or fecal calprotectin. This is a way of incorporating an objective outcome of a biomarker along with clinical response.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In this analysis, it was found that patients treated with guselkumab had significantly greater reductions in CRP and FeCal compared to placebo. In addition, the proportion of patients who normalized their CRP if they had an abnormal CRP at baseline was significantly higher in the guselkumab group compared to placebo at week 12 (35.4% versus 19.4%, respectively). Similarly, the proportion of patients who normalized their FeCal, if it was abnormal at baseline, was 33.3% with guselkumab versus 27.3% for placebo at week 12.<br><br>At week 12, a higher proportion of patients treated with guselkumab achieved clinical-biomarker response compared to placebo (48% versus 7.8%, respectively).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Similar results were achieved in patients who had the previous failure of biologic therapies at week 12; 46.1% of guselkumab-treated patients achieved clinical-biomarker responses versus 8.7% of patients on placebo. In the conventional treatment failure cohort, 50% of guselkumab-treated patients versus 7.1% of patients on placebo achieved clinical-biomarker response at week 12.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Overall, the study results concluded that guselkumab is effective in reducing inflammatory biomarkers CRP and FeCal during induction therapy as compared to placebo. This was accomplished regardless of prior treatment failure with biologic therapies or merely with conventional therapies. Importantly, these changes in the inflammatory biomarkers typically had been accomplished by week 4, concluding that it is not just that we see this effect, but that this effect also happens fairly quickly in the course of therapy, which is important for patients who are seeking more rapid relief of their Crohn’s disease symptoms. &nbsp;</em></p>

<p>In a recent interview with PharmaShots, <strong>Kiran Patel, Vice President Clinical Development, Solid Tumor Franchise at Janssen</strong> shared his views on the regulatory submission of Amivantamab for the Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations.</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><em> </em><strong>A quick highlight of clinical data submitted for the BLA submission of Amivantamab to the US FDA?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kiran:</strong><em> On </em><em>December 3, 2020, Janssen <a href=""https://www.janssen.com/janssen-submits-application-us-fda-seeking-approval-amivantamab-treatment-patients-metastatic-non"">submitted a Biologics License Application</a></em><em> (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &nbsp;seeking approval of amivantamab for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The BLA is supported by data from the monotherapy arm of the Phase 1 </em><em><a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02609776"">CHRYSALIS</a></em><em> study, a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of amivantamab as a monotherapy and in combination with lazertinib, a novel third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in adult patients with advanced NSCLC.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The submission of this BLA is an important step as we hope to advance a new therapeutic option for patients with NSCLC and exon 20 insertion mutations for whom there are currently no approved targeted therapies. The current standard of care for EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutation-positive NSCLC is chemotherapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><em> </em><strong>What is the mechanism of action of Amivantamab and how does it work?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kiran:</strong><em> Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human, EGFR, and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) bispecific duo-body with immune-cell directing activity that targets tumors with activating and resistance EGFR and MET mutations and amplifications. As a monotherapy, amivantamab has shown activity in patients with diverse EGFR mutant disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><em> </em><strong>Why is Janssen focused on metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kiran:</strong><em> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In the U.S., lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women, after skin cancer and NSCLC makes up 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers. EGFR genetic alterations are among the most common driver mutations for NSCLC and are present in 10 to 15 percent of patients with NSCLC. Additionally, EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations identify a distinct subset of lung adenocarcinomas, accounting for at least nine percent of all EGFR mutations.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Currently, there are currently no FDA-approved targeted therapies for patients with NSCLC who have EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Given this significant unmet need, we are committed to improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with this complex, deadly disease. Janssen is committed to advancing targeted therapies for patients living with genetically defined lung cancer where there remains a high unmet need for new treatment options.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><em> </em><strong>When can we expect approval and launch of amivantamab in the US?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kiran:</strong><em> </em><em>The BLA submission was completed on December 3, 2020. In March 2020, amivantamab <a href=""https://www.janssen.com/janssen-announces-us-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-granted-jnj-6372-treatment-non-small-cell"">received</a></em><em> </em><em>FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which is granted to expedite the development and regulatory review of an investigational medicine that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition. We do not speculate on potential approval timelines.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><em> </em><strong>When can we expect results from the CHRYSALIS combination arm?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kiran:</strong><em> We presented <a href=""https://www.janssen.com/janssen-presents-findings-global-multi-center-trial-examining-amivantamab-combination-lazertinib"">interim data</a></em><em> from the CHRYSALIS combination arm at the ESMO 2020 Virtual Congress in September. Data showed the combination of amivantamab and lazertinib achieved a 100 percent overall response rate in the cohort of patients with treatment-naïve EGFR-mutated NSCLC. We look forward to the continued evaluation of amivantamab in combination with lazertinib in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><em> </em><strong>How many patients have been part of the expanded access program (EAP) in the US?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kiran:</strong><em> </em><em>Jansen established an expanded access program (EAP) for EGFR Exon 20 insertion patients in the U.S. who may be eligible to obtain access to amivantamab during review of the BLA. For information about Janssen’s pre-approval access program, visit <a href=""https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-use-pre-approval-access"">https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-use-pre-approval-access</a></em><em>. We cannot disclose patient enrollment numbers for the EAP.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><em> </em><strong>Has Janssen started any HCP awareness, HCP education, and patient support and awareness programs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kiran:</strong><em> We recently launched a website, </em><em><a href=""https://www.hiddenegfrthreats.com/"">Hidden EGFR Threats</a></em><em>, intended to inform physicians and patients about the multiple threats of EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><em> </em><strong>Is Janssen planning to assess amivantamab in other indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kiran:</strong><em> The results from the CHRYSALIS study have led to new studies to further evaluate the potential of amivantamab and lazertinib combination therapy. The Phase 3 </em><em><a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04487080?term=JNJ-61186372&amp;draw=2"">MARIPOSA</a></em><em> study will compare amivantamab in combination with lazertinib with osimertinib in untreated advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and a Phase 2 trial, </em><em><a href=""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04077463?view=record"">CHRYSALIS-2</a></em><em> is ongoing and enrolling patients who have progressed after treatment with osimertinib and chemotherapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong><em> </em><strong>Any near-future plans to file for EU or any other geographies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kiran:</strong><em> We have plans to pursue approval of amivantamab in other markets with the goal of bringing this novel therapy to patients around the world who may benefit, but it is premature to speculate about timing.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the key highlights of the abstracts presented at ISPOR 2021.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nan Li: </strong><em>At ISPOR 2021, Janssen presented two posters on the economic burden and impact on people living with inherited retinal diseases X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and achromatopsia. These data show, in effect, how much we don’t know about the many challenges faced by patients with early-onset</em> and progressive vision loss due to XLRP, and with reduced visual acuity and photo aversion<em> brought on by achromatopsia.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>For example, we couldn’t identify any studies of the humanistic or economic burden of the XLRP form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). We learned that the progressive trajectory of RP, in general, led people to report feelings of loss, isolation, and fear, loss of vision-related hobbies and pastimes, productivity loss, and loss of social support.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>With achromatopsia, the qualitative studies and patient testimonies we analyzed showed a lifelong negative impact on education, employment opportunities, the ability to carry out daily activities, and travel. That said, quantitative studies of the impact of achromatopsia on patients’ quality of life and on society are lacking. &nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why these studies are a call-to-action to the scientific community for more research on inherited retinal diseases and the individuals impacted by them.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nan Li: </strong><em>The identification of this gap in research is an important first step in assessing how best to support people with these conditions. The therapies currently in development are crucial, but we also need to know the myriad ways that they can improve the lives of patients and families. &nbsp;<br><br>We must recognize that there is so much more to uncover and know about these conditions and the people living with them. Right now, we’re working with patient advocacy groups to generate more evidence about the cost-of-illness and looking closely at patient and caregiver well-being, including the emotional burden of disease. For example, last year we partnered with Retina International on a <a href=""https://retina-kyc.org/research/cost-of-illness/cost-of-illness-uscan/"">study</a></em><em> to estimate the societal disease burden and economic impact of inherited retinal diseases in the U.S. and Canada.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As we look ahead, our Janssen team anticipates initiating more research on these topics hand-in-hand with our stakeholders and partners. &nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Put some colors on XLRP and achromatopsia.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nan Li: </strong><em>Both XLRP and achromatopsia are very rare inherited retinal diseases with an astounding unmet need. Currently there are no approved treatments for either disease, which is devastating for patients and their families.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>XLRP is a genetic&nbsp;disease&nbsp;that causes progressive vision loss, which impacts an estimated one in 40,000 people. The first symptoms typically appear in adolescence, beginning with night blindness, followed by loss of peripheral vision and continuing constriction of the field of vision. It is most common in&nbsp;men because of the way the genes are passed down, and most patients are legally blind by age 40.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Achromatopsia is also a genetic disease. It affects an estimated one in 30,000 people, and results in loss of function in the eye’s cone photoreceptors. People born with achromatopsia have multiple vision problems, including painful light sensitivity, poor visual acuity, absence of color vision and involuntary eye movement called nystagmus. Nystagmus often develops within the first several weeks of life and is commonly the first symptom noted by parents or pediatricians.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are Janssen’s efforts to reduce the economic burden of these two inherited retinal diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nan Li: </strong><em>Janssen strives to make a difference by discovering and developing transformational therapies that have an unequivocal advantage over current standard of care, and by seeking earlier interventions in disease management that will impact quality of life for patients.</em> &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What were the conclusions that have been drawn from the studies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nan Li: </strong><em>From our analysis, it’s clear that so few studies of XLRP exist that conclusions can only be inferred from studies of the wider RP population. Those studies suggest that the earlier onset and progressive vision loss in XLRP may create a greater burden for patients and their caregivers than for RP. There is a dire need for more research.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In terms of achromatopsia, the current literature describes a significant impact of achromatopsia on those affected, but evidence of underdiagnosis suggests the societal burden may be more extensive than is recognized. Much more study is needed to understand and quantify the economic and humanistic burden more fully.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why is there a need to assess the burden of these retinal diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nan Li: </strong><em>Unfortunately, we continue to see very limited data on both XLRP and achromatopsia. As we look ahead, we need more real-world data in the inherited retinal disease space to underscore the need for these therapies and to highlight their potential to dramatically improve the lives of patients and caregivers. If researchers, regulators, and advocacy groups don't understand the vast need for these diseases, they may not truly realize the groundbreaking nature of potential treatments.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the different gene therapies currently in an investigation for XLRP and achromatopsia?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nan Li: </strong><em>At Janssen, our clinical-stage retinal portfolio includes leading product candidates, such as gene therapies, for inherited retinal diseases XLRP and achromatopsia, as well as treatments for more common eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular edema.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is Janssen planning for any collaboration or some license agreements to expand its footprints in this rare field?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nan Li: </strong><em>Janssen is committed to pioneering groundbreaking solutions that offer patients with retinal diseases a brighter future. We plan to bring therapies to patients with unprecedented speed and efficiency in both rare and common eye diseases.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Can we have a glance at Kaia’s partnership with the Chiesi group? How this partnership will improve the QoL of patients living with COPD?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonas:&nbsp;</strong><em>Currently, only very few COPD patients get access to pulmonary rehabilitation, as in many countries the main access to this therapy is via the inpatient setting, which is very limited due to the high costs. In some countries the range of yearly available slots lies somewhere between only 0.5%-1% of all COPD patients. What we try to do is complement the traditional offering with something more scalable, so that more patients can get access to a sustainable way to self-manage their condition.

<p><strong>Noreen</strong>: <em>We presented both pre-clinical and clinical data with KZR-616, our first-in-class selective immunoproteasome inhibitor, during ACR.&nbsp;The presentation by Dr. Furie includes additional patient-weeks of safety and tolerability data compared to prior data presentations for our MISSION Phase 1b study in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with and without nephritis. Encouraging trends in early efficacy signals continue, including improvement of SLE-specific disease activity scores&nbsp;and improvements in renal function and serum biomarkers in 2 of 2 patients with LN enrolled to the Phase 1b portion of the study. No new safety signals have been observed, and KZR-616 administered subcutaneously (SC) once weekly has been consistently well tolerated for 13 weeks. KZR-616 has been studied at doses of 45 mg, 60 mg, and 75 mg SC weekly. We previously identified 45 mg and 60 mg as likely therapeutic doses to advance in our clinical development program.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In a well-accepted preclinical mouse model of myositis, KZR-616 treatment was associated with significant improvement in muscle function and reduced levels of muscle tissue damage. It is also demonstrated that active immunoproteasome is necessary for the disease to occur. These data suggest that selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome with KZR-616 could have a meaningful clinical impact in patients with inflammatory myopathies, such as dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM). We are actively enrolling the PRESIDIO Phase 2 study (NCT04033926), a placebo-controlled, cross-over study of patients with DM and PM.

<p><strong>Tuba: How KZR-616 work to harmonize the immune system?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Noreen</strong>: <em>Playing a critical role in the body's immune system, the immunoproteasome is abundantly expressed in immune cells and acts as a master regulator of cellular function by degrading intracellular proteins. Selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome with KZR-616 has the potential to reduce inflammation by targeting dysfunctional immune cells involved in autoimmunity –, such as T -cells and B -cells –, without causing widespread immunosuppression in patients.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In doing so, KZR-616 has the potential to affect multiple drivers of immune-mediated diseases and harmonize the body's immune system by restoring the immune response – almost like hitting the reset button on one’s immune system.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you planning to explore the potential of KZR-616 beyond autoimmune disorders?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Noreen</strong>: <em>Currently, we are focused on the autoimmune disorders of lupus nephritis, dermatomyositis, and polymyositis; however, we believe that there is strong scientific rationale to pursue KZR-616 for the treatment of a wide array of immune-mediated diseases and may do so in the future.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When can we expect the results of the P-II portion of the MISSION study evaluating KZR-616 in patients with LN?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Noreen</strong>:<em> We expect interim data towards the end of 2021 for the MISSION Phase 2.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are Kezar’s other programs in a pipeline to help patients overcome their disease and live a better life?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Noreen</strong>: <em>We are pioneering research and discovery efforts targeting protein secretion pathways as potential therapies for oncology and immuno-oncology indications.&nbsp;We intend to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for our first clinical candidate from this platform&nbsp;next year&nbsp;where we plan to target a number of difficult to treat solid tumors.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When can we expect the results of P-II PRESIDIO &amp; an OLE study?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Noreen</strong>: <em>We expect top-line data from the PRESIDIO study in the first half of 2022 and the results from the open-label study would be available approximately 1 year later.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What would be the targeted geographies for seeking approval of KZR-616?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Noreen</strong>: <em>Autoimmune diseases have different prevalences across the globe, and our&nbsp;goal is to make this treatment available to as many people as possible and would intend to have a global registration plan but anticipate initially pursuing an FDA approval in the U.S.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you looking for any collaborations for the launch of KZR-616?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Noreen</strong>: <em>While this program does lend itself to potential collaboration based on its broad applicability in a wide array of immune-mediated diseases, we currently have the resources to develop KZR-616 on our own.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is Kezar planning to develop a digital solution for immune-mediated diseases?</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Briefly give an overview of the novel mechanism of DKN-01?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: <em>DKK1 is a secreted protein that modulates cell signaling pathways known as the Wnt signaling pathways, as well as the PI3 kinase and AKT pathway. In cancer, DKK1 has been implicated in facilitating tumor growth and metastasis, as well as promoting immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment through the activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and the suppression of natural killer cell anti-tumor activity. In addition, some patients’ tumors have mutations in their Wnt signaling pathways that lead to higher levels of DKK1 being produced by the tumor cells.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are developing an antibody that binds and inhibits the activity of DKK1 known as DKN-01. We have evaluated DKN-01 in a variety of preclinical and clinical studies.

<p><strong>Ying Huang: </strong><em>Cilta-cel has the potential to be a transformative treatment option for patients living with R/R MM. </em><em>Patients with R/R MM have received previous lines of treatment and yet their disease has returned, is non-responsive or is still progressing. Patients who have received prior therapies, including proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) and anti-CD38 therapies, have poor prognoses and few treatment options. Data from the CARTITUDE-1 study showed a very high overall response rate (ORR) that deepened over time, with 97 percent of patients achieving a response and 67 percent of patients achieving a stringent complete response (sCR) at a median follow-up of 12.4 months with a manageable safety profile.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Briefly discuss Multiple Myeloma. What is the cause and how does it work in the body?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ying Huang: </strong><em>Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterized by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells. Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse. Relapsed myeloma is when the disease has returned after a period of initial, partial, or complete remission and does not meet the definition of being refractory. Refractory multiple myeloma is when a patient’s disease is non-responsive or progresses within 60 days of their last therapy. While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms until later stages of the disease, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems, or infections. Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including protease inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and few treatment options.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em> Our foundational patent filings (</em><a href=""https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2016040499A1/""><em>here</em></a><em>) have a very detailed explanation of the original version of the technology, although it has come a long way since that 2014 filing. We’re getting better at sharing our work with the broader world, starting with a couple of public presentations earlier this year and an improved website—not to mention conversations like this one! In early 2021 we aim to publish at least 3 significant peer-reviewed papers that will draw back the curtain a lot more.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: a. Explain how Lumen’s plant-based manufacturing works…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em>&nbsp;A virtue of our system is its extreme simplicity—in our view an underrated virtue in our industry, and the thing that makes our products so much more rapidly scalable and inexpensive than traditional technologies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Lumen’s large-scale cGMP manufacturing facility has been operating since 2018 and is illustrated in the flow diagram at right. Production runs are initiated by filling the open-topped photobioreactors with city water mixed with just a few mineral salts—photosynthetic cells need very little to flourish. The photobioreactors are illuminated by high-intensity LED lights, which provide the energy for cell growth. CO2 is sparged to maintain pH within operating parameters, and air is sparged to prevent settling.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Optimizing the geometry of the bioreactor frame was a matter of considerable complexity, so that was a significant effort a couple of years ago. But now that we have that optimized design, they are extremely simple to build and operate, in particular, because we use disposable plastic bags to simplify cleaning between production campaigns. Importantly, because spirulina is so robust and the products are intended for oral consumption, sterility is not required for safety. This fact alone makes their operation dramatically cheaper than traditional batch fermentation systems.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Partial harvests are carried out periodically for transfer to downstream processing, and the remaining culture is re-diluted with fresh media. True continuous production like this makes exponential growth possible, enabling Lumen to rapidly scale up drug supply in response to emergencies like Covid-19.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Downstream processing for most products consists of simple de-watering and spray-drying of whole biomass. For Lumen’s initial passive vaccines for enteric targets, the drug product was whole, spray-dried spirulina biomass containing the therapeutic biologic agent.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: b. … and how the company is deploying this to treat the GI element of COVID-19</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em> Lumen has developed an antibody cocktail to prevent or reduce the severity of Covid-19 and reduce viral shedding. The Army Medical Research and Development Command (AMRDC) and the Gates Foundation seed-funded the initial development.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This antibody cocktail is being finalized now for planned spring Phase 2/3 clinical trials, and it</em>'s<em> in vitro performance equals or beats all of the viral neutralization metrics previously published by other groups. The antibody proteins have been further optimized for rapid, low-cost manufacturability and a high degree of stability both on the shelf and in the G.I. tract—this fully rounded optimization for real-world impact sets it apart from others that have been published.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What inspired you to focus specifically on GI symptoms of COVID-19?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em>&nbsp;Although Covid-19 is most notorious for its pulmonary symptoms, the now-famous ACE2 receptor is also expressed at very high levels in epithelial cells of the G.I. tract. So it is not surprising that the GI manifestations of the disease can be quite severe, contributing to ARDS, liver failure, and, in some patients, requiring intestinal resection (here are links to just a </em><a href=""https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020201908""><em>couple</em></a><em> of </em><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2020.03.001""><em>papers</em></a><em> on that).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>There is also an emerging consensus that </em><a href=""https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1494/5920983""><em>fecal-oral transmission</em></a><em> is likely an important factor in the so-called “<a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/6dd451ce-e2b7-470f-bf9a-a215ccf6c10f"">superspreader</a>” events. One recent paper demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can continue replicating for </em><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.03.367391""><em>at least 3 months in the GI tracts of some patients</em></a><em>, which may be contributing to the “long Covid” phenomenon that some patients suffer through. Intuitively, this is easy to understand: norovirus is another well-known virus that infects the human G.I. tract, and—like Covid-19—it is notorious for causing outbreaks in nursing homes, cruise ships, and military vessels.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Most importantly, absolutely no other groups are working on this key aspect of the disease. So, given the obvious utility of our technology platform, we feel an obligation to do whatever we can.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How genetically engineering spirulina can help scale, speed up and reduce the cost of biologic drug development and manufacturing?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em>&nbsp;Developing, testing, and manufacturing traditional injection biologics is horrifically expensive and time-consuming, in part due to the inherent risks of injecting non-natural proteins into the bloodstream.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By contrast, Lumen has intentionally built its entire product development environment to be simple and intrinsically safe. This starts with the fact that spirulina itself has a 50-year safety record in the US (hundreds of years in traditional societies). In addition, mucosally delivered biologic drugs are inherently safer than their injected counterparts because they generally don’t reach systemic circulation, which dramatically lowers the risk of off-target effects or toxicity. And just compare our manufacturing system (simple salt water in an open photobioreactor) to the space-age technologies, bunny-suit sterility, and exotic media components used to manufacture traditional CHO antibody drugs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This relentless war against complexity accelerates timelines and dramatically lowers the cost of developing and making new branded pharmaceuticals—it’s something we’re very passionate about.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How Lumen’s technology aid in meeting the current demand for vaccines in the pandemic?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em>&nbsp;The accomplishments of companies like BioNTech/Pfizer and Regeneron this year are incredible. And I mean that literally: if we had described those completed timelines achievement to an industry pundit 18 months ago, they would not believe it.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>And yet, the pandemic is still with us, and will likely drag on through 2021. The lingering challenges that impede broader, faster adoption of those products highlight some advantages of Lumen’s technology. For example, Regeneron’s product—a traditional injection monoclonal antibody drug—is extremely difficult to manufacture in the quantities demanded. It must be administered by IV, which makes distribution cumbersome, and must be shipped in refrigerated conditions, which is easy for the US and Europe but a huge challenge in Africa and India. The BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is available in greater quantities, but the -80°C storage/distribution challenge is particularly acute, especially outside the US and Europe. Among other lessons, the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us that we cannot afford to be indifferent to epidemics in other countries, so this isn’t just about being charitable.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By contrast, Lumen’s products are shelf-stable and far easier and cheaper to manufacture in enormous quantities. We believe that the mucosal delivery modality (rather than injection) and simplicity will also expedite clinical development without compromising safety. The simpler, safer development path should also enable even faster response times in the next pandemic for less than the billions of dollars devoted to traditional technologies through Operation Warp Speed.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our technology is not the solution to all the world’s problems; no single technology platform can be. But it seems clear that the Lumen platform’s advantages—development speed, manufacturing scalability, shelf stability, and affordability—make it a useful and complementary new tool for this and future pandemics.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we have a discussion on Lumen’s pipeline products?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em>&nbsp;Lumen currently has 4 publicly disclosed programs: Covid-19, C.&nbsp;difficile infection, norovirus infection, and traveler’s diarrhea. They’re all extremely widespread infectious diseases of the G.I. tract.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Infectious diseases (IDs) are not the darling of investors—far from it—but despite that conventional wisdom, we believe that these are enormous commercial opportunities. In the past, investors in ID companies were limited to one of two traditional technologies: antibiotics and vaccines. For reasons that have been exhaustively researched by many groups including the WHO, PATH, and the Wellcome Trust, new product development in both of these areas is afflicted by severe market failure.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our products bear much more of a resemblance to the infectious disease business model that Gilead has successfully pursued for years: selling treatments and preventatives for widespread infectious diseases that lack alternatives and for which repeat dosing is required. There is enormous pent-up demand for a solution to these pervasive diseases, but there hasn’t been a scalable technology solution until now—traditional drug development technologies have failed over and over again. Lumen’s technology just happens to be exactly the right tool for the job.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the future targeted indications for which Lumen is planning to develop affordable biologic drugs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em>&nbsp;It would be premature to share more at this time (and in some cases we’re constrained by confidentiality agreements), but when you consider that our platform allows for the delivery of arbitrarily large amounts of biologic drug, often in cocktail formulation to topical targets (G.I. mucosa, upper airway mucosa, skin, etc.), it’s apparent that there’s an enormous amount of unmet medical need out there for which our technology could help address.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Some examples might include autoimmune diseases of the GI tract (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac, etc.), metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes and other imbalances), diseases involving enzyme deficiencies (e.g., hyperketonuria, hepatic encephalopathy, etc.), and infectious diseases that infect via the upper airways (e.g., pandemic influenza).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Put some light on the grant that Lumen received from the US Army Medical Research and Development Command?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em>&nbsp;See Q2b and Q3 above.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Army’s stated goals are to (1)&nbsp;initiate Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trials by spring 2021, and (2)&nbsp;be in position for mass-scale cGMP manufacturing of the resulting product by summer 2021 (assuming FDA approval; in our view “mass-scale” means 1-3 billion doses/year capacity). The project is on schedule and on budget.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong> Tuba: Would like to share anything specific about your company with our subscribers/readers?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em>&nbsp;We’re hiring as fast as we can, and Seattle is a beautiful city that’s a wonderful place to live! Here’s a photo of some of the R&amp;D team on the deck just outside our lab—the Fremont neighborhood on Lake Union is a wonderful place to work.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you planning for collaboration or looking for funding opportunities in near future?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> <em>&nbsp;We are not currently fundraising, and we continue to enjoy strong support from our VC investors.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are, however, quite interested in building more relationships with other companies in the industry—particularly those with deep domain expertise in the disease areas I highlighted in Q7 above, and companies that have institutional capabilities complementary to our own (particularly late-stage clinical development and international distribution).</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Marc:</strong> <em>&nbsp;We believe that effective interventions must be community centered.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we have a glance at different programs that ViiV is working on for serving the HIV community?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Marc:</strong> <em>&nbsp;</em><em>We recognize that not everyone living with HIV shares the same experiences, so we tailor our programs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In February we released a report, <a href=""https://viivhealthcare.com/content/dam/cf-viiv/viiv-healthcare/en_US/When-We-Feel-Whole-Lessons-and-Learnings-from-the-accelerate-Initiative-v1.pdf"">When We Feel Whole</a></em><em>,</em><em> highlighting findings from the first phase of our place-based initiative called accelerate. This report is really a roadmap of how to approach the work through a community-centered lens. The first phase of the accelerate Initiative was focused on Black gay and bisexual men in Baltimore, MD, and Jackson, MS. That same month, we issued a call for proposals to help bring the program to more Black gay men nationally who are disproportionately affected by HIV.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Accelerate&nbsp;was launched in response to two countervailing forces: the promise of the standard of HIV prevention and care and the persistent disparities experienced in Black communities, even more pronounced among gay and bisexual men. When We Feel Whole, reflects upon learnings from the work we did in Baltimore, MD and Jackson, MS to focus on closing the gaps in prevention, treatment and care for Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in two areas hardest hit by HIV—one of the first initiatives of its kind. The report shares lessons learned around 1) designing,activating and sustaining place-based initiatives to address health disparities and innovation; and 2) deploying innovations and disruptions to reduce individual- and community-level stigma. </em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To build on the momentum of the first phase of this program, through our recently announced funding opportunity, we plan to bring </em><em>accelerate to new cities as part of our $20M commitment to scale up resources to support those disproportionately affected by HIV.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What is your geographical focus to provide HIV treatments? Which country needs more attention in providing treatments for HIV?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Marc:</strong> <em>&nbsp;</em><em>ViiV Healthcare is a global pharmaceutical company focused on leaving no person living with HIV behind, regardless of location. So for us, it’s not a question of who needs more but how do we ensure that the standard of care reaches every person living with HIV – regardless of their age or geographic origin.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>It can be easy to make assumptions about where there may be less need, but the reality is the US has one the worst HIV outcomes in the OECD countries. Our US teams are keenly focused on making sure innovation is brought in every approach to people living with HIV in the US. According to a 2019 CDC issue brief, the South now experiences the greatest burden of HIV and deaths of any US region and lags in providing quality HIV prevention services and care. We saw the signs of this geographic disparity in our first year of ViiV Healthcare and established our <a href=""https://viivhealthcare.com/en-us/positive-action-southern-initiative/"">Positive Action Southern Initiative</a></em><em> in 2010.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Give the key highlights of the research finding published in Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Gill:</strong>&nbsp;<em>The paper published by the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, in the journal Pharmaceuticals, contains the first published study illustrating the antiviral activity of compounds belonging to a novel stabilized cathelicidin platform, recently named CLAROMER brand anti-infectives. These compounds are well published for their antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer properties.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>CLAROMER platform compounds are novel oligomers with peptide-like properties called peptidomimetics or more commonly, peptoids. Peptoids possess desirable attributes of both small molecules and peptides but are completely synthetic cationic foldamers.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We showed that several of the CLAROMER antiinfectives were able to directly inactivate Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 - a virus that can cause herpes labialis (cold sores), herpes keratitis, which is a leading cause of ocular blindness, and herpes genitalis (genital herpes).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition, CLAROMER antiinfectives were also shown to be active against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>These CLAROMER compounds have been shown to destroy the virus while it is still outside the cell by disrupting the viral envelope, a membrane that surrounds the virus. Furthermore, we showed that the compounds were well-tolerated by mouth tissues, suggesting they may be useful when applied topically to the lips, for example</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Why do you think there is a need for new antiviral agents?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Gill:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Viral infections are very difficult or impossible to eliminate with standard antiviral treatments since they work by slowing the host’s biology which the virus uses to replicate. Similar to natural antimicrobial peptides, CLAROMER peptoids act directly on the virus, inactivating it and neutralizing its ability to infect a cell.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additionally, there are many viral infections that have no available antiviral treatment. As we have seen from the difficulties in developing antiviral treatments for COVID-19, there is a need for new antiviral drugs in general, and specifically, drugs that can be adapted more readily against emergent new viral strains such as novel strains of SARS-CoV-2. The CLAROMER mechanism of action, membrane disruption, is expected to enable more generalizable and rapid development of antiviral candidates.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are antimicrobial peptides? Do they have the potential to treat viral infections?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Gill:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) consist of a broad range of naturally occurring compounds that form part of the innate host-defense system. They can be characterized as either linear cationic amphipathic peptides or macrocyclic peptides and consist of many different classes including defensins, cyclotides, and cathelicidins, etc.. Antiviral peptides are a subset of AMPs that have been shown to have antiviral</em> <em>activity and can be found in all species, including plants, arthropods, marine animals, and mammals, for example.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The CLAROMER antiinfective platform is based on the natural human cathelicidin, LL-37. LL-37 is primarily deployed by macrophages and leukocytes but is also produced in epithelial tissues as the first line of defense against infection. LL-37 selectively targets and destroys invading pathogens before they get a chance to infect cells and colonize tissues. It plays an important role in preventing infections, and primarily works in a well-studied</em> mechanism of action - disrupting and destroying microbial and viral membranes. However, LL-37 and other antimicrobial peptides have very short half-lives<em> in vivo which has historically complicated attempts to make them available in the clinic.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The CLAROMER compounds have been designed to mimic the antimicrobial and antiviral properties of LL-37 in a stabilized small molecule structure. These completely synthetic peptide-mimics of LL-37 are stable in vivo but otherwise behave similarly to LL-37. Thus we believe they are excellent candidates for development as antiviral or virucidal drugs for a broad range of viruses.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss in-depth biomimetic antiviral peptoids. Also, put some light on its effectiveness on HSV-1 &amp; SARS-CoV-2 infections.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Gill:</strong>&nbsp;<em>CLAROMER brand peptoids are nonpeptide mimics of cathelicidin peptides, peptidomimetics. Like peptides, they form what is known as an amphipathic structure, where one side of the peptide is hydrophobic, while the other is hydrophilic and cationic. Together, this structure allows them to attach to the negatively charged phospholipids of microbial membranes, and disrupt membrane coherence, rapidly leading to viral inactivation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>While a peptide is a polymer of amino acids, CLAROMER anti-infectives (peptoids)&nbsp; are polymers based on oligo-N-substituted glycine back-bones designed to mimic peptides and proteins. Structurally, instead of the functional group attached to the central carbon, as in standard amino acids, the monomers of these fully synthetic peptoids have the functional group attached to the nitrogen of the amino group. This means that the peptoids still have the desired chemical characteristics of the peptide upon which they were designed, but are not able to be cleaved by protease enzymes that would otherwise break natural amino acid peptide bonds.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>However, similar to human cathelicidin peptide, LL-37, antimicrobial peptoids selectively bind microbial and viral membranes with comparable speed and efficiency and neutralize the pathogen. This allows these particular peptoids to inactivate many types of pathogens, even very structurally different viruses, such as HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The only major similarity between the two viruses is that they both are enveloped by a viral membrane. Based on our initial results, we observe that the peptoids selectively bind to the viral envelope (avoiding the host cell), and break the viral envelope apart, thus directly neutralizing the virus</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we have a glance at Maxwell’s Development programs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Joshua:</strong> <em>The CLAROMER platform is capable of stable biomimicry of many types of peptides. Our pipeline is currently developing cathelicidin-like product candidates designed to selectively treat several types of herpes topical and viral lung infections in which the medical need is not currently met. We plan to interact with the FDA at a pre-IND meeting for our first product in 2022.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Put some light on the term “Zero-Day Therapeutics”.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Joshua:</strong> <em>Over a decade of published studies show that CLAROMER brand anti-infective peptoids appear to mimic the broad-spectrum nature of natural cathelicidins. Humanity needs safe, easy to produce therapeutics for emerging, novel viral threats. This platform has the potential to produce broadly applicable therapeutics that may be effective against an emergent viral threat on “day zero” of an outbreak.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How are Maxwell’s CLAROMER peptoids different from the other antiviral therapies available in the market?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Joshua:</strong> <em>Current antiviral products work by slowing the host’s biology which the virus uses to replicate. They do not kill the virus or prevent the virus from infecting a cell. In contrast, the CLAROMER antiviral compounds work directly on the viral envelope, causing inactivation of the virus and preventing the virus from infecting the host cells. There is also evidence that CLAROMER antivirals bind with viral DNA and proteins further disrupting viral mechanisms. Indeed, the different mechanisms of action mean that the presence of both existing antivirals and CLAROMER antiinfectives in the market has the potential for synergy and not just competition.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you planning to mimic the potential of peptides in other viral infections?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Joshua:</strong> Maxwell is collaborating with scientists and institutions around the world targeting formerly untreatable viruses with product candidates that appear well-tolerated in the infected tissues. We have some exciting findings but are unable to discuss those just yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Share the growth of Maxwell Biosciences (their work, achievements, collaborations, latest funding) with our readers.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Joshua:</strong> <em>Maxwell’s scientific co-founder, Annelise Barron, recently won the NIH Pioneer Award which comes with millions in grant funds. While Maxwell benefits from over $30 million in grants, the company has only recently begun raising money from investors. A well-known pharmaceutical industry CEO and investor, David Evans Shaw, recently became a major investor and is introducing our executives to venture capitalists and mentors accustomed to financing the launch of early-stage biotech companies</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Unveils the design of P-II/III study evaluating plant-based vaccine.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nathalie: </strong><em>The Phase 2/3 study is a multi-portion design to confirm that the chosen formulation and dosing regimen of CoVLP (two doses of 3.75 µg CoVLP combined with GSK's pandemic adjuvant given 21 days apart) has acceptable immunogenicity and safety profile in healthy adults 18-64 years of age, elderly subjects aged 65 and over and adults with comorbidities.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Phase 2 portion of the trial was a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the adjuvanted recombinant COVID-19 plant-derived vaccine candidate in subjects aged 18 and above. It was conducted in multiples sites in Canada and the United States in a population composed of healthy adults (18-64y), elderly adults (over 65y), and adults with comorbidities. Each age group enrolled up to 306 subjects randomized 5:1 to receive the adjuvanted CoVLP vaccine candidate: placebo and with 2:1 stratification in older adults (65-74 and =75). All subjects will be followed for a period of 12 months after the last vaccination for the assessment of safety and durability of the immune responses to the vaccine candidate, which will be the final analysis.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Phase 3 portion is an event-driven, randomized, observer-blinded, crossover placebo-controlled design that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the CoVLP formulation, compared to placebo, in up to 30,000 subjects in North America, Latin America, and Europe and within the same populations.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Highlight the contributions of GSK in this collaboration for adjuvanted plant based COVID-19 vaccine?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nathalie: </strong><em>The use of an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation, as it can reduce the amount of antigen required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and made available to more people. GSK’s pandemic adjuvant is an oil-in-water emulsion combining several ingredients that have been carefully selected to stimulate the immune system, it has been used successfully in pandemic flu vaccines in the past.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we have a discussion on the efficacy rate &amp; safety of this plant-based vaccine of Covid-19?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nathalie: </strong><em>Medicago is currently testing the vaccine for&nbsp;</em><em>safety and efficacy in its Phase 3 trials.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Continuous efforts are still ongoing to produce an efficient vaccine for COVID 19, owing to its great potentials, in this scenario how can plant-based vaccine leave its mark on the world?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nathalie: </strong><em>Medicago uses a unique plant-based platform to produce its therapeutics. Potential benefits of Medicago’s plant-based technology include:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Rapid – Ability to deliver research-grade</em> vaccines doses in 19 days and clinical-grade<em> in 6-8 weeks.</em></li><li><em>Accurate - Designed to accurately match the recommended target strains.</em></li><li><em>Versatile - Ability to produce both vaccines and antibodies with the same platform.</em></li><li><em>Scalable - Ease of scale-up, one plant or 10,000 plants require the same growth conditions.</em></li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Highlight the key features of novel plant based COVID vaccine? Are conventional methods have been applied for developing the vaccine?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nathalie: </strong><em>The company uses proprietary plant-based technology to develop protein-based therapeutics. Unlike traditional vaccination development, Medicago does not use animal products or live viruses to create its products. Instead, it uses Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) that mimic the shape and dimensions of a virus, which allows the body to recognize them and create an immune response in a non-infectious way.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:  How it will be a revolutionary treatment for patients as this will be the world’s first plant-based vaccine?</strong><br><br><strong>Nathalie: </strong><em>Plants are highly efficient at producing proteins of varying complexity, serving as bioreactors – or mini-factories – for our vaccines and protein-based therapeutics. Medicago's plant-based production platform demonstrates agility, accuracy, and speed by limiting the risk of undesirable mutations (no use of live viruses) and contamination during production, and significantly shortening production timelines</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;When can we expect the availability of this vaccine?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nathalie: </strong><em>Medicago is working hard with the objective to submit a COVID-19 vaccine to health authorities for regulatory reviews as soon as possible. We expect to complete Phase 2/3 clinical trials by summer 2021. Regulatory submission to Health Canada and the FDA would follow successful clinical trials.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the Medicenna Superkine Platform? Highlights its key features.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Fahar:</strong><em> On a high level, Medicenna’s platform enables the transformation of natural interleukins into Superkines, which are enhanced compared to their natural counterparts. For example, Superkines can be designed to reverse immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, deliver cell-killing agents without harming healthy cells, or turn off destructive autoimmune processes.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To enable their transformation, interleukins are engineered through directed evolution, where subtle changes are made to enhance their desired properties. This allows us to create a library of tunable Superkines, which as we just mentioned, are engineered to address the underlying mechanisms of the disease by selectively binding to certain receptor sub-types while avoiding others.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>From this initial library, we then further design the selected Superkines via protein fusion, to enhance certain characteristics — such as improving pharmacodynamics and safety or optimizing their half-life to limit dosing issues — or to add new functions, such as the ability to deliver a payload of a cell-killing toxin specifically to cancer cells.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Superkine platform gives us a lot of versatility with which to work, whether it is through picking an agonist or antagonist or eliciting a particular response when the molecule binds to its corresponding receptor.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Medicenna focuses on creating its Superkines from three major families of interleukins: IL-2, IL-4, and IL-13. These three families are known to modulate immune activity in 2000 different diseases.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss your robust pipeline of Interleukins? Also, shed light on next-generation Superkines.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Fahar:</strong><em> We have active research and preclinical pipeline, which speaks to the versatility of Medicenna’s Superkine platform, for a variety of tumor types and even autoimmune diseases.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>MDNA55 is our most advanced program which targets recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM). This molecule exploits the overexpression of the IL-4 receptor on the tumor surface and uses an IL-4 Superkine to deliver a tumor-killing payload specifically to tumor cells. To date, we have studied MDNA55 in 118 patients with rGBM, and reported compelling data demonstrating its superior efficacy and safety compared to the current standard of care. Median survival after just one treatment of MDNA55 was 14 months, with 20% of patients surviving more than 24 months, versus a 6–9-month median survival and 2% of patients surviving past 24 months with the current standard of care. MDNA55 has both fast-track and orphan drug status from the FDA and in September 2020 the FDA agreed for Medicenna to conduct an innovative open-label hybrid Phase 3 trial that allows the use of a substantial number of patients (two-thirds) from a matched external control arm to support regulatory approval of MDNA55 for rGBM. This hybrid trial design will reduce the overall number of subjects needed to enroll in the study to achieve the primary endpoint as well as reduce costs and timelines associated with the study. We are currently pursuing a strategic partnership to assist with the future clinical development of MDNA55.  </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>MDNA11 is an IL-2 Superkine that is designed to overcome the shortcomings of the currently approved IL-2 therapy as well as improve upon competing programs in development. What differentiates MDNA11 is its impressive ability to selectively target the IL2Rß receptor to preferentially activate anti-cancer effector immune cells rather than toxic and pro-tumor regulatory T cells (Tregs). Additionally, this Superkine has been fused with recombinant human albumin, which facilitates further improvements over the currently approved IL-2 therapy, as it extends the half-life of the molecule by up to 24 hours and allows it to accumulate at the tumor site for effective localization.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>MDNA209 is similar to our MDNA11 molecule, except that it is a super-antagonist calming the immune system whereas MDNA11 is a super-agonist that activates the immune system. This molecule has potential applications for autoimmune diseases where the body has an over-active immune system and produces aberrant T-cell responses. MDNA209 is currently in preclinical development.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our pre-clinical asset, MDNA19-MDNA413 is from the Bifunctional Superkine Immunotherapies platform (BiSKITs) platform and was the subject of our recent AACR data. These are discussed in more detail below.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The variety of protein therapies with which we can fuse our Superkines to create novel BiSKITs opens the possibility of a deep pipeline of fusion molecules internally or in collaboration with other pharma companies. In addition to generating anti-body Superkine fusions or trifunctional. Superkines, we can also arm cell-based therapies and tumor-killing viruses with Superkines.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are bispecific Superkines? How do they “warm up” cold tumors?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Fahar:</strong><em> Bispecific or Bifunctional Superkines, which Medicenna dubs as BiSKITs, are fusions of two Superkines, or a Superkine fused with an antibody such as a checkpoint inhibitor or a T-cell engager. The two ends of the molecule act synergistically to target a tumor based on the needs of cancer we aim to address.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>An issue with checkpoint inhibitors is that they are unable to treat immunologically cold tumors because these tumors have been hidden from the immune system by the immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Interleukins are cell signaling molecules, and Superkines build upon that role to find and bind receptors on cold tumors to unblind them to the immune system.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Possible mechanisms to warm up cold tumors include binding to the Type 2 IL4 receptor (IL4R? + IL13R?1) to block STAT6 signaling, which weakens the tumor’s defenses by blocking the function of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Another approach is to specifically target the IL13R?2, a decoy receptor that is over-expressed on many tumors, and deliver a fusion Superkine or T-cell engager for the immune system to attack.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Fahar:</strong><em> The key highlights of the poster for MDNA19-MDNA413 are as follows:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""type"":""I""} -->
<ol type=""I""><li><em>The molecule showed enhanced signaling in cancer-killing effector T cells and NK cells, and reduced activation of pro-tumor Treg cells corresponding to a 209-fold and 90-fold enhancement in CD8/Treg and NK/Treg ratios, respectively, when compared to native IL-2.</em></li><li><em>MDNA19-MDNA413 selectively binds and inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling via IL13Ra1, which is normally associated with pro-tumoral effects due to stimulation of MDSCs and M2a polarization of TAMs. There are two receptors which the MDNA419 portion can target: IL13Ra1 and IL13Ra2. IL13Ra1 is the receptor that the molecule needs to target to elicit an effect, and MDNA19-MDNA413 is ~240 times more selective for IL13Ra1 when compared to native IL-13.</em></li><li><em>MDNA19-MDNA413 potently inhibited IL-4- and IL-13-mediated pSTAT6 activity with an IC50 of 8.0 and 12.3 nM, respectively.</em></li><li><em>MDNA19-MDNA413 effectively inhibited IL-13-induced polarization of pro-tumor M2a macrophages.</em></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the mechanism of action of MDNA19 and MDNA413?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Fahar:</strong><em> The MDNA19-MDNA413 BiSKIT seeks to achieve two objectives: Block the pro-tumoral action of IL-4 and IL-13 on cells of the TME and, at the same time, activate CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells to attack the tumor.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The MDNA413 portion binds to the dual IL4R?/IL-13R?1 receptor on TME cells, which inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT6. This disrupts downstream signaling and, ultimately, inhibits the M2a polarization of TAMs, and prevents the MDSCs from suppressing T cell function. This effectively turns the tumor hot.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The MDNA19 portion is highly specific to the IL2Rß, which activates the anti-cancer effector immune cells. Since the MDNA413 end of the molecule has blocked the immunosuppressive effects of the TME, the activated T cells and natural killer cells are better able to act on the tumor.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;When can we expect the initiation of clinical studies of any of your pre-clinical candidates? And in which indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Fahar:</strong><em> We expect to file an application with regulators to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for MDNA11 in mid-2021 for the treatment of solid tumors.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We expect to announce a clinical candidate from our BiSKITs platform later this year for a yet to be determined oncology indication</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you open to collaborations to advance your pipeline?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Fahar:</strong><em> Yes. We are currently seeking a partner to complete a Phase 3 registration trial for MDNA55 (IL-4 and toxin fusion).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are open to collaborations on our BiSKITs platform with companies that have their own proprietary antibodies, oncolytic viruses, or CAR-T programs, all of which could benefit from one or more of our Superkines.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What motivates the company to work on interleukins? How can you say that it will transform people’s lives?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Fahar:</strong><em> For a very long time, the interleukin therapy field had not seen any meaningful advancements. Of course, there was an approved interleukin therapy (Proleukin), but it was highly toxic and is reserved for when all else has failed.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>However, as the industry shifted towards finding more innovative means to treat tumors, interleukins – once again – resurfaced, but this time with new ways of harnessing their effects without causing undue toxicities.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Medicenna’s Superkine platform was created with the purpose of realizing the full potential of interleukins not just for cancer, but also in other disease areas as well because we firmly believe that Superkines can form the backbone of a new class of immunotherapies that can address significant unmet needs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>A good example of this is MDNA55 and rGBM. The current standard of care for rGBM is surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. There has been no new standard therapy in decades since this is an incredibly difficult tumor to treat. Because of the engineered interleukin at its core and the mechanism of the therapy, MDNA55 has shown substantial improvements in survival compared to the standard of care.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>With interleukins, and Superkines specifically, we see many more opportunities to revisit the standard of care for many cancers and meet the significant unmet needs of patients who are in desperate need of hope</em>.</p>
