Expected to come online by year end, the “Cambridge-1” supercomputer will be an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ system capable of delivering more than 400 petaflops of AI performance and 8 petaflops of Linpack performance, which would rank it No. 29 on the latest TOP500 list of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. It will also rank among the world’s top 3 most energy-efficient supercomputers on the current Green500 list.

Among the first pharmaceutical companies to harness Cambridge-1 for research will be GSK and AstraZeneca. Additionally, researchers from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, King’s College London and Oxford Nanopore Technologies plan to take advantage of the system.

“Tackling the world’s most pressing challenges in healthcare requires massively powerful computing resources to harness the capabilities of AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, in his GPU Technology Conference keynote. “The Cambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation for the U.K., and further the groundbreaking work being done by the nation’s researchers in critical healthcare and drug discovery.”

NVIDIA has previously announced that it intends to create an AI Center of Excellence in Cambridge, featuring a new Arm-based supercomputer, which will serve as a hub of collaboration for AI researchers, scientists and startups across the U.K. As these plans develop, Cambridge-1 will become a part of that Center of Excellence, which will expand to include further supercomputers, and support more industries across the U.K.

Four Key Focus Areas
The system’s mission is to support and further enable the U.K. ecosystem of healthcare and life science researchers, which has become an epicenter for transformative healthcare research and discovery. Its four key focus areas will be:

Joint industry research — Solving large-scale healthcare and data-science problems which otherwise could not be tackled due to their size, resulting in improved patient outcomes, increased success rates and decreased overall healthcare costs.
University-granted compute time — Access to NVIDIA GPU time will be donated as a resource to specific studies to contribute to the hunt for cures.
Support AI startups — NVIDIA will provide opportunities to learn — and it will collaborate with startups to nurture the next generation and provide early access to AI tools.
Educate future AI practitioners — The system will serve as a destination for world-class researchers and provide hands-on experiences to the next generation.
Cambridge-1 AI
Cambridge-1 will be the first NVIDIA supercomputer designed and built for external research access. Powered by 80 NVIDIA DGX A100™ systems connected by NVIDIA Mellanox® InfiniBand networking, it will give researchers and academics the ability to tackle some of the most challenging AI training, inference and data science workloads at scale. While traditional supercomputers can take years to deploy, the modular DGX SuperPOD architecture enables the system to be installed and operational in as little as a few weeks. NVIDIA will invest around £40 million ($51.7 million) in Cambridge-1.

NVIDIA Clara for Computational Drug Discovery
NVIDIA will help researchers take advantage of NVIDIA Clara Discovery™, a state-of-the-art suite of tools optimized for NVIDIA DGX™ that brings together the power of imaging, radiology and genomics to develop AI applications for the biggest computational tasks of healthcare.

49864,Novartis Reports Results of Beovu (brolucizumab) in Two New Post-Hoc Analyses of P-III HAWK and HARRIER Studies for Wet AMD,New Phase III analysis demonstrates Novartis Beovu showed improvement in best-corrected visual acuity in wet AMD patients with early persistent fluid,"The P-III HAWK (6/3mg) & HARRIER (6mg) study assessing Beovu [q12w/q8w with the majority on q12w following the loading phase) vs aflibercept (2mg) in 1,800 patients with wet AMD across 400 centers
 Results: first analysis ewer patients had early persistent fluid (12.5% vs 20.4%), defined as the presence of intra-retinal fluid or subretinal fluid through @12wks. treatment, patients gain greater BVCA (6.4 vs.3.7), CST control (80% vs 69%) respectively, presented at EURETINA
 Beovu is the first advanced humanized scFv, approved for clinical use in 40+ countries, including in the US, EU, UK, Japan, Canada, and Australia","Oct 05, 2020
In a post-hoc analysis of HAWK and HARRIER, fewer Beovu (brolucizumab) patients had early persistent fluid (12.5% vs. 20.4% of aflibercept patients), defined as the presence of intra-retinal fluid and/or sub-retinal fluid through week 12 of treatment1
Patients with early persistent fluid treated with Beovu experienced greater gains in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at week 96 versus patients treated with aflibercept (6.4 vs. 3.7 letters, respectively)1
This data, along with nine additional analyses of HAWK and HARRIER presented at EURETINA 2020 virtual congress, further support Beovu as an efficacious treatment option for wet AMD
Basel, October 5, 2020 — Novartis today announced that results of two new post-hoc analyses of the Phase III HAWK and HARRIER clinical trials in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were presented at the EURETINA 2020 virtual congress. The first analysis demonstrated fewer Beovu® (brolucizumab) patients had early persistent fluid, defined as the presence of intra-retinal fluid and/or sub-retinal fluid through week 12 of treatment, compared with aflibercept patients1. For patients who did have early persistent fluid, those treated with Beovu achieved greater best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) gains and greater reductions in central subfield thickness (CST) at week 96 versus those treated with aflibercept1.

A second analysis showed Beovu was associated with better control of retinal fluid, as measured by achievement and maintenance of defined CST levels. In the study, more Beovu patients than aflibercept patients achieved CST control (80% vs. 69% at week 96 at a defined CST threshold of 320 µm, respectively)2. Patients who stayed longer in a controlled CST state had better visual gains compared with those who remained in an uncontrolled CST state2. CST is a key indicator of fluid in the retina, and drying the retina is a core aim of treatment for wet AMD2.

“The data presented at EURETINA suggests Beovu can better help patients who have persistent retinal fluid achieve disease control by reducing CST and improving their vision in the long term,” said Dirk Sauer, Global Head Development, Novartis Pharma Ophthalmology. “These results further strengthen our confidence in Beovu as an effective and important treatment option for wet AMD patients aiming to improve their vision.”

Novartis has nine podium presentations at the congress and is sponsoring a Beovu symposium and an independent medical education program conducted by EURETINA.

New Phase III analysis demonstrates Novartis Beovu® showed improvement in best-corrected visual acuity in wet AMD patients with early persistent fluid

About Beovu (brolucizumab)
Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) is the first advanced humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) approved for clinical use3-5. Single-chain antibody fragments are highly sought after in drug development due to their small size, enhanced tissue penetration, rapid clearance from systemic circulation and drug delivery characteristics5-7.

The proprietary innovative structure results in a small molecule (26 kDa) with potent inhibition of, and high affinity to, all VEGF-A isoforms6. Beovu is engineered to deliver a high concentration of drug, thus providing more active binding agents3-5. In preclinical studies, Beovu inhibited activation of VEGF receptors through prevention of the ligand-receptor interaction6-8. Increased signaling through the VEGF pathway is associated with pathologic ocular angiogenesis and retinal edema9. Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of neovascular lesions and suppress endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability9.

Beovu is approved in more than 40 countries, including in the US10, EU11, UK11, Japan12, Canada13 and Australia14, based on the results of the HAWK and HARRIER clinical trials.

About the HAWK and HARRIER studies
With more than 1,800 patients across nearly 400 centers worldwide, HAWK (NCT02307682) and HARRIER (NCT02434328) are the first global head-to-head trials in patients with wet AMD that prospectively demonstrated efficacy of Beovu at week 48 using an innovative q12w/q8w regimen, with a majority of patients on q12w immediately following the loading phase3,4. Both studies are 96-week prospective, randomized, double-masked multi-center studies and part of the Phase III clinical development of Beovu3,4. The studies were designed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of brolucizumab 6 mg (HAWK and HARRIER) and 3 mg (HAWK only) versus aflibercept 2 mg in patients with wet AMD3,4. The most common adverse events (≥5% of patients) with Beovu were vision blurred, cataract, conjunctival hemorrhage, vitreous floaters and eye pain3,4.

STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SWTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing medicines for patients with severe rare diseases and cancer, today announced that the company has entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) to evaluate SpringWorks Therapeutics’ investigational gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI), nirogacestat, in combination with Pfizer’s anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CD3 bispecific antibody, PF‐06863135, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Gamma secretase inhibition prevents the cleavage and shedding of BCMA from the surface of myeloma cells. In preclinical models, nirogacestat has been shown to increase the cell surface density of BCMA and reduce levels of soluble BCMA, thereby enhancing the activity of BCMA-targeted therapies, including CD3 bispecific antibodies.

“This collaboration is another important step in continuing to advance our goal of developing nirogacestat as a best-in-class BCMA potentiator, and we are pleased to work with Pfizer to study nirogacestat in combination with PF‐06863135, which has recently demonstrated promising monotherapy clinical data,” said Saqib Islam, Chief Executive Officer of SpringWorks Therapeutics. “We now have five collaborations with industry-leading BCMA developers to evaluate nirogacestat in combinations across modalities. We look forward to generating clinical data with our collaborators to further evaluate the ability of nirogacestat to improve outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will sponsor and conduct the Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination, and will assume all costs associated with the study, other than expenses related to the manufacturing of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. Pfizer and SpringWorks Therapeutics will also form a joint development committee to manage the clinical study, which is expected to commence in the first half of 2021.

“Entering into this clinical collaboration is a proud milestone in our strong relationship with SpringWorks,” said Chris Boshoff, MD, PhD, Chief Development Officer for Pfizer Oncology at Pfizer. “We believe that studying nirogacestat in combination with PF-06863135 could hold significant therapeutic promise for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and we look forward to working together to advance this important area of research.”

In addition to its ongoing clinical collaborations with BCMA-directed therapies, SpringWorks is also currently conducting a global Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the DeFi Trial) to evaluate nirogacestat in adults with progressing desmoid tumors.

About Nirogacestat
Nirogacestat is an investigational, oral, selective, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical development for desmoid tumors, which are rare and often debilitating and disfiguring soft-tissue tumors. Gamma secretase cleaves multiple transmembrane protein complexes, including Notch, which is believed to play a role in activating pathways that contribute to desmoid tumor growth.

In addition, gamma secretase has been shown to directly cleave membrane-bound BCMA, resulting in the release of the BCMA extracellular domain, or ECD, from the cell surface. By inhibiting gamma secretase, membrane-bound BCMA can be preserved, increasing target density while reducing levels of soluble BCMA ECD, which may serve as decoy receptors for BCMA-directed therapies. Nirogacestat’s ability to enhance the activity of BCMA-directed therapies has been observed in preclinical models of multiple myeloma. SpringWorks is evaluating nirogacestat as a BCMA potentiator and has five collaborations with industry-leading BCMA developers to evaluate nirogacestat in combinations across modalities, including with an antibody-drug conjugate, two CAR T cell therapies and two bispecific antibodies. In addition, SpringWorks and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have entered into a sponsored research agreement to further characterize the ability of nirogacestat to modulate BCMA and potentiate BCMA directed therapies using a variety of preclinical and patient-derived multiple myeloma models developed by researchers at Fred Hutch.

Nirogacestat has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of desmoid tumors (June 2018) and from the European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (September 2019). The FDA also granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis (November 2018 and August 2019).

About PF‐06863135
PF‐06863135 is an anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CD3 bispecific antibody being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical study to treat relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This bispecific antibody can be administered subcutaneously and has been optimized for binding affinity to both BCMA and CD3, enabling more potent T-cell-mediated tumor cell toxicity.

Safety and Tolerability Similar to Previously Reported Phase 1 Results in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Oct. 5, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) today announced positive topline Phase 2 results from the CodeBreaK 100 clinical study, evaluating sotorasib (proposed INN for AMG 510) in 126 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who had failed a median of two prior lines of anti-cancer therapies (immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy).

Sotorasib demonstrated an objective response rate (primary end point) consistent with previously reported Phase 1 data in patients with advanced NSCLC taking the 960 mg daily dose. Other measures of efficacy, including duration of response, were promising and more than half of the responders were still on treatment and continuing to respond as of the data cutoff date. Safety and tolerability were similar to previously reported data in Phase 1 in patients with advanced NSCLC.

“Targeting KRAS has been a 40-year quest that has left patients with limited options. These topline data underscore our belief in the potential for sotorasib to become the standard of care for non-small cell lung cancer patients with the KRAS G12C mutation who remain in need of new treatment options,” said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “We now have more than 500 patients who have been enrolled across clinical studies, and we are rapidly moving forward with a broad-based development program, which includes monotherapy studies in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer and other solid tumors harboring the KRAS G12C mutation, as well as a suite of combination studies. We look forward to discussing the current results with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies, to determine the best path forward for sotorasib as a potential treatment for patients with NSCLC harboring the KRAS G12C mutation.”

Detailed results of this potentially registrational Phase 2 clinical study in patients with advanced NSCLC will be submitted to the IASLC 2020 World Congress on Lung Cancer taking place January 2021. A global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled confirmatory study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC patients (CodeBreaK 200) has begun recruiting.

About KRAS
The RAS gene family, which has been the subject of almost four decades of research, contains some of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers.1,2 Targeting the KRAS protein, the most commonly altered family member in solid tumors, has been one of the toughest challenges in cancer research.1 A specific mutation known as KRAS G12C, is a major driver of tumor growth, occurring broadly across solid tumor indications. In the U.S., about 13% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer harbor the KRAS G12C mutation.3,4 It is also found in approximately 3-5% of colorectal cancers and 1-2% of numerous other solid tumors, making this among the most broadly represented mutations across cancer patient subgroups.5,6,7,8,9. With the discovery of a unique surface groove in the KRASG12C protein, Amgen developed and advanced the first investigational KRASG12C inhibitor into the clinic and is exploring the potential of KRASG12C inhibition across multiple tumor types for patients who remain in dire need of treatment options.1,10

About CodeBreaK
The CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen’s investigational drug sotorasib is designed to treat patients with an advanced solid tumor with the KRAS G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers. As the most advanced KRAS G12C clinical development program, CodeBreaK has enrolled more than 500 patients across 13 tumor types since its inception.

CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors. Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The study enrolled 126 patients, 123 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline.

Amgen’s single-arm Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer (CRC) (also part of CodeBreaK 100) is fully enrolled and topline results are expected in 2021. A global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled confirmatory study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC patients (CodeBreaK 200) has begun recruiting. Amgen is also enrolling several Phase 1b combination studies across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101).

Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration or potential collaboration in pursuit of therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 (including statements regarding such collaboration’s, or our own, ability to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 or antibodies against targets other than the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, and/or to produce any such antibodies to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19), or the Otezla® (apremilast) acquisition (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.

 Zejula (PO, qc) is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor and has received approval in 2019, in Canada for recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer","MISSISSAUGA, ON, Oct. 5, 2020 /CNW/ – ZEJULA (niraparib) is now approved in Canada for the monotherapy maintenance treatment of female adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapyi.

“Tragically, thousands of women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in Canada this year, and about 2,000 are expected to die,” said Dr. Alex Romanovschi, Country Medical Director, GSK Canada. “ZEJULA represents a significant step forward as GSK is accelerating its oncology pipeline to deliver the next generation of medicines to Canadian patients. As part of GSK’s renewed focus on oncology, we’re proud that ZEJULA is now approved for first-line maintenance therapy, helping address the needs of Canadians living with these cancers earlier.”

Ovarian cancer

Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women worldwideii. In Canada, it is the 5th most common cancer in women, and the most fatal gynecological canceriii. Ovarian cancer is most frequently diagnosed in women aged 55 to 64 years. It is estimated that this year 3,100 Canadian women will be newly diagnosed with this disease, and 1,950 will dieiv.

Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at later stages and follows a highly recurrent disease course with a 5-year survival rate of 29% for patients with advanced diseasev. Despite surgical cytoreduction and response to front-line platinum-based chemotherapy, up to 85% of women with advanced ovarian cancer experience cancer disease recurrence, at which point their disease is considered incurablevi. Maintenance treatments following response to chemotherapy aim to extend the benefit of chemotherapy by delaying time to recurrence and prolonging progression-free survival. As first-line treatment represents a key junction in the management pathway, maintenance therapy in this setting represents an opportunity to improve progression-free survival and maximize cancer remission.

About ZEJULA (niraparib)

ZEJULA is an oral, once-daily poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. The approval of ZEJULA in the first-line setting was based on the results of the phase III PRIMA study (ENGOT-OV26/GOG-3012), which enrolled patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer following a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of biomarker status.

In 2019, ZEJULA received approval in Canada for the maintenance treatment of female adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.

multilang-release
Santhera will hold a conference call today at 13:00 CEST, 12:00 BST, 07:00 EDT. Details are at the end of this statement.

Pratteln, Switzerland, October 6, 2020 – Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) announces the discontinuation of its Phase 3 SIDEROS study with Puldysa® (idebenone) in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are in respiratory decline and receive concomitant glucocorticoid treatment. Data from an interim analysis conducted by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) concluded that the study was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint. As a consequence, Santhera will discontinue the study, withdraw the European marketing authorization application and end the global development program for Puldysa. The Company intends to initiate a restructuring plan for the business with a focus on retaining key functions for bringing DMD drug candidate vamorolone to patients and execute on its other pipeline programs.

Based on the now completed interim analysis which tested for efficacy, the DSMB has recommended the SIDEROS study be discontinued due to futility. The interim analysis was based on the primary endpoint of the study, the change of forced vital capacity % predicted (FVC%p) from baseline to 18 months of treatment. The outcome revealed that the probability of reaching the primary endpoint at the end of the study is too small to merit the continuation of the study. There were no safety concerns noted by the DSMB.

Santhera will stop the SIDEROS trial (including extension) and participants who are enrolled in the study will discontinue study medication and complete the study’s follow-up evaluations. Furthermore, following up on the recommendation from the DSMB, Santhera will discuss the impact of ending the SIDEROS study on ongoing expanded access programs with the corresponding regulatory bodies.

“We would like to thank the patients and the families, as well as investigators and medical professionals, who participated in the SIDEROS study. Without their contributions we would not be able to advance DMD research,” said Dario Eklund, Chief Executive Officer of Santhera. “While this is obviously not the outcome we expected, all our efforts in DMD will now be focused on progressing the promising drug candidate vamorolone which we recently licensed from ReveraGen to its next inflection point, the readout of 6-month topline data from the pivotal VISION-DMD study planned for the second quarter of 2021.”

In connection with this decision, Santhera intends to start a restructuring process, aligning its operations to focus on progressing vamorolone for DMD, lonodelestat for cystic fibrosis and other lung diseases and its discovery-stage gene therapy approach for congenital muscular dystrophy.

Conference Call
Santhera will host a conference call today at 13:00 CEST / 12:00 BST / 07:00 EDT. Dario Eklund, CEO of Santhera, will discuss this update. Participants are invited to call one of the following numbers 10-15 minutes before the conference call starts (no dial-in code is required):

Streamlined workflow with sample prep under two minutes cuts costs, plastic usage and time to result to under one hour
Compatible with standard lab automation equipment, any assay and transport media
October 05, 2020 04:03 PM Eastern Daylight Time
HILDEN, Germany & GERMANTOWN, Md.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–QIAGEN (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) today announced plans to launch a novel straightforward approach to viral RNA epidemiology that will significantly simplify and accelerate PCR analysis and remove key testing bottlenecks for SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses.

QIAGEN’s innovative QIAprep&amp Viral RNA UM Kit combines a liquid-based sample preparation step completed in only two minutes with real-time PCR detection in a streamlined workflow that can be automated with standard lab equipment for any throughput, any assay and any reaction need from single to multiplex testing. The kit, which uses the most common transport media such as Universal Transport Media (UTMTM) as the starting material, includes both sample extraction components and optimized PCR reagents for only one procedure.

The streamlined workflow takes under one hour to deliver a result, compared to approximately three hours for standard extraction-based quantitative PCR processes and can handle up to 2,600 samples per eight-hour shift per cycler. As a result, labs can significantly accelerate the time to result and the frequency of viral testing. With only three small pipette tips needed per sample, the kit keeps plastic usage to a minimum, while providing significant cost savings by reducing reagent use and labor utilization.

Initial studies run by select public health research institutions have shown that the level of detection of the new QIAprep&amp Viral RNA UM Kit, when used with their assay, is similar to or better than regular PCR workflows, and that performance compares to standard public health protocols of the U.S. Centers of Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO) and others that use the gold standard for sample extraction.

“Brilinta is the best-in-class antiplatelet drug for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), recent stent placement, or a history of myocardial infarction. Like all antiplatelet therapies, it does create some challenges for patients with serious bleeding events or who need urgent surgery,” said John Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of PhaseBio. “In these situations, doctors need an intervention that immediately and sustainably reverses the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor; this is something that currently does not exist. Bentracimab has the potential to be an important solution as it provides immediate and sustained restoration of platelet function, with potential utility across a broad spectrum of bleeding events, urgent surgeries and invasive procedures.”

“With cardiovascular disease representing a leading cause of death in Canada, as in the rest of the world, we expect to continue to see widespread utilization of P2Y12 inhibitors like ticagrelor to help prevent adverse cardiovascular events in vulnerable patients. While ticagrelor is highly efficacious it poses increased risk of serious bleeding, like other P2Y12 inhibitors. The promise of a potential reversal agent addresses a significant unmet clinical need for a large number of patients at risk of severe bleeding or those who may suffer a serious bleeding episode while on ticagrelor,” said Subodh Verma, M.D., Ph.D., a cardiac surgeon and Professor at the University of Toronto, and a member of the REVERSE-IT steering committee and Canadian national lead investigator. “I am delighted that about 20 sites in Canada will participate in this important and potentially practice-changing clinical trial,” said Professor Verma.

“We have seen in prior trials that bentracimab provided immediate restoration of platelet function and believe that it can help ticagrelor patients receive the urgent care they need in cases of acute bleeding or in need of an urgent procedure,” said Dr. C. David Mazer, a Professor of Anesthesiology at the University of Toronto and Canadian investigator on REVERSE-IT. Dr. Mazer continued, “We are delighted to be the first Canadian REVERSE-IT site to participate in the development of this critical therapy for patients in need.”

Jonathan Mow, Chief Executive Officer of PhaseBio added: “With a generic version of Brilinta under regulatory review in Canada and a best-in-class efficacy profile relative to other P2Y12 inhibitors, we anticipate significant growth in market share for ticagrelor in Canada and a growing need for a novel reversal agent like bentracimab. We view the expansion of REVERSE-IT enrollment into Canada as an important milestone for the global bentracimab program.”

Bentracimab has been studied in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and has demonstrated the potential to bring life-saving therapeutic benefit through immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor, potentially mitigating concerns regarding bleeding risks associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs. Additionally, in a translational study, bentracimab achieved equivalent reversal of branded ticagrelor and multiple ticagrelor generics. AstraZeneca reported net sales of $845 million for Brilinta in the first half of 2020, which represents a 15% increase over the prior year’s global total and an increase of 34% in emerging markets.

The Phase 3 clinical study is called REVERSE-IT (Rapid and SustainEd ReVERSal of TicagrElor – Intervention Trial). REVERSE-IT is a multi-center, open-label, prospective single-arm trial designed to study reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor with bentracimab in patients who present with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or who require urgent surgery or invasive procedure. Approximately 200 patients are being targeted to be enrolled from major health centers worldwide. Patients with reported use of ticagrelor within the prior 3 days who require urgent ticagrelor reversal will be eligible for enrollment.

More information about the REVERSE-IT Phase 3 trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov, using the identifier NCT04286438.

About Bentracimab (PB2452)

Bentracimab is a novel, recombinant, human monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment designed to reverse the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in major bleeding and urgent surgery situations. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, bentracimab demonstrated the potential to bring life-saving therapeutic benefit through immediate and sustained reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity, mitigating concerns regarding bleeding risks associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs. The Phase 1 clinical trial of bentracimab in healthy volunteers was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2019. In April 2019, bentracimab received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA. Breakthrough Therapy Designation may be granted by the FDA when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapy. In September 2019, PhaseBio completed a Phase 2a trial in which bentracimab was investigated in older and elderly subjects on dual antiplatelet therapy of ticagrelor and low-dose aspirin. Additionally, the Phase 2a trial investigated a bentracimab regimen for the reversal of supratherapeutic doses of ticagrelor in healthy younger subjects. In both arms of the trial, bentracimab achieved immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor and was generally well-tolerated, with only minor adverse events reported. These results are consistent with the results observed in healthy younger subjects treated with ticagrelor in the previously published Phase 1 trial. PhaseBio initiated the REVERSE-IT trial, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of bentracimab, in March 2020 to support a Biologics License Application for bentracimab in both major bleeding and urgent surgery indications. There are currently no approved reversal agents for ticagrelor or any other antiplatelet drugs.

 BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and supported by Pfizer) encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein (S). It is currently being evaluated in an ongoing P-III study with ~37,000 participants enrolled and 28,000 having received their second vaccination at >120 clinical sites worldwide including the US, Brazil, South Africa, and Argentina","NEW YORK and MAINZ, GERMANY, October 6, 2020 — Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the initiation of a rolling submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for BNT162b2, the lead candidate from the companies’ vaccine development program against COVID-19. The EMA’s decision to start a rolling review follows the encouraging preliminary results from pre-clinical and early clinical studies in adults, which suggest that BNT162b2 triggers the production of neutralizing antibodies and TH-1 dominant CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that target SARS-CoV-2. A combination of an antibody and T cell response is believed to be important in eliciting protection against viral infection and disease. BioNTech and Pfizer plan to work with the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to complete the rolling review process to facilitate the final Marketing Authorization Application (MAA).

As part of the rolling review, the CHMP has begun evaluating data generated in pre-clinical trials. The formal MAA submission could be finalized following the rolling review process, pending demonstration of vaccine efficacy and safety and confirmation from the EMA that the submitted data are adequate. The vaccine candidate will remain subject to the EMA’s diligent standards for quality, safety and efficacy.

“It is our duty to ensure that while we are working to develop a potential vaccine at unprecedented speed to help address this pandemic, we do so with the highest ethical standards while adhering to sound scientific principles. We will continue to have regular and open dialogue with the EMA throughout the rolling review process,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

“A global crisis the magnitude of COVID-19 has completely transformed the vaccine development and review process,” said Peter Honig, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Worldwide Safety and Regulatory of Pfizer. “We are making every effort to develop a safe and effective vaccine following the guidance of regulatory agencies and are proud to take this historic step with the European Medicines Agency for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2.”

The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and supported by Pfizer’s global vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities. It encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein (S), which is a target of virus neutralizing antibodies. The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 3 study ongoing at more than 120 clinical sites worldwide including the United States, Brazil, South Africa and Argentina. To date, the trial has enrolled approximately 37,000 participants with more than 28,000 having received their second vaccination.

Preliminary data from the Phase 1/2 portions of the study have demonstrated that BNT162b2 was well tolerated with mild to moderate adverse events in all age groups. The vaccine candidate generated dose level-dependent immunogenicity, as measured by receptor binding domain (RBD)-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers. In addition, BNT162b2-vaccinated human participants displayed a favorable breadth of epitopes recognized in T cell responses specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, and BNT162b2 demonstrated a concurrent induction of high magnitude CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses which were TH-1 dominant against the RBD and the remainder of the full spike glycoprotein. Full information on previously released data can be found here. For further information about the ongoing Phase 3 trial, visit www.ClinicalTrials.gov using the number NCT04368728.

About the EMA’s Rolling Review

Normally, all data on an investigational medicine’s efficacy, safety and quality and all required documents must be submitted at the start of the evaluation in a complete application for marketing authorization. In the case of a rolling review, the EMA’s CHMP reviews data as they become available from ongoing studies, before a complete application is submitted. Once the CHMP decides that sufficient data are available, the complete application should be submitted by the company. By reviewing the data as they become available, the CHMP can reach its opinion sooner on whether or not the investigational medicine or vaccine should be authorized. After a positive opinion, if adopted by the CHMP, it is the European Commission’s role to grant a Marketing Authorization.

 The collaboration will focus on development of specific antibody candidates identified by Vir’s platforms (VIR-7831 and VIR-7832) which demonstrated high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and highly potent in neutralising SARS-CoV-2 in live virus-cellular assays. The companies plan to proceed directly into P-II clinical trial within next 3 to 5 mos.
 Vir’s antibody platform has been used to identify and develop antibodies for pathogens including Ebola (mAb114, currently in use in the Democratic Republic of Congo), hepatitis B virus, influenza A, SARS-CoV-2, malaria, and others","Companies will combine their unique scientific and technical expertise to combat COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus outbreaks
Promising antibody candidates for SARS-CoV-2 to be accelerated into phase 2 clinical trials within the next three to five months
GSK to make equity investment of $250 million in Vir
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) today announced they have signed a binding agreement to enter into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
The collaboration will use Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventative options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies will leverage GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They will also apply their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.
Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “Vir’s unique antibody platform has precedented success in identifying and developing antibodies as treatments for multiple pathogens, and it is highly complementary with our R&D approach to focus on the science of immunology. I am very excited that the talent and passion of our two companies will come together to develop solutions for multiple diseases, including the very promising antibody candidates targeting COVID-19.”
Due to the urgent patient need for COVID-19 solutions, the initial focus of the collaboration will be to accelerate the development of specific antibody candidates identified by the Vir platform, VIR-7831 and VIR-7832, that have demonstrated high affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and are highly potent in neutralising SARS-CoV-2 in live virus-cellular assays. Subject to regulatory review, the companies plan to proceed directly into a phase 2 clinical trial within the next three to five months.
The collaboration will also utilise Vir’s CRISPR screening and machine learning approach to identify cellular targets whose inhibition can prevent viral infection. Vir has identified multiple potential targets against flu and other respiratory pathogens, as well as hepatitis B virus, and will now focus on SARS-CoV-2.
Additionally, the companies have also agreed to conduct research into SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines by coupling GSK’s vaccines technologies and expertise with Vir’s ability to identify neutralising epitopes that are present across entire viral families. These efforts will be additive to other initiatives GSK is advancing to develop a potential vaccine for COVID-19.
George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO, Vir Biotechnology, said: “It is becoming increasingly clear that multiple therapeutic approaches, used in combination or in sequence, will be necessary to stop this coronavirus pandemic. It is likely that the current coronavirus outbreak will not be the last. These insights are informing our scientific approach and we are pleased to join forces on the execution of this strategy with GSK, who have a like-minded R&D strategy, a deep expertise in vaccines and an impressive global reach to bring medicines to people around the world.”
In addition, to gain access to Vir’s technology, GSK will make an equity investment in Vir of $250 million, priced at $37.73, a 10% premium to the closing share price on Friday, March 27, 2020. The equity investment and collaboration agreement will complete at the same time and are conditional upon customary conditions including regulatory review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

Exact Sciences will compensate Pfizer based on the amount of services provided, along with additional fixed and performance-related fees set forth in the agreement
 Cologuard was approved by US FDA in August 2014 and is included in American Cancer Society’s (2018) colorectal cancer screening guidelines. It is indicated to screen adults (aged 45 yrs. and older) who are at average risk for colorectal cancer by detecting certain DNA markers and blood in the stool
 Cologuard is the first and only FDA-approved non-invasive stool DNA screening test for colorectal cancer. It is an accurate, at-home colon cancer screening option and is uniquely positioned to support screening during this time and after the pandemic abates","MADISON, Wis. and NEW YORK, Oct. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Exact Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: EXAS) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced an extension and amendment of their agreement to promote Cologuard, the first and only FDA-approved non-invasive stool DNA screening test for colorectal cancer. Under terms of the nationwide agreement, Pfizer will continue to provide marketing and related support for Cologuard and join Exact Sciences’ efforts to educate patients, physicians, and health systems about Cologuard.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for convenient, accurate cancer testing options. Outcomes can be dramatically improved if colorectal cancer is caught in early stages, and with more than an estimated one million screening colonoscopies missed this year, there is an urgent need to increase screening rates.1 Cologuard is an accurate, at-home colon cancer screening option and is uniquely positioned to support screening during this time and after the pandemic abates.

“We’re thrilled to continue working with Pfizer to increase screening rates with Cologuard, especially during this critical time,” said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. “Over the past two years, Pfizer has shown incredible commitment to Exact Sciences’ goal of eradicating colorectal cancer by helping detect the disease at its earliest, most treatable stages. The talented Exact Sciences team is excited to continue joining forces with Pfizer to help improve screening rates among the 46 million unscreened Americans.”

In the two years since the partnership began, more than 3 million people were screened with Cologuard and more than 90,000 healthcare providers ordered Cologuard for the first time. The combined teams have also introduced several new direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns and worked with dozens of large health systems to improve colorectal cancer screening rates.

“Now more than ever, Pfizer’s purpose – breakthroughs that change patients’ lives – has taken on an even greater urgency. This partnership is a testament to that purpose, and Pfizer is incredibly proud of the work we have done with Exact Sciences to raise colorectal cancer screening rates,” said Mike Gladstone, Global President of Internal Medicine at Pfizer.

Under the terms of the amended agreement, Pfizer will provide sales and marketing support through the end of 2022 and health system support through the end of 2021. Exact Sciences will compensate Pfizer based on the amount of services provided, along with additional fixed and performance-related fees set forth in the agreement. Exact Sciences will maintain responsibility for all aspects of manufacturing and laboratory operations of Cologuard.

More information about the agreement is available here, in a form 8-K that Exact Sciences has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

About Cologuard
Cologuard was approved by the FDA in August 2014, and results from Exact Sciences’ prospective 90-site, point-in-time, 10,000-patient pivotal trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2014. Cologuard is included in the American Cancer Society’s (2018) colorectal cancer screening guidelines and the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Cologuard is indicated to screen adults 45 years of age and older who are at average risk for colorectal cancer by detecting certain DNA markers and blood in the stool. Do not use Cologuard if you have had precancer, have inflammatory bowel disease and certain hereditary syndromes, or have a personal or family history of colorectal cancer. Cologuard is not a replacement for colonoscopy in high risk patients. Cologuard performance in adults ages 45-49 is estimated based on a large clinical study of patients 50 and older. Cologuard performance in repeat testing has not been evaluated.

The Cologuard test result should be interpreted with caution. A positive test result does not confirm the presence of cancer. Patients with a positive test result should be referred for diagnostic colonoscopy. A negative test result does not confirm the absence of cancer. Patients with a negative test result should discuss with their doctor when they need to be tested again.

Medicare and most major insurers cover Cologuard. For more information about Cologuard, visit www.cologuardtest.com. Rx only.

INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced additional details on its SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody programs – including interim data on combination therapy in recently diagnosed patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 – and plans to make these therapies broadly available to patients.

 Eli Lilly and Company logo. (PRNewsFoto, Eli Lilly and Company) (PRNewsfoto/Eli Lilly and Company) 

“Our teams have worked tirelessly the last seven months to discover and develop these potential antibody treatments,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “We believe the data generated to date provide sufficient evidence that both monotherapy and combination therapy may be effective to treat COVID-19 in patients with a high risk for serious outcomes. Lilly is diligently working with regulators around the world to make these treatments available.”

Investors, media and the general public are invited to a conference call today at noon EDT, where Lilly will provide more data and discussion on these programs. The webcast information is available here. A replay will also be available on the website following the conference call.

Combination therapy clinical trial data
Data from a new interim analysis of the BLAZE-1 clinical trial showed that combination therapy with two of Lilly’s SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies reduced viral load, symptoms and COVID-related hospitalization and ER visits. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study evaluated LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016, which bind complementary regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. The combination cohort enrolled recently diagnosed patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, who were assigned to 2800 mg of each antibody (n=112) or placebo (n=156).

The combination therapy significantly reduced viral load at day 11 (p=0.011), meeting the primary endpoint of the study. Most patients, including those receiving placebo, demonstrated near complete viral clearance by day 11. Further, combination treatment reduced viral levels at day 3 (p=0.016) and day 7 (p<0.001)—earlier time points during the course of infection when higher viral loads are typically seen. Combination therapy also significantly reduced the time-weighted average change from baseline from day 1 to 11. An exploratory analysis showed that the proportion of patients with persistent high viral load at day 7 for combination therapy was lower (3.0 percent) versus placebo (20.8 percent), corresponding to a nominal p value of p<0.0001 without multiplicity adjustment. No emergent putative resistance variants have been observed thus far in patients treated with combination therapy.

Combination therapy also met prespecified clinical endpoints, including the time-weighted average change from baseline in total symptom score from day 1 to 11 (p=0.009). The improvement in symptoms was observed as early as three days after dosing and was similar in magnitude and timing to improvements previously seen with LY-CoV555 monotherapy. The rate of COVID-related hospitalization and ER visits was lower for patients treated with combination therapy (0.9 percent) versus placebo (5.8 percent), a relative risk reduction of 84.5 percent (p=0.049). This was also similar to observations for LY-CoV555 monotherapy.

Combination therapy has been generally well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. In LY-CoV555 monotherapy studies there have been isolated drug-related infusion reactions or hypersensitivity that were generally mild (two reported as serious infusion reactions, all patients recovered). Treatment emergent adverse events were comparable to placebo for both LY-CoV555 monotherapy and combination therapy.

Lilly is working to publish the monotherapy and combination therapy data in peer-reviewed journals as soon as possible.

Manufacturing and supply update

To be able to quickly provide treatment to patients around the world, Lilly invested in large-scale manufacturing of both antibodies at risk – even before data demonstrated their potential to become a meaningful therapeutic option for COVID-19.

For monotherapy, Lilly is focused on the 700 mg dose of LY-CoV555 since similar clinical effects were seen across all dose levels tested in BLAZE-1. Lilly anticipates it could supply as many as one million doses of 700 mg LY-CoV555 monotherapy in Q4 2020, with 100,000 available in October. With respect to the supply of combination therapy, Lilly anticipates it will have 50,000 doses available in Q4 2020. The supply of combination therapy will increase substantially beginning in Q1 2021, as additional manufacturing resources come online throughout the year, including Lilly’s recently announced manufacturing collaboration with Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN). Lilly is also pursuing additional partnerships to provide antibodies to resource-limited countries.

Based on the combination therapy data, along with the previously disclosed findings for LY-CoV555 monotherapy, Lilly has engaged global regulators, including the FDA regarding potential EUA. Lilly has now submitted an initial request for EUA for LY-CoV555 monotherapy in higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We expect to submit a subsequent request for EUA for combination therapy in November, pending clinical trial enrollment, once additional safety data accumulate and sufficient supply is manufactured. Lilly anticipates having data to support a biologics license application (BLA) submission for combination therapy as early as Q2 2021. Conversations with global regulators are ongoing.

The BLAZE-1 clinical trial (NCT04427501) continues to enroll a confirmatory cohort of higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, testing the ability of the antibody combination to reduce the number of patients with persistent high viral load and reduce COVID-related hospitalizations. In addition, Lilly is studying lower doses of combination therapy and alternative delivery options in planned or ongoing clinical trials. Other ongoing clinical trials include a Phase 3 study of LY-CoV555 monotherapy for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987). In addition, LY-CoV555 monotherapy is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 and ACTIV-3 studies of ambulatory and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Data from these other ongoing trials are not yet available. Thus far, over 850 trial participants have been dosed with LY-CoV555 (alone or in combination with LY-CoV016), contributing to the safety data supporting this potential treatment.

Open-label pragmatic study in COVID-19 outpatients

To generate additional efficacy and safety data, Lilly plans to initiate a pragmatic, open-label study in the coming weeks, enrolling patients treated with either monotherapy or combination therapy, with a focus on collecting data regarding hospitalizations, deaths and safety.

Moving forward, LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 will be referred to as bamlanivimab and etesevimab, respectively.

About BLAZE-1
BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than three days prior to drug infusion.

The monotherapy arms of the trial enrolled mild-to-moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, studying three doses of LY-CoV555 (700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg) versus placebo. The combination arm of the trial enrolled mild-to-moderate, recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, studying LY-CoV555 2800 mg plus LY-CoV016 2800 mg versus placebo. Placebo patients were shared across all therapy arms in the completed cohorts.

The primary outcome measure for these completed arms of the BLAZE-1 trial was change from baseline to day 11 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Additional endpoints include the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through day 29, as well as safety.

The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll an estimated 800 participants.

About bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555)
LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. LY-CoV555 emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed enrollment and primary safety assessments of LY-CoV555 in a Phase 1 study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628) and long-term follow-up is ongoing. A Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. Lilly recently initiated a Phase 3 study for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987). In addition, LY-CoV555 is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 and ACTIV-3 studies of ambulatory and hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

About etesevimab (LY-CoV016)
LY-CoV016 (also known as JS016) is a recombinant fully human monoclonal neutralizing antibody, which specifically binds to the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein receptor binding domain with high affinity and can effectively block the binding of the virus to the ACE2 host cell surface receptor. Point mutations were introduced into the native human IgG1 antibody to mitigate effector function. A SARS-CoV-2 challenge study was conducted in rhesus macaques and showed LY-CoV016 is effective for both prophylactic and therapeutic venues against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lilly licensed LY-CoV016 from Junshi Biosciences after it was jointly developed by Junshi Biosciences and Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Science (IMCAS). Junshi Biosciences leads development in Greater China, while Lilly leads development in the rest of the world.

Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study (NCT04441931) of LY-CoV016 in healthy U.S. volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. LY-CoV016 has been well tolerated and no drug-related severe adverse events (SAEs) have been observed to date.

October 07, 2020 08:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time
DURHAM, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Polarean Imaging plc (AIM: POLX), the medical‑imaging technology company, with an investigational drug‑device combination product for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), announces its submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) and request for priority review to the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for hyperpolarised 129Xenon gas used to evaluate pulmonary function and to visualise the lung using MRI.

The submission of the NDA follows the Company’s successful completion of two Phase III clinical trials (the “Clinical Trials”) which demonstrated effective measurement of regional lung ventilation. In the Clinical Trials, Polarean’s 129Xenon gas MRI was used to measure regional pulmonary function in patients with a wide variety of underlying lung diseases who were being evaluated for possible lung resection or lung transplant surgery. As detailed in the Company’s announcement of 29 January 2020, both Clinical Trials met their primary endpoints, showing pre-defined equivalence of hyperpolarised 129Xenon Gas MRI to an approved comparator, 133Xenon Scintigraphy, and displayed a benign safety profile.

129Xenon, when polarised in Polarean’s proprietary drug-device system, permits functional, regional and quantitative imaging of the lungs using MRI, without the risk of exposing patients to ionising radiation. The polarised 129Xenon is administered as an inhaled gas that is given to patients in a 10 second breath-hold MRI procedure.

Commenting on the submission, Richard Hullihen, CEO of Polarean, said: “The NDA submission of 129Xenon gas MRI as a drug-device combination represents another key regulatory milestone for our Company. I am delighted with the performance of Polarean’s team, who have worked tirelessly to achieve this important goal, and would also like to thank the institutions, clinicians and patients who took part in the studies that have formed part of this NDA.

“More than 30 million Americans suffer from a chronic lung disease and we see a significant unmet need for non-invasive, quantitative and cost-effective image-based diagnostic technology without exposing patients to ionising radiation. We look forward to working with the FDA to address this unmet need.”

This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014.

About Polarean (www.polarean.com)

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Polarean, Inc. (together the “Group”) are revenue-generating, medical drug-device combination companies operating in the high-resolution medical imaging market.

The Group develops equipment that enables existing MRI systems to achieve an improved level of pulmonary function imaging and specialises in the use of hyperpolarised Xenon gas (129Xe) as an imaging agent to visualise ventilation.129Xe gas is currently being studied for visualisation of gas exchange regionally in the smallest airways of the lungs, the tissue barrier between the lung, and the bloodstream and in the pulmonary vasculature. Xenon gas exhibits solubility and signal properties that enable it to be imaged within other tissues and organs.

The Group also develops and manufactures high performance MRI radiofrequency (RF) coils which are a required component for imaging 129Xe in the MRI system. The development of these coils by the Group facilitates the adoption of the Xenon technology by providing application-specific RF coils which optimize the imaging of 129Xe in MRI equipment for use as a medical diagnostic as well as a method of monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic intervention.

 Lyumjev is a formulation of insulin lispro, act by speeding up the absorption of insulin in the bloodstream and reduce A1C levels in adults with diabetes and has received the US FDA’s approval on Jun 15, 2020","INDIANAPOLIS and SAN DIEGO, Oct. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXCM) announced today a joint program for U.S. healthcare providers (HCPs) about Lilly’s new rapid-acting mealtime insulin Lyumjev™ (insulin lispro-aabc injection, 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL), now available in U.S. pharmacies, and Dexcom G6 CGM Systems. The program is designed to help clinicians use data to inform diabetes management, including giving visibility to the benefits of a new mealtime insulin.

HCPs treating type 1 and type 2 diabetes will be able to assess their patients’ glucose levels and time in range with Dexcom G6 or Dexcom G6 Pro, either in blinded or unblinded mode, helping them quickly identify adult patients who struggle to manage their postprandial glucose (PPG) levels (glucose levels following meals) and who may benefit from a treatment like Lyumjev. As PPG is often overlooked as a significant contributor to A1C,1 this partnership also aims to elevate PPG monitoring as an important component of diabetes treatment management.

“When it comes to treating diabetes, our partnership with Dexcom has the potential to be meaningful for HCPs who want to help their patients who may be struggling to manage their blood glucose levels after meals,” said Adrienne Brown, vice president, U.S. Diabetes and Connected Care, Lilly. “Through this program, we can inspire confidence as clinicians and their patients evaluate new treatment options by showcasing how using these resources together can inform diabetes care.”

Lilly and Dexcom will enhance HCP education by jointly sharing information about Lyumjev and the Dexcom G6 and G6 Pro through a variety of channels.

“We are thrilled to partner once again with a leader in diabetes care like Lilly,” said Rick Doubleday, chief commercial officer at Dexcom. “Our goal is that the real-time data provided through Dexcom G6 and Dexcom G6 Pro will allow healthcare providers to help their patients with diabetes make more informed decisions, measure and evaluate their time in range, and have more visibility to the potential benefits of transitioning to a new mealtime insulin such as Lyumjev.”

Those interested in learning more about Dexcom CGM or getting started on the Dexcom G6 should visit Dexcom.com. The Dexcom G6 is covered by 98 percent of private insurance in the U.S., by Medicare and by Medicaid in many states across the country. Dexcom also recently launched a patient assistance program available to current U.S. customers who lost their health insurance coverage due to the impacts of COVID-19.

Lyumjev is a novel formulation of insulin lispro, developed to speed the absorption of insulin into the bloodstream and reduce A1C levels in adults with diabetes. In clinical studies, Lyumjev provided superior reduction in blood sugar spikes compared with Humalog® (insulin lispro injection) when blood sugar was measured 1 and 2 hours after a meal. Lyumjev was approved by the FDA on June 15, 2020. HCPs can now prescribe Lyumjev, which is available for pharmacies nationwide to order.

PURPOSE and SAFETY SUMMARY

Important Facts About LYUMJEV™ (LOOM-jehv) and Humalog® (HU-ma-log)

Lyumjev is also known as insulin lispro-aabc injection. Humalog is also known as insulin lispro injection.
Lyumjev is a fast-acting insulin. Lyumjev is used to control high blood sugar in adults with diabetes. Humalog is a fast-acting insulin. Humalog is used to control high blood sugar in adults and children with diabetes. Lyumjev and Humalog are available only with a prescription.
Lyumjev comes in two strengths: U-100 (100 units per milliliter) and U-200 (200 units per milliliter). The Lyumjev U-200 prefilled pen contains 2 times as much insulin per 1 milliliter as standard (U-100) insulin. Humalog U-100 contains 100 units of insulin per milliliter. The dose window of the pen shows the number of insulin units to be delivered.
It is not known if Lyumjev is safe and effective for children. It is not known if Humalog is safe and effective for children with type 2 diabetes or for children younger than 3 years of age with type 1 diabetes as there were no studies done with Humalog in these groups of children. If your doctor decides to give your child any insulin products, he or she may give you special instructions.
All Lyumjev and Humalog products contain insulin lispro. 

Warnings

Do not take Lyumjev or Humalog if you have:

symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
an allergy to Lyumjev or Humalog or any of their ingredients.
Do not reuse needles or share your insulin injection supplies with other people. This includes your:

prefilled pen for use by a single patient
cartridges
reusable pen that works with Lilly 3mL cartridges available for Humalog
needles
syringes
You or the other person can get a serious infection. This can happen even if you change the needle. 

Do not change the type of insulin you take or your dose, unless your doctor tells you to. This could cause low or high blood sugar, which could be serious.

Do not use a syringe to remove Lyumjev or Humalog from your prefilled pen. This can cause you to take too much insulin. Taking too much insulin can lead to severe low blood sugar. This may result in seizures or death.

Lyumjev and Humalog may cause serious side effects. Some of these can lead to death. The possible serious side effects are:

Low blood sugar. This can cause:
• dizziness or lightheadedness

• sweating

• confusion

• headache

• blurred vision

• slurred speech

• shakiness

• fast heartbeat

• anxiety

• irritability

• mood change

• hunger

If you are at risk of having severely low blood sugar, your doctor may prescribe a glucagon emergency kit. These are used when your blood sugar becomes too low and you are unable to take sugar by mouth. Glucagon helps your body release sugar into your bloodstream.

Severe allergic reaction.
Get emergency help right away if you have:
• a rash over your whole body

• trouble breathing

• a fast heartbeat

• sweating

• a faint feeling

• shortness of breath

• extreme drowsiness

• dizziness

• confusion

• swelling of your face, tongue,
or throat

Low potassium in your blood. This can lead to severe breathing problems, irregular heartbeat, and death.
Heart failure. Taking diabetes pills called thiazolidinediones (thIE-uh-zOH-li-dEEn-dIE-OHns), or “TZDs,” with Lyumjev or Humalog may cause heart failure in some people. This includes people who do not have any heart problems. If you have heart failure, it may get worse if you take TZDs with Lyumjev or Humalog. Tell your doctor if you have any new symptoms of heart failure, or if they get worse. Some symptoms of heart failure include: shortness of breath, swelling of ankles and feet, and sudden weight gain. Your doctor may need to change or stop treatment with TZDs and your insulin lispro product.
High blood sugar and ketoacidosis for Humalog insulin pump users. You can have these serious problems when your insulin pump or infusion set stops working. They can also happen if your insulin is no longer effective. For these reasons, always keep extra insulin injection supplies with you.
Common side effects

The most common side effects of Lyumjev and Humalog are:

• low blood sugar

• allergic reactions

• reactions where you have injected insulin

• skin thickening or pits at the injection

 site

• itching

• weight gain

• rash

Other most common side effects with Humalog include swelling of your hands or feet.

These are not all of the possible side effects. Tell your doctor if you have any side effects. You can report side effects at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

Before using

Talk with your doctor about low blood sugar and how to manage it. Also tell your doctor:

about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
about any other prescription medicines you take, especially ones called TZDs.
about all of your medical conditions, including if you have heart failure or other heart, liver, or kidney problems.
if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed.
How to take

Read the Instructions for Use that come with your Lyumjev or Humalog. Be sure to take your Lyumjev or Humalog and check your blood sugar levels exactly as your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to change your dose because of illness, increased stress, or changes in your weight, diet, or physical activity level. He or she may also tell you to change the amount or time of your dose because of other medicines or different types of insulin you take.

Before injecting your Lyumjev or Humalog

You can inject your insulin dose yourself, or you can have a trained caregiver inject it for you. Make sure you or your caregiver:

Check the insulin label before each injection. This will help you make sure that you are taking the correct insulin.
Use a new needle for each injection. You can get a serious infection or the wrong dose of insulin if you re-use needles.
Change (rotate) where you inject your insulin with each dose. This can reduce your chance of getting pits, lumps, or thickened skin where you inject your insulin. Do not inject your insulin into the exact same spot or where the skin has pits or lumps. Avoid injecting into thickened, tender, bruised, scaly, hard, scarred, or damaged skin.
When you are ready to inject

Inject Lyumjev under your skin at the beginning of a meal or within 20 minutes after you start eating a meal.
Inject Humalog under your skin within 15 minutes before or right after you eat a meal.
Staying safe while taking your Lyumjev or Humalog

To stay safe while taking your insulin, be sure to never inject Lyumjev U-200 in your vein, muscle, or with an insulin pump. Also be sure not to:

mix Lyumjev with other insulins
drive or use heavy machinery until you know how your Lyumjev or Humalog affects you.
drink alcohol or use other medicines that contain alcohol when taking your Lyumjev or Humalog.

50015,BMS' Zeposia (ozanimod) Receives Health Canada Approval for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis,"Health Canada Approves ZEPOSIA®, an Oral Treatment for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis","The approval is based on P-lll SUNBEAM & RADIANCE part B study which involves the assessing of Zeposia (0.92mg and 0.46 mg) vs Avonex (qw, IM) in 1,346 & 1313 patients with RMS for 12 & 24mos. across 158 & 150 sites in 20 & 21 countries respectively
 Result: relative reduction in ARR (48% & 38%); absolute ARR (0.18 vs 0.35 & 0.17 vs 0.28). reduction in number of T1– weighted GdE (0.16 vs 0.43 & 0.18 vs 0.37); reduction in enlarging T2 brain lesions (1.47 vs 2.84 & 1.84 vs 3.18) respectively
 Zeposia is the only first line S1P receptor modulator approved in Canada for the treatment of RRMS, acts by decreasing the frequency of clinical exacerbations","Bristol Myers Squibb’s medication provides a new oral treatment option for Canadians living with the neurological disease

MONTREAL, Oct. 7, 2020 /CNW/ – Bristol Myers Squibb announced today that Health Canada approved ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod) for the treatment of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations.

“Ongoing treatment with disease-modifying therapy in people living with multiple sclerosis can reduce the number of relapses and new brain lesions that form, but each person responds differently to different treatments. This is why having another treatment with meaningful efficacy to help decrease relapses and brain lesions is important,” said Dr. Jiwon Oh, Neurologist and MS specialist. “Today’s announcement is exciting because it addresses an unmet need for people when first diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. Having an oral treatment with evidence of higher efficacy than some other first-line treatments, and a good safety profile that is well-tolerated to manage clinical exacerbations and whole brain volume loss will be a benefit to people living with MS.”

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerves; ii this causes inflammation and often damages the myelin in patches called lesions. iii When this happens, the normal flow of nerve impulse is delayed or blocked, leading to symptoms.iii

RRMS is characterized by unpredictable clinical exacerbations manifested by relapses (also known as attacks, exacerbations or flare-ups) and accumulation of lesions in the CNS during which new symptoms appear or existing ones get worse.ii

“Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable neurological disease that impacts more than 77,000 Canadians,” said Dr. Pamela Valentine, president and CEO, MS Society of Canada. “With Canada having one of the highest prevalence rates in the world and no one size fits all approach to treatment, we want to continue seeing innovation and are pleased that there will be another effective oral treatment option.”

ZEPOSIA® is an oral medication taken daily that helps protect against attacks on the nerves by stopping some of the body’s white cells (‘lymphocytes’) reaching the brain and spine where they could cause inflammation and damage to myelin, the nerves protective coating.i It is the only oral selective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator approved in Canada as a first-line therapyi,iv for the treatment of RRMS. The approval is based on data from the two largest pivotal, head-to-head RRMS studies with an active comparator to date.v

“This approval reinforces our commitment to transforming patients’ lives and delivering innovative treatment options,” said Al Reba, General Manager, Bristol Myers Squibb Canada. “Bringing to market a new oral treatment option for multiple sclerosis, a disease that impacts so many Canadians, gives us the opportunity to help improve the future for younger higher- functioning MS patients who need to maintain high physical and cognitive ability.”

The Health Canada approval is based on data from the randomized, active-controlled Phase 3 SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B clinical trials, which enrolled more than 2,600 patients across 150 sites in more than 20 countries.i,iv Key findings from the trials include:

ZEPOSIA® (0.92 mg) demonstrated a relative reduction in ARR versus AVONEX® of 48 per cent through one year in the SUNBEAM study and 38 per cent at two years in the RADIANCE study (absolute ARR of 0.18 versus 0.35 and 0.17 versus 0.28, respectively).i,v,iv
At one year in the SUNBEAM study, treatment with ZEPOSIA® reduced the number of T1– weighted gadolinium-enhanced (GdE) brain lesions more than AVONEX® (0.16 vs 0.43), a relative reduction of 63 per cent, and reduced the number of new or enlarging T2 brain lesions (1.47 versus 2.84), a relative reduction of 48 per cent.i,iv
At two years in the RADIANCE study, treatment with ZEPOSIA® reduced the number of T1– weighted GdE brain lesions more than AVONEX® (0.18 versus 0.37), a relative reduction of 53 per cent. ZEPOSIA® also reduced the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions versus AVONEX® (1.84 versus 3.18), a relative reduction of 42 per cent.i,iv
About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective covering of the nerves, called myelin, causing inflammation and damage. Myelin is necessary for the transmission of nerve impulses.ii

Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is characterized by unpredictable but clearly defined relapses (also known as attacks, exacerbations or flare-ups) during which new symptoms appear or existing ones get worse. Approximately 85 per cent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS.ii

Canada has one of the highest rates of multiple sclerosis in the world, with an estimated 77,000 people living with the disease. While it is most often diagnosed in young adults aged 20 to 49, younger children and older adults are also diagnosed.ii

About SUNBEAM™
SUNBEAM is a pivotal, phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral ZEPOSIA® (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI, respectively) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX® (interferon beta-1a) for at least a 12-month treatment period. iv The study included 1,346 people living with RMS across 158 sites in 20 countries.iv

The primary endpoint of the trial was annualized relapse rates (ARR) during the treatment period.iv The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months and number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 12.iv

About RADIANCE™
RADIANCE Part B is a pivotal, Phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double- dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral ZEPOSIA® (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI, respectively) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX® (interferon beta-1a) over a 24-month treatment period. The study included 1313 people living with RMS across 150 sites in 21 countries.v

The primary endpoint of the trial was ARR over 24 months.v The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 24 months and the number of MRI T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions at 24 months.v

About ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod)
ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod) is for the treatment of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations.i It is the only first line sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator approved in Canada for the treatment of RRMS. ZEPOSIA® binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5 to reduce the number of attacks.i It is taken orally as a capsule, once daily, with or without food.i

50023,BioMarin Receives the US FDA's Approval Allowing Maximum Dose of 60mg with Palynziq (pegvaliase-pqpz) for PKU,"BioMarin, Pioneer in Rare Disease Treatments for Phenylketonuria (PKU), Receives FDA Approval of Label Expansion to Allow Maximum Dose of 60 mg for Palynziq® (pegvaliase-pqpz) Injection for Treatment of Adults with PKU","The US FDA has approved the sBLA to increase the maximum allowable dose of 60mg with Palynziq for PKU. Previously, the maximum dose was 40mg
 The label expansion is based on OLE study out to 3yrs. demonstrating that 66% had a blood Phe level ≤360 μmol/L consistent with the Phe target ACMG recommended guidelines @2yrs. of treatment and 50% had blood Phe levels ≤120 μmol/L @2yrs. 75%, 66% & 48% had a blood Phe ≤600, 360, and 120 μmol /L, respectively @3yrs. of treatment
 Additional, safety data with over 6yrs. of follow up remains consistent with the previous safety profile of Palynziq irrespective of dose. Moreover, BioMarin has dosed the first participant in the global Phearless P-I/II study of BMN 307 for PKU","SAN RAFAEL, Calif., Oct. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:BMRN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to increase the maximum allowable dose of 60 mg with Palynziq® (pegvaliase-pqpz) Injection for treatment of adults with Phenylketonuria (PKU). Previously, the maximum dose was 40 mg. In the Phase 3 PRISM studies, 19% of study participants required a 60 mg dose to achieve adequate response to Palynziq.

The label expansion includes the addition of longer-term efficacy data demonstrating sustained phenylalanine (Phe) lowering out to three years and over six years of data further supporting a well-characterized safety profile. The labeling was updated to allow individualized maintenance dosage to achieve blood Phe control (blood Phe concentrations less than or equal to 600 μmol/L), taking into account patient tolerability to Palynziq and dietary protein intake.

Palynziq is indicated to reduce blood Phe concentrations in adults with phenylketonuria (PKU), who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 μmol/L on existing management. Palynziq, a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme, is the first and only approved enzyme substitution therapy to target the underlying cause of PKU by helping the body to break down Phe.

Palynziq is BioMarin’s second approved treatment for this serious condition. BioMarin also recently announced that the Company had dosed the first participant in the global Phearless Phase 1/2 study of BMN 307, an investigational gene therapy for people with PKU, and potentially its third approved treatment. BMN 307 has Fast Track Designation in the US, as well as Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. and E.U.

This labeling long term data update is based on efficacy data from an open-label extension study out to three years demonstrating that two-thirds (66%) of the 86 participants treated for at least two years, had a blood Phe level ≤360 μmol/L consistent with the Phe target in American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommended guidelines, and 50% of participants had blood Phe levels ≤120 μmol/L at two years. Of the 77 participants treated for at least three years, 58 (75%), 51 (66%), and 37 (48%) had a blood Phe concentration less than or equal to 600, 360, and 120 μmol /L, respectively, at three years of treatment. Additional safety data with over six years of follow up remains consistent with the previous safety profile of Palynziq, irrespective of dose.

PKU is a rare genetic disease that manifests at birth and results in a variety of cumulative toxic effects on the brain. PKU affects approximately 1 in 12,500 live births in the United States each year. PKU is marked by an inability to break down Phe, an amino acid that is found in all forms of protein. Left untreated, high levels of Phe become toxic to the brain and may lead to serious neurological and neuropsychological impairment, affecting a person’s ability to think and problem solve, and can lead to depression, anxiety, and behavior disturbance impacting quality of life. Due to the seriousness of these symptoms, infants are screened at birth to ensure that they are diagnosed early and treated to avoid intellectual disability and other complications. Individuals living with PKU require life-long management, including adherence to a challenging and severely restrictive daily diet of medical foods and formula that avoids the ingestion of Phe that is present in most foods.

“BioMarin is pleased that the FDA has recognized the importance of including an additional dosing option to individuals with PKU. Consistent with the label in Europe, Palynziq is now available in the U.S. at doses of up to 60 mg,” said Jean-Jacques Bienaimé, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioMarin. “BioMarin remains committed to the PKU community and continues to build on our 15 plus years of research and development, which enabled us to deliver the first two PKU drug therapies. We continue our commitment to further understand the safety and efficacy of our treatments for PKU. We are grateful to the study participants, investigators, study staff and BioMarin employees who were essential to enable this label expansion.”

“Adding a maximum dose of 60 mg allows more patients to optimize and achieve treatment goals to keep blood Phe levels within the range set in the medical guidelines or within normal range,” said Cary Harding, M.D., professor at Oregon Health & Science University and Steering Committee Chair for the Palynziq program. “More than six years of long-term safety data further supports a well-characterized safety profile similar to the initial data and is important information to physicians considering a chronic therapy.”

“It is essential to the PKU community to have treatment options that can control Phe levels and provide long term data on safety and efficacy as it becomes available. The additional information added to the Palynziq label, particularly the long-term safety follow-up demonstrates BioMarin’s ongoing commitment to people with PKU,” said Christine Brown, MS, executive director of the National PKU Alliance. “BioMarin’s 15-year focus on innovative medical research to advance the standard of care in PKU with an existing treatment and for new treatments is transforming the way that the community thinks about this rare genetic disease.”

BioMarin’s 15-Plus Year Commitment to PKU Research

For more than 15 years, BioMarin has been a pioneer in ongoing research to help improve the lives of PKU patients. BioMarin has developed therapies that have been used to treat approximately 7,000 PKU patients around the world. The company has two approved PKU therapies, and an investigational gene therapy BMN 307 is currently in development. BioMarin has conducted 41 clinical studies in PKU and has sponsored 44 external clinical studies. BioMarin researchers have authored 65 publications in medical and scientific journals on PKU and supported another 57 publications by external researchers.

About Phenylketonuria

PKU, or phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 70,000 diagnosed patients in the regions of the world where BioMarin operates and is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme PAH. This enzyme is required for the metabolism of Phe, an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. If the active enzyme is not present in sufficient quantities, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood and becomes toxic to the brain, resulting in a variety of complications including severe intellectual disability, seizures, tremors, behavioral problems and psychiatric symptoms. As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all individuals with PKU under the age of 40 in countries with newborn screening programs are diagnosed at birth and treatment is implemented soon after. PKU can be managed with a severe Phe-restricted diet, which is supplemented by low-protein modified foods and Phe-free medical foods; however, it is difficult for most patients to adhere to the life-long strict diet to the extent needed to achieve adequate control of blood Phe levels. Dietary control of Phe in childhood can prevent major developmental neurological toxicities, but poor control of Phe in adolescence and adulthood is associated with a range of neurocognitive disabilities with significant functional impact.

About ACMG Guidelines

Practice guidelines issued by ACMG support the need for lifelong management of Phe levels in patients with PKU. The diagnosis and management guidelines were published online in Genetics In Medicine’s Advance Online Publication (AOP) service.

The guidelines state that treatment of PKU should be initiated as early as possible and must be continued throughout adulthood and “lifelong,” with a goal of maintaining blood levels of Phe for all patients between 120 to 360 micromol/L. Patients treated from the early weeks of life with initial good metabolic control, but who lose that control in later childhood or adult life, may experience both reversible and irreversible neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric consequences.

According to the guidelines “the primary goal of therapy is to lower blood Phe, and any interventions, including medications, or combination of therapies that help to achieve that goal in an individual, without other negative consequences, should be considered appropriate therapy.”

Evidence for the guidelines are drawn from two previous independent review processes from the National Institutes of Health (2001) and the Agency for Health Research and Quality (2012). The guidelines can be accessed here.

About Palynziq

Palynziq substitutes the deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme in PKU with the PEGylated version of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase to break down Phe. Palynziq is administered using a dosing regimen designed to facilitate tolerability; Palynziq’s safety profile consists primarily of immune-mediated responses, including anaphylaxis, for which robust risk management measures effective in clinical trials are in place.

The dosing and administration of Palynziq follows an induction, titration, and maintenance paradigm. Treatment is individualized to the lowest effective and tolerated dosage. Prescribers may consider increasing from 20 mg to 40 mg in patients who have been on 20 mg once daily continuously for at least 24 weeks and who have not achieved blood Phe control. Prescribers may increase dosage to a maximum of 60 mg once daily in patients who have been on 40 mg once daily continuously for at least 16 weeks and who have not achieved blood Phe control. Prescribers are instructed to discontinue treatment in patients who have not responded after 16 weeks of continuous treatment with the maximum dosage of 60 mg once daily. Periodic blood Phe monitoring is recommended, and patients should be counseled on how to adjust their dietary intake, as needed, based on blood Phe concentrations.

50080,Lilly and Incyte's Olumiant (baricitinib) Reports Additional Data Demonstrating Reduction in COVID-19 Recovery Time,"Baricitinib has Significant Effect on Recovery Time, Most Impactful in COVID-19 Patients Requiring Oxygen","The companies shared the additional efficacy and safety data of the ACTT-2 study demonstrating baricitinib + remdesivir reduced time to recovery and improved clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection compared with remdesivir as monothx
 The biggest benefits were observed in patients requiring supplemental oxygen (grade 5 on the eight-point ordinal scale) and those who required high-flow oxygen/non-invasive ventilation (grade 6) at baseline
 Additionally, Eli Lilly is in talks with the US FDA for EUA of baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor licensed to Lilly from Incyte) to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19","INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Incyte (NASDAQ: INCY) are sharing additional data showing baricitinib in combination with remdesivir reduced time to recovery and improved clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection compared with remdesivir. This finding was part of additional efficacy and safety data from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) presented today by John Beigel, M.D., associate director for clinical research in the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at NIAID. These data were presented at a special International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Virus Diseases Antiviral Group (isirv-AVG) Virtual Conference on ‘Therapeutics for COVID-19.’ The largest benefits were observed in patients requiring supplemental oxygen (grade 5 on the eight-point ordinal scale) and those who required high-flow oxygen/non-invasive ventilation (grade 6) at baseline.

New data presented today provide a better understanding of the improved clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 infection who received baricitinib, including data for mortality. As previously reported, ACTT-2 achieved the primary endpoint, demonstrating that the overall patient population treated with baricitinib in combination with remdesivir improved their median time to recovery from 8 to 7 days in comparison to remdesivir, a 12.5% improvement (incidence rate ratio: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.32; p=0.04). Recovery was defined as the participant being well enough for hospital discharge, meaning the participant either no longer required supplemental oxygen or ongoing medical care in the hospital, or was no longer hospitalized at Day 29. The study also met a pre-specified secondary endpoint. Using the ordinal scale that ranged from recovered to death, the odds of improvement in clinical status at Day 15 were 30% greater in patients being treated with baricitinib in combination with remdesivir compared with remdesivir (odds ratio 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6; p=0.04).

A numerical decrease in death (35%) through Day 29 was observed in patients treated with baricitinib plus remdesivir compared to remdesivir in the overall population (5.1% vs. 7.8%, respectively; hazard ratio: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.39, 1.08; p=0.09). The reduction in mortality was more pronounced for patients receiving oxygen, as mortality at Day 29 was 60% lower and 43% lower for the OS5 and OS6 subgroups respectively. No new safety signals were observed for baricitinib-treated patients in this study. NIAID authors are working to have the full analysis completed and a peer-reviewed manuscript will be made available soon.

“We are excited that these results add to the potential role for baricitinib to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients,” said Ilya Yuffa, Lilly senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. “Lilly is committed to identifying impactful preventions and treatments, and we are engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding the potential to make baricitinib available to hospitalized patients as quickly as possible.”

Lilly is continuing conversations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) around the potential for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of baricitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor licensed to Lilly from Incyte, to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In the U.S., baricitinib has not been approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19, and the efficacy and safety of baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19 has not been established.

Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients

OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS 

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. If positive, start treatment for latent infection prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:

Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT ≥5x upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST ≥10x ULN were observed in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

HYPERSENSITIVITY: Reactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug sensitivity have been observed in patients receiving Olumiant, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue Olumiant while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg and placebo, respectively.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

50087,Neurocrine Presents New Data Analyses of Ongentys (opicapone) for Parkinson Disease at ANA 2020 Virtual Meeting,Neurocrine Biosciences to Present New Data Analyses of Once-Daily ONGENTYS® (opicapone) in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease at the American Neurological Association 2020 Virtual Meeting,"In a post-hoc, sub-group analysis of the P-III BIPARK-1 study demonstrated greater reductions in overnight “off” time and time to morning “on” time compared to entacapone in patients with PD with motor fluctuations
 The new P-III post-hoc sub-group analysis demonstrated that long-term treatment with Ongentys when used as an add-on therapy reduced “On” time with troublesome dyskinesia and increased good “On” time without troublesome dyskinesia in patients with PD with motor fluctuations
 Long term use of therapy leads to a reduction in the patient’s average daily levodopa dosage requirement. Ongentys (qd, PO) is a selective and reversible COMT inhibitor and has received the US FDA’s approval as an add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with PD experiencing “off” episodes","SAN DIEGO, Sept. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced it will present data analyses evaluating the efficacy and safety of ONGENTYS® (opicapone) capsules, recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first and only once-daily catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor as an add-on to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson’s disease experiencing “off” episodes. New data from a post-hoc, sub-group analysis of Phase III data showed that ONGENTYS led to greater reductions in overnight “off” time and time to morning “on” time compared to entacapone in patients with Parkinson’s disease with motor fluctuations. In another Phase III post-hoc sub-group analysis, long-term use of ONGENTYS in patients with Parkinson’s disease with motor fluctuations reduced “on” time with troublesome dyskinesia and increased good “on” time without troublesome dyskinesia. In this analysis, long-term use of ONGENTYS was associated with a reduction in the patient’s average daily levodopa dosage requirement. These data will be presented in collaboration with BIAL at the American Neurological Association (ANA) 2020 Virtual Meeting on October 4–9, 2020.

“As Parkinson’s disease progresses and the benefit of treatment with levodopa/carbidopa begins to wear off between doses, many patients experience increased fluctuation and unpredictability in their motor function, which can include more ‘off’ time overnight and during the day, and a reduction in good ‘on’ time where movement is close to normal,” said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. “These post-hoc analyses from the Phase III clinical trials of ONGENTYS provide further insight on how adding once-daily ONGENTYS to levodopa/carbidopa can help patients with Parkinson’s disease better manage disruptive motor fluctuations over the course of the day.”

The six ONGENTYS abstracts that will be presented at the ANA 2020 Virtual Meeting are:

Long-Term Efficacy of Opicapone in the Reduction of ON-Time with Troublesome Dyskinesia in Parkinson’s Disease Patients with Motor Fluctuations and Reporting Troublesome Dyskinesia (Poster #489)
Effects of Once-Daily Opicapone on Duration of Overnight OFF and Time to Morning ON in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease and Motor Fluctuations (Poster #494)
Efficacy of Opicapone at Different Levodopa Regimens up to a Threshold of 600 mg/day Levodopa in Parkinson’s Disease Patients with Motor Fluctuations (Poster #490)
Effect of Opicapone and Entacapone on Early Morning-OFF Pattern in Parkinson’s Disease Patients with Motor Fluctuations (Poster #477)
Characterization of the Pattern of Daily Motor Fluctuations in Parkinson’s Disease Patients Based on Home Diaries (Poster #493)
Onset of Drug-Related Adverse Events in Parkinson’s Disease Patients with Motor Fluctuations Treated with Opicapone in Clinical Practice: OPTIPARK Post-Hoc Analysis (Poster #485)
About Parkinson’s Disease
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately one million people in the United States and six million people worldwide. Parkinson’s disease is caused by low dopamine levels produced in the brain. Dopamine helps transmit signals between the areas of the brain that control all purposeful movements, including talking, walking and writing. As Parkinson’s disease progresses, dopamine production steadily decreases, resulting in increased problems with motor symptoms including slowed movement (bradykinesia), tremor, rigidity, impaired posture and balance, and difficulty with speech and writing.

There is presently no cure for Parkinson’s disease and management of the disease consists of the use of treatments that attempt to control motor symptoms primarily through dopaminergic mechanisms. The current gold standard for treatment of motor symptoms is levodopa/carbidopa. While levodopa/carbidopa improves patients’ motor symptoms, as the disease progresses, the beneficial effects of levodopa begin to wear off more quickly. Patients then experience motor fluctuations throughout the day between “on” time, periods when the medication is working and Parkinson’s disease symptoms are controlled, and “off” time, when the medication is not working and motor symptoms return.

About ONGENTYS® (opicapone) Capsules 
ONGENTYS is a unique, once-daily, oral, peripheral, selective and reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson’s disease experiencing “off” episodes. ONGENTYS inhibits the COMT enzyme, which breaks down levodopa, making more levodopa available to reach the brain.

In June 2016, BIAL – Portela & CA, S.A. (BIAL) received approval from the European Commission for ONGENTYS as an adjunct therapy to preparations of levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations who cannot be stabilized on those combinations. BIAL currently markets ONGENTYS in Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and Italy. Neurocrine Biosciences in-licensed opicapone from BIAL in 2017 and has exclusive development and commercialization rights in the U.S. and Canada.

50102,J&amp;J to Supply EU with up to 400M Doses of its COVID-19 Vaccine,Johnson & Johnson Announces European Commission Approval of Agreement to Supply 200 Million Doses of Janssen’s COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate,"EC has approved an advance purchase agreement in which the Janssen will supply 200 M doses of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate to EU member states following approval from regulators. Additionally, the EU member states have an option to secure up to 200M additional doses
 The agreement follows the conclusion of exploratory talks with the EC. Apart from the agreement, J&J plans to allocate up to 500M vaccine doses toward international efforts for ensuring access in lower income countries, with delivery beginning in mid-2021, following approval
 J&J is evaluating a single dose regimen in P-III ENSEMBLE study initiated in Sept’2020 and plans the initiation of P-III study with a two-dose regimen later this year","New Brunswick, N.J., October 8, 2020 – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today announced the European Commission (EC), acting on behalf of the European Union (EU) Member States, has approved an Advance Purchase Agreement in which the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies will supply 200 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate to EU Member States following approval or authorization from regulators. The EU Member States also have the option to secure up to 200 million additional doses.

“The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten communities worldwide and we have a responsibility to ensure access to our COVID-19 vaccine as soon as we can. We appreciate the Commission’s and the Member States’ support for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate and development efforts,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson.

This contract follows the conclusion of exploratory talks with the EC. The Company is in ongoing discussions with other stakeholders, including national governments and global organizations, as part of its efforts to meet its commitment to make its vaccine candidate accessible globally, provided the vaccine has a good safety profile, is efficacious and receives approval or authorization from regulators.

Separate to the agreement with the EC, as part of the Company’s larger commitment to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson & Johnson has also announced plans to allocate up to 500 million vaccine doses toward international efforts to ensure access for lower income countries, with delivery beginning mid next year following approval or authorization from regulators. Recognizing the unique global demand for COVID-19 vaccines, we are working tirelessly to further expand the number of available doses.

Johnson & Johnson is developing and testing Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate in accordance with its usual rigorous ethical standards of safety and sound scientific principles. The Company is evaluating a single-dose regimen in its large-scale, pivotal, multi-country Phase 3 trial (ENSEMBLE) that started in September. A second Phase 3 study with a two-dose regimen is planned to start later this year. The Company is committed to transparency and sharing information related to the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study – including the study protocol.

Janssen’s investigational COVID-19 vaccine leverages Janssen’s AdVac® technology. The same technology was used to develop Janssen’s EC-approved Ebola vaccine regimen and is the basis for its HIV, RSV and Zika vaccine candidates. To date, more than 100,000 individuals have been vaccinated with a Janssen AdVac®-based vaccine. Based on our understanding of the stability of our vaccines, we anticipate our COVID-19 vaccine candidate to be compatible with standard distribution channels without the need for new distribution infrastructure.

50110,Amgen Report Mixed Results of Omecamtiv Mecarbil in P-lll GALACTIC-HF Study for Heart Failure,"Amgen, Cytokinetics And Servier Announce Topline Results From GALACTIC-HF, A Phase 3 Trial Of Omecamtiv Mecarbil In Patients With Heart Failure","The P-lll GALACTIC-HF study involves the assessing of Omecamtiv mecarbil (25mg, bid with the maintenance dose of 50 mg, 37.5mg, or 25mg, bid) vs PBO in 8,256 patients with HFrEF
 Result: The study met its 1EPs of reduction in CV death or HF events (HF hospitalization and other urgent treatment for HF) while the study did not meet its 2EPs of reduction in time to CV death, presented at AHA 2020
 Omecamtiv mecarbil is a cardiac myosin activator, targeting the contractile mechanisms of the heart, being developed under a collaboration between Amgen and Cytokinetics, with funding and strategic support from Servier","THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and SURESNES, France, Oct. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Cytokinetics, Incorporated (NASDAQ:CYTK) and Servier today announced topline results from GALACTIC-HF, a Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

The results of GALACTIC-HF show that treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil achieved the primary composite efficacy endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant effect to reduce cardiovascular (CV) death or heart failure events (heart failure hospitalization and other urgent treatment for heart failure) compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.99, p=0.0252).

No reduction in the secondary endpoint of CV death was observed. Adverse events, including major ischemic cardiac events, were balanced between treatment arms. Additional analyses of data are underway and results from GALACTIC-HF will be presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2020, in a virtual Late Breaking Clinical Trial session on Friday, November 13, 2020 from 10:35-10.45 a.m. CDT.

Omecamtiv mecarbil is an investigational cardiac myosin activator, the first of a novel class of myotropes1 designed to directly target the contractile mechanisms of the heart.

“The outcomes observed in GALACTIC-HF further the understanding of treating heart failure, a devastating disease in which half of heart failure patients will die within five years of initial hospitalization,” said David M. Reese, M.D. executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “At Amgen, we remain committed to developing and delivering transformative medicines that improve the lives of patients with cardiovascular disease.”

“GALACTIC-HF provides insights into effects associated with targeting cardiac muscle contractility with omecamtiv mecarbil to treat heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction,” said Fady I. Malik, M.D., Ph.D., Cytokinetics’ executive vice president of Research & Development. “We are grateful to the trial investigators, site personnel, patients and caregivers who participated in the trial, and we look forward to further data analyses and the presentation of the results of this Phase 3 trial at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions.”

“Heart failure is a devastating condition jeopardizing patients’ lives every day. We are pleased to have collaborated with Amgen and Cytokinetics on one of the largest heart failure trials ever conducted to investigate this novel therapy in patients with heart failure. It is important to now turn our attention to fully analyzing the data from this important study in this clinical setting,” said Claude Bertrand, PharmD, PhD, Executive Vice President R&D at Servier.

GALACTIC-HF: Trial Design
GALACTIC-HF,2 (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure), one of the largest Phase 3 global cardiovascular outcomes studies in heart failure ever conducted, enrolled 8,256 patients in 35 countries with HFrEF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%, elevated natriuretic peptides and either current hospitalization for heart failure or history of hospitalization or emergency department visit for heart failure within a year. Patients were randomized to either oral placebo or a starting dose of 25 mg omecamtiv mecarbil twice daily (maintenance dose of 50 mg, 37.5 mg, or 25 mg twice daily) guided by pharmacokinetic-guided dose selection. A blood test, the QMS Omecamtiv Mecarbil Immunoassay (the OM Test) was used to measure plasma levels of omecamtiv mecarbil in each patient in order to guide selection of the appropriate maintenance dose.

The primary composite endpoint of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial was time to CV death or first heart failure event (heart failure hospitalization and other urgent treatment for heart failure). Secondary endpoints were: time to CV death, patient reported outcomes (measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] Total Symptom Score [TSS]), time to first heart failure hospitalization and time to all-cause death.

About Omecamtiv Mecarbil and the Phase 3 Clinical Trials Program
Omecamtiv mecarbil is an investigational selective cardiac myosin activator, the first of a novel class of myotropes1 designed to directly target the contractile mechanisms of the heart, binding to and recruiting more cardiac myosin heads to interact with actin during systole. Preclinical research has shown that omecamtiv mecarbil increases cardiac contractility without increasing intracellular myocyte calcium concentrations or myocardial oxygen consumption.3-5 Cardiac myosin is the cytoskeletal motor protein in the cardiac muscle cell that is directly responsible for converting chemical energy into the mechanical force resulting in cardiac contraction. 

Omecamtiv mecarbil is being developed for the potential treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) under a collaboration between Amgen and Cytokinetics, with funding and strategic support from Servier. Omecamtiv mecarbil is the subject of a comprehensive Phase 3 clinical trials program composed of GALACTIC-HF and METEORIC-HF (Multicenter Exercise Tolerance Evaluation of Omecamtiv Mecarbil Related to Increased Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo on exercise capacity.

About Heart Failure
Heart failure is a grievous condition that affects more than 64 million people worldwide6 about half of whom have reduced left ventricular function.7,8 It is the leading cause of hospitalization and readmission in people age 65 and older.9,10 Despite broad use of standard treatments and advances in care, the prognosis for patients with heart failure is poor.11 An estimated one in five people over the age of 40 are at risk of developing heart failure, and approximately 50 percent of people diagnosed with heart failure will die within five years of initial hospitalization.12,13

About Cytokinetics and Amgen Collaboration
In 2006, Cytokinetics and Amgen entered into a strategic alliance to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics designed to activate the cardiac sarcomere for the potential treatment of heart failure. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being developed by Amgen in collaboration with Cytokinetics, with funding and strategic support from Servier.

Amgen Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration or potential collaboration in pursuit of therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 (including statements regarding such collaboration’s, or our own, ability to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 or antibodies against targets other than the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, and/or to produce any such antibodies to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19), or the Otezla® (apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.

Amgen’s results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen’s products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen’s research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen’s business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen’s business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for Amgen’s manufacturing activities, the distribution of Amgen’s products, the commercialization of Amgen’s product candidates, and Amgen’s clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on Amgen’s product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen’s products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen’s distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen’s products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen’s efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology Amgen has acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen’s systems and Amgen’s data. Amgen’s stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen’s business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to Amgen’s product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.

50117,Regeneron Seeks the US FDA's EUA for REGN-COV2 Antibody Combination to Treat COVID-19,Regeneron Asks FDA to Approve Emergency Use of REGN-COV2 for COVID-19,"Regeneron has submitted a request to the US FDA seeking EUA for its REGN-COV2 investigational Ab regimen to treat COVID-19. If EUA is granted, the US govt. has committed to making REGN-COV2 available in the US at no cost and would be responsible for its distribution
 The company reported that there are doses available for ~50,000 patients and expects to have doses available for 300,000 patients in total within the next few months
 REGN-COV2 is a combination of two mAbs, REGN10933 & REGN10987, designed to block the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. The company reported that a single 8g dose of REGN-COV2 was given to President Donald Trump following a compassionate-use request from doctors as part of a treatment regimen","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said that it submitted a request to the FDA seeking emergency-use authorization for its REGN-COV2 investigational antibody combination for the treatment of COVID-19. REGN-COV2 is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies, REGN10933 and REGN10987, which has been designed to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.

The disclosure came the same day that Eli Lilly announced that it submitted an EUA request to the FDA for its neutralising IgG1 monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555 for use in higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Available in US at no cost
According to Regeneron, under an agreement with the US government, if an EUA is granted, the government has committed to making REGN-COV2 available to the American people at no cost and would be responsible for its distribution. The company noted that currently there are doses available for approximately 50,000 patients, while it expects to have doses available for 300,000 patients in total within the next few months.

Regeneron reported early study results last month showing that the addition of REGN-COV2 to standard-of-care reduced viral load as well as the time to symptom alleviation in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, the company more recently confirmed that a single 8g dose of REGN-COV2 was given to President Donald Trump following a compassionate-use request from his doctors as part of a treatment regimen also including Gilead Sciences’ antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) and the steroid dexamethasone.

Trump touts REGN-COV2
Following treatment and amid his ongoing recovery from COVID-19, Trump said REGN-COV2 was “the key” to his positive outcome. “I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president,” he remarked, adding that “I think we’re going to work it so you’re going to get [REGN-COV2 and LY-CoV555] and you’re going to get ’em free,” with distribution handled by the military.

Further, Trump’s doctor said that a recent blood test showed that the president had detectable levels of SARS CoV-2 antibodies, which had not been present in a test prior to receiving REGN-COV2. Regeneron noted that it is not possible for the blood test to distinguish between antibodies made by Trump himself and those from REGN-COV2. Company spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie said that given the volume of antibodies delivered in REGN-COV2, and the timing of the tests, “it is likely that the second test is detecting REGN-COV2 antibodies.”",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Website-Size-6-2.jpg,COVID-19|Regulatory,0,0,Approve|COVID-19|Emergency|Regeneron|REGN-COV2|Seeks|Use|USFDA,publish,10/9/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/regeneron-asks-fda-to-approve-emergency-use-of-regn-cov2-for-covid-19/,https://pharmashots.com/50117/regeneron-seeks-the-us-fdas-eua-for-regn-cov2-antibody-combination-to-treat-covid-19/
50125,Takeda Signs ~$1B Pact with Arrowhead for ARO-AAT Targeting Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Associated Liver Disease,Takeda and Arrowhead Collaborate to Co-Develop and Co-Commercialize ARO-AAT for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Associated Liver Disease,"Arrowhead to receive ~$300M up front, ~$740M as development, regulatory and commercial milestones and is eligible to receive royalties of 20-25% on net sales
 If approved, the companies will co-develop ARO-AAT and co-commercialize it in the US, under 50/50 profit sharing structure. Additionally, Takeda will lead the global commercialization strategy and get an exclusive license to commercialize the therapy outside the US
 ARO-AAT is designed to knock down the hepatic production of the Z-AAT protein and is potential first-in-class therapy designed to treat the underlying cause of liver disease associated with AATD","Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) and Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARWR) today announced a collaboration and licensing agreement to develop ARO-AAT, a Phase 2 investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapy in development to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin-associated liver disease (AATLD). ARO-AAT is a potential first-in-class therapy designed to reduce the production of mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin protein, the cause of AATLD progression.

Under the terms of the agreement, Takeda and Arrowhead will co-develop ARO-AAT which, if approved, will be co-commercialized in the United States under a 50/50 profit-sharing structure. Outside the U.S., Takeda will lead the global commercialization strategy and receive an exclusive license to commercialize ARO-AAT with Arrowhead eligible to receive tiered royalties of 20-25% on net sales. Arrowhead will receive an upfront payment of $300 million and is eligible to receive potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to $740 million. Closing of the transaction is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S.

“AAT-associated liver disease is a devastating condition for which there are no approved therapies. With its RNAi-based mechanism of action, ARO-AAT has the potential to treat the underlying cause of AATLD, thereby helping patients avoid the need for liver transplantation and associated co-morbidities,” said Asit Parikh, M.D., Ph.D., Head, Gastroenterology Therapeutic Area Unit at Takeda. “We are excited to collaborate with Arrowhead to bring forward this exciting late-stage liver asset for the Alpha-1 community as part of our growing GI portfolio.”

“Takeda’s global presence and experience with payers and regulators in the rare disease and GI therapy space, combined with its long history serving the Alpha-1 community make it the ideal partner for ARO-AAT. It is well-positioned to work with the patient and medical community to help meet the severe unmet need of patients with Alpha-1 liver disease,” said Christopher Anzalone, Ph.D., President and CEO at Arrowhead. “This agreement also supports our strategy of using partnering selectively to continue to invest in our Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiMTM) platform and the growing pipeline of RNAi therapeutics targeting diverse tissue types, while focusing our commercial organization on opportunities in two key areas of cardiometabolic and pulmonary.”

 

About Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Associated Liver Disease
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Associated Deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic disorder associated with liver disease in children and adults and pulmonary disease in adults. AATD is estimated to affect 1 per 3,000-5,000 people in the United States and 1 per 2,500 in Europe. The protein AAT is primarily synthesized and secreted by liver hepatocytes. Its function is to inhibit enzymes that can break down normal connective tissue. The most common disease variant, the Z mutant, has a single amino acid substitution that results in improper folding of the protein. The mutant protein cannot be effectively secreted and accumulates in globules inside the hepatocytes. This triggers continuous hepatocyte injury, leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Individuals with the homozygous PiZZ genotype have severe deficiency of functional AAT leading to pulmonary disease and liver disease. Lung disease is frequently treated with AAT augmentation therapy. However, augmentation therapy does nothing to treat liver disease, and there is no specific therapy for hepatic manifestations. There is a significant unmet need as liver transplant, with its attendant morbidity and mortality, is currently the only available cure.

 

About ARO-AAT
ARO-AAT is designed to knock down the hepatic production of the mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin (Z-AAT) protein, the cause of progressive liver disease in AATD patients. Reducing production of the inflammatory Z-AAT protein is expected to halt the progression of liver disease and potentially allow it to regenerate and repair.

 

Takeda in Gastroenterology
We believe that GI and liver diseases are not just life disrupting conditions, but diseases that can impact a patient’s quality of life.[i],[ii] Beyond a fundamental need for effective treatment options, we understand that improving patients’ lives also depends on their needs being recognized. With nearly 30 years of experience in gastroenterology, Takeda has made significant strides in addressing GI patient needs with treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), acid-related diseases, short bowel syndrome (SBS), and motility disorders. We are making significant strides toward closing the gap on new areas of unmet needs for patients who have celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, alpha-1 antitrypsin-associated liver disease, Crohn’s disease, and acute pancreatitis, among others. Together with researchers, patient groups and more, we are working to advance scientific research and clinical medicine in GI.

NEU-ISENBURG, Germany & FRANKFURT, Germany & NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– The German Breast Group (GBG) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the collaborative Phase 3 PENELOPE-B trial did not meet the primary endpoint of improved invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor-negative (HER2-) early breast cancer (eBC) who have residual invasive disease after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. No unexpected safety signals were observed.

PENELOPE-B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study comparing one year of palbociclib plus at least five years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy to placebo plus at least five years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy. The trial is sponsored by the GBG as part of a clinical research collaboration with Pfizer and other study groups.

“Reducing the risk of disease recurrence in patients who have residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a complex clinical challenge,” said Professor Sibylle Loibl, Chair of GBG. “This unique trial was made possible through the collaboration and support from all the research partners involved. Despite this outcome, we believe that key learnings will emerge from the large number of biomarkers being analyzed from collected tumor tissue, which will help inform future breast cancer research.”

“This is the first randomized Phase 3 study to establish mature iDFS results for a CDK4/6 inhibitor as part of the adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer. While we are disappointed with this result, we look forward to continuing to work with our research partners to understand subgroup data and how these could inform the development of our next-generation CDK inhibitors in early breast cancer,” said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We are proud of the transformative impact IBRANCE has had on the treatment of HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer – a vastly different treatment setting than early breast cancer. Our commitment to the metastatic patient community is as strong as ever as we continue to generate new data, including the most extensive body of real-world evidence for a CDK 4/6 inhibitor.”

Detailed findings from PENELOPE-B will be presented at an upcoming medical congress.

About the PENELOPE-B Study

PENELOPE-B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study comparing one year of palbociclib plus at least five years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy to placebo plus at least five years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy in 1,250 women with HR+, HER2- eBC at high risk of recurrence who have residual invasive disease after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients in the trial scored 3 or higher (or 2 if there were lymph node metastases at the time of surgery) on the clinical-pathologic stage – estrogen/grade (CPS-EG). The CPS-EG is a validated risk assessment tool combining: clinical stage before neoadjuvant treatment, pathological stage after neoadjuvant treatment, grading and estrogen-receptor status. The trial is sponsored by the GBG as part of a clinical research collaboration with other study groups, including ABCSG, AGO-B, ANZBCTG, BIG, CCTG, GEICAM, LACOG, IBCSG, ICORG, ISPy-2, JBCRG, KCSG, NSABP, Unicancer and Pfizer.

More than 190 clinical sites in 12 countries around the globe participated in PENELOPE-B. The study opened in November 2013 and closed recruitment on December 31, 2017.

About IBRANCE® (palbociclib) 125 mg tablets and capsules

IBRANCE is an oral inhibitor of CDKs 4 and 6,1 which are key regulators of the cell cycle that trigger cellular progression.2,3 In the U.S., IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine based therapy in postmenopausal women or in men; or with fulvestrant in patients with disease progression following endocrine therapy.

IBRANCE currently is approved in more than 95 countries and has been prescribed to nearly 340,000 patients globally. IBRANCE is not indicated for early breast cancer.

The full U.S. Prescribing Information for the IBRANCE tablets and the IBRANCE capsules can be found here and here.

IMPORTANT IBRANCE®(palbociclib) SAFETY INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-2 (80%) and PALOMA-3 (83%). In PALOMA-2, Grade 3 (56%) or 4 (10%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. In PALOMA-3, Grade 3 (55%) or Grade 4 (11%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 1.8% of patients exposed to IBRANCE across PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA-3. Inform patients to promptly report any fever.

Monitor complete blood count prior to starting IBRANCE, at the beginning of each cycle, on Day 15 of first 2 cycles and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.

Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, including IBRANCE when taken in combination with endocrine therapy. Across clinical trials (PALOMA-1, PALOMA-2, PALOMA-3), 1.0% of IBRANCE-treated patients had ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.1% had Grade 3 or 4, and no fatal cases were reported. Additional cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in the post-marketing setting, with fatalities reported.

Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. hypoxia, cough, dyspnea). In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms and are suspected to have developed pneumonitis, interrupt IBRANCE immediately and evaluate the patient. Permanently discontinue IBRANCE in patients with severe ILD or pneumonitis.

Based on the mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. IBRANCE may impair fertility in males and has the potential to cause genotoxicity. Advise male patients to consider sperm preservation before taking IBRANCE. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Advise women not to breastfeed during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.

The most common adverse reactions(≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-2 for IBRANCE plus letrozole vs placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (80% vs 6%), infections (60% vs 42%), leukopenia (39% vs 2%), fatigue (37% vs 28%), nausea (35% vs 26%), alopecia (33% vs 16%), stomatitis (30% vs 14%), diarrhea (26% vs 19%), anemia (24% vs 9%), rash (18% vs 12%), asthenia (17% vs 12%), thrombocytopenia (16% vs 1%), vomiting (16% vs 17%), decreased appetite (15% vs 9%), dry skin (12% vs 6%), pyrexia (12% vs 9%), and dysgeusia (10% vs 5%).

The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in PALOMA-2 for IBRANCE plus letrozole vs placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (66% vs 2%), leukopenia (25% vs 0%), infections (7% vs 3%), and anemia (5% vs 2%).

Lab abnormalities of any grade occurring in PALOMA-2 for IBRANCE plus letrozole vs placebo plus letrozole were decreased WBC (97% vs 25%), decreased neutrophils (95% vs 20%), anemia (78% vs 42%), decreased platelets (63% vs 14%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (52% vs 34%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (43% vs 30%).

The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-3 for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant were neutropenia (83% vs 4%), leukopenia (53% vs 5%), infections (47% vs 31%), fatigue (41% vs 29%), nausea (34% vs 28%), anemia (30% vs 13%), stomatitis (28% vs 13%), diarrhea (24% vs 19%), thrombocytopenia (23% vs 0%), vomiting (19% vs 15%), alopecia (18% vs 6%), rash (17% vs 6%), decreased appetite (16% vs 8%), and pyrexia (13% vs 5%).

The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in PALOMA-3 for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant were neutropenia (66% vs 1%) and leukopenia (31% vs 2%).

Lab abnormalities of any grade occurring in PALOMA-3 for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant were decreased WBC (99% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (96% vs 14%), anemia (78% vs 40%), decreased platelets (62% vs 10%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (43% vs 48%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (36% vs 34%).

Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors. If patients must be administered a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of IBRANCE and should be avoided. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers. The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may need to be reduced as IBRANCE may increase their exposure.

50158,AstraZeneca Advances its AZD7442 in Two P-III Clinical Studies for COVID-19,COVID-19 Long-Acting AntiBody (LAAB) combination AZD7442 rapidly advances into Phase III clinical trials,"The two studies of AZD7442 will enroll ~6,000 adults for the prevention of COVID-19 in and outside the US, expected to begin in next wk. with additional trials enrolling ~4,000 adults for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
 The first study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZD7442 to prevent infection for up to 12mos. in ~5,000 participants while the second trial will assess post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-emptive treatment in ~1,100 participants
 AstraZeneca has received ~$486M from US Govt. and plans to supply ~100,000 doses and can acquire other 1M doses. AZD7442 is a combination of 2 LAABs derived from convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection","Two trials of AZD7442 will enrol over 6,000 adults for the prevention of COVID-19 with additional trials enrolling ~4,000 adults for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections
US Government to invest ~$486m for development and supply of up to 100,000 doses and can acquire another one million doses
AstraZeneca’s long-acting antibody (LAAB) combination, AZD7442, will advance into two Phase III clinical trials in more than 6,000 participants at sites in and outside the US that are due to begin in the next weeks. The LAABs have been engineered with AstraZeneca’s proprietary half-life extension technology to increase the durability of the therapy for six to 12 months following a single administration. The combination of two LAABs is also designed to reduce the risk of resistance developed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The Company has received support of around $486m from the US Government for the development and supply of AZD7442 under an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense.

One trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZD7442 to prevent infection for up to 12 months, in approximately 5,000 participants. The second trial will evaluate post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-emptive treatment in approximately 1,100 participants.

AstraZeneca is planning additional trials to evaluate AZD7442 in approximately 4,000 patients for the treatment of COVID-19.

AstraZeneca plans to supply up to 100,000 doses starting towards the end of 2020 and the US Government can acquire up to an additional one million doses in 2021 under a separate agreement.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “This agreement with the US Government will help accelerate the development of our long-acting antibody combination which has the potential to provide immediate and long-lasting effect in both preventing and treating COVID-19 infections. We will be evaluating the LAAB combination in different settings from prophylaxis, to outpatient treatment to hospitalisation, with a focus on helping the most vulnerable people.”

LAABs mimic natural antibodies and have the potential to treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected with the virus, as well as to be given as a preventative intervention prior to exposure to the virus. A LAAB combination could be complementary to vaccines as a prophylactic agent, e.g. for people for whom a vaccine may not be appropriate or to provide added protection for high-risk populations. It could also be used to treat people who have been infected.

Today’s agreement builds on previous funding of more than $25m from US government agencies BARDA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for the discovery and evaluation of the monoclonal antibodies, as well as the Phase I clinical trial started in August 20201 to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD7442 in healthy individuals.

Financial considerations
The agreement is not anticipated to impact the Company’s financial guidance for 2020 as the US Government funding is being offset by expenses to progress the clinical trials of AZD7442 as well as manufacturing process and upscaling costs. Should the Phase III trials prove successful and AZD7442 become an approved medicine, the Company anticipates providing the medicine at commercial terms during and after the current coronavirus pandemic.

AZD7442
AZD7442 is a combination of two LAABs derived from convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and licensed to AstraZeneca in June 2020, the LAABs were optimised by AstraZeneca with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor binding. The half-life extended LAABs should afford six to 12 months of protection from COVID-19.2-5 The reduced Fc receptor binding aims to minimise the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease – a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies promote, rather than inhibit, infection and/or disease.6

In a recent Nature publication, the LAABs were shown in pre-clinical experiments to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to host cells and protect against infection in cell and animal models of disease.7

About Malignant Lymphoma

Malignant lymphoma is one of the most common hematological malignancies in China. It is one of the top ten malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality. In recent years, the incidence of malignant lymphoma has been rising. According to histopathology, lymphoma can be divided into Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), of which NHL accounts for the majority. NHL is a general term for a series of related but different lymphoid malignant tumors. Most (80-85%) originates from B cells. The rest originate from T cells or NK cells. More than 95% of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells express CD20. The incidence of NHL increases with age. The most common type of NHL in China is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), accounting for 40-50% (about 30-40% in Western countries). DLBCL is a moderately malignant to highly malignant invasive lymphoma that progresses rapidly and leads to the death of patients within a few months without treatment.

About HALPRYZA® (rituximab injection)

HALPRYZA® is rituximab injection and a recombinant human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody drug. Rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on the surface of B lymphocytes and mediates complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Normal and malignant B cells are targeted for destruction by the antibody, thereby achieving anti-tumor and immunosuppressive therapeutic effects.

In addition to C3G, iptacopan is in parallel development for a number of other renal conditions with complement system involvement where significant unmet needs exist, including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and membranous nephropathy.

Novartis is also investigating iptacopan in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Following positive Phase II data presented at the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) congress in August10, a randomized, active-comparator controlled open-label Phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iptacopan in PNH patients with residual anemia despite treatment with anti-C5 antibody therapy is planned to start in Dec 2020.11

Iptacopan has the potential to become the first alternative pathway inhibitor to slow disease progression in a number of complement driven diseases. Based on the preliminary data from the ph2 trial, Iptacopan has received orphan designations by FDA and EMA in C3G.

50188,Janssen Reports Results of Tremfya (guselkumab) in Interim Analysis of P-II GALAXI 1 Study for Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease,TREMFYA® (guselkumab) Induces Clinical and Endoscopic Improvements in Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn’s Disease based on Interim Results from Phase 2 Study,"The P-II GALAXI 1 study involves assessing of Tremfya vs PBO in patients with mod. to severely active CD with intolerance to conventional therapies. In interim analyses, patients were randomized equally into 5 arms, with Tremfya (200/600/1200 mg (IV) @0, 4 & 8wks. respectively or with ustekinumab, dosed at ~6mg/kg (IV) @0wk. and dosed 90 mg (SC) @8wks. or PBO
 @12wks. (Tremfya vs PBO), reductions in CDAI (154.1, -144.3, -149.5 vs -36.0); patients achieving clinical remission vs PBO (CDAI<150): (54.0%, 56.0%, 50.0% vs 15.7%); clinical remission among conventional therapy failures & among patients who had previously failed biologic therapy, (61.6% vs 18.5% & 45.5% vs 12.5%) respectively
 @12wks, Tremfya induced greater improvement across key clinical and endoscopic outcome measures, with a safety profile consistent with approved indications. Tremfya is a mAb that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of (IL)-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor","SPRING HOUSE, Pa., Oct. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced Phase 2 interim data from the GALAXI 1 study, which showed TREMFYA® (guselkumab) demonstrated results at week 12 in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD) with inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapies and/or biologics.1 At 12 weeks, TREMFYA induced significantly greater improvements compared to placebo across key clinical and endoscopic outcome measures, with a safety profile consistent with approved indications.1 TREMFYA is not currently approved for the treatment of CD in the U.S.2

These new data are being presented today as an oral presentation (Abstract OP089) at the 28th United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week, which is conducting its annual congress virtually.1

“While there have been substantial treatment breakthroughs in Crohn’s disease, there are still patients who are not gaining benefit from any of the currently approved mechanisms of action for their symptoms,” said lead study investigator William J. Sandborni, M.D., Chief of Gastroenterology, Professor of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, who is delivering the oral presentation virtually at UEG Week. “I am encouraged by these early data, which show that TREMFYA across three different dosing groups induced a significant response in key clinical and endoscopic outcome measures in Crohn’s disease.”

GALAXI 1 evaluated the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA compared with placebo in CD. The interim analyses reported results through week 12 from the first 250 patients enrolled. Approximately 50 percent of patients had previously failed biologic therapy; and baseline disease characteristics were consistent with moderately to severely active CD (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index [CDAI], mean 306.6; Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease [SES-CD], median 11.0). Patients were randomized equally into five treatment arms, including treatment with TREMFYA dosed at 200, 600 or 1200 mg intravenously (IV) at weeks 0, 4 and 8, respectively; or treatment with ustekinumab dosed at ~6mg/kg IV at week 0 and then dosed at 90 mg subcutaneously (SC) at week 8; or placebo.1

At week 12, there were significantly greater reductions from baseline in the CDAI observed in each TREMFYA group (200, 600 or 1200 mg IV doses) compared with placebo (Least Squares [LS] means: -154.1, -144.3, -149.5 versus -36.0, respectively; all p<0.001). A significantly higher proportion of patients assigned to each TREMFYA dose achieved clinical remission compared with placebo (CDAI<150): 54.0 percent, 56.0 percent, 50.0 percent, respectively, versus 15.7 percent (p<0.001). Among conventional therapy failures, 61.6 percent in the TREMFYA-combined group versus 18.5 percent treated with placebo achieved clinical remission at week 12. Among patients who had previously failed biologic therapy, 45.5 percent in the TREMFYA-combined group compared with 12.5 percent in the placebo group achieved clinical remission at week 12.1

Furthermore, at week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with TREMFYA achieved clinical response (p<0.001), patient reported outcome (PRO)-2 remission (p<0.001), clinical-biomarker response (p<0.001), and endoscopic response (p<0.001) compared with patients treated with placebo. Endoscopic healing is an important outcome for long-term disease control; 37.3 percent of patients in the TREMFYA-combined group compared with 11.8 percent in the placebo group achieved endoscopic response after only 12 weeks of induction treatment (p<0.001).1

“For patients living with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, including those who have not had an adequate response or have intolerance to other therapies, these results show that TREMFYA may play an important role as a new treatment option pending results from the ongoing registration trials,” said Jan Wehkamp, M.D., Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Although more research is needed, we are encouraged by the data and the potential role for selective IL-23 inhibition in helping patients manage their Crohn’s disease symptoms and treating the underlying disease process.”

TREMFYA demonstrated a safety profile consistent with that established from prior clinical trials across approved indications. Observed adverse events (AEs) were generally similar amongst treatment groups and placebo through week 12. In the TREMFYA 200, 600, 1200 mg IV and placebo treatment groups, serious AEs occurred in 4 percent, 4 percent, 2 percent and 4 percent, and serious infections occurred in 2 percent, 0 percent, 0 percent and 0 percent of patients, respectively. There were no reported deaths in TREMFYA-treated patients, and no TREMFYA-treated patient had active tuberculosis, serious hypersensitivity reactions or malignancies.1

About the GALAXI 1 trial1,3
GALAXI 1 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 dose-ranging study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA® (guselkumab) in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease with inadequate response/intolerance to conventional therapies (corticosteroid, immunosuppressive) and/or biologics (TNF antagonist, vedolizumab). Patients will receive treatment through up to 3 years.

Interim analyses at week 12 evaluated the key outcomes of change in CDAI score from baseline, clinical remission (CDAI<150), clinical response (decrease from baseline in CDAI ≥100 or CDAI<150), PRO-2 remission (abdominal pain mean daily score ≤1 and mean daily stool frequency score ≤3), clinical biomarker response (clinical response and ≥50% reduction from baseline in C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin), endoscopic response (≥50% improvement from baseline in the SES-CD), and safety in patients treated with TREMFYA compared with placebo. The efficacy and safety of the reference arm (ustekinumab) compared with placebo was also evaluated and demonstrated.

About Crohn’s disease (CD)
CD is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects an estimated 3 million Americans.4 CD is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with no known cause, but the disease is associated with abnormalities of the immune system that could be triggered by a genetic predisposition, diet or other environmental factors.5 Symptoms of CD can vary but often include abdominal pain and tenderness, frequent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss and fever.5,6 There is currently no cure for CD.6

About TREMFYA® (guselkumab)
Developed by Janssen, TREMFYA® is the first approved fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor.2 TREMFYA® is approved in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet [UV] light).2 It is approved in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Brazil and Ecuador for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. IL-23 is an important driver of the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis.7

All patients completing 44wks. were eligible to enter the LTE program, continuing their current regimen ~252wks.
 50%+ patients were randomized to q8w dosing and continued to receive this dosage in the LTE study, maintained CR (57%) and remission (55 %) through 5 yrs. of treatment while (93%) were steroid-free. Among patients who had prior exposure to & failed to TNF-α biologics, clinical remission (59% & 44%) respectively
 Stelara is a fully human mAb & is the first and only biologic treatment to selectively inhibit the (IL)-12 and IL-23 pathways and is approved in the US for multiple diseases","SPRING HOUSE, Pa., Oct. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced new, final five-year data from the Phase 3 IM-UNITI open-label, long-term extension (LTE) study which showed treatment of STELARA® (ustekinumab) in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD) maintained long-term remission1 through five years.2,i

These data are being presented today as an oral presentation (Abstract OP110) at the 28th United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week, which is conducting its annual congress virtually.2

“Crohn’s disease is among the most debilitating forms of inflammatory bowel disease, disrupting the lives of millions of patients worldwide,” said lead study investigator William J. Sandbornii, M.D., Chief of Gastroenterology, Professor of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, who is delivering the oral presentation virtually at UEG Week. “Results from the IM-UNITI study showed that patients were able to maintain response with STELARA treatment through five years. Notably, for those patients in clinical remission, the majority (greater than 90 percent) who received continuous treatment with q8w STELARA were steroid-free at five years.”

The key findings showed more than half of the patients with moderately to severely active CD who were randomized to subcutaneous (SC) STELARA every 8 weeks (q8w) and continued to receive this dosage in the LTE study maintained clinical response3 (57 percent) and remission (55 percent) through five years of treatment. Of these patients in clinical remission, 93 percent were steroid-free.2

Additionally, among the subgroup of these patients who had never previously been exposed to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) biologics, 59 percent were in clinical remission after five years of receiving SC STELARA q8w maintenance treatment. Further, among the subgroup of these patients who had previously failed (i.e. were refractory to) or who were intolerant to anti TNF-α therapy, 44 percent were in clinical remission after five years of receiving SC STELARA q8w maintenance treatment. Approximately half (51 percent, [290/567]) of all patients (randomized and assigned) who entered the LTE study completed their final dosing visit.2

Through five years, the event rates (per one hundred patient years) for adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and serious infections for the q8w STELARA group were generally comparable to the event rates in the placebo group. Antibody to STELARA rates through week 272 remained low, occurring in 5 percent of patients assigned to receive STELARA in the maintenance study and continuously receiving the approved 90 mg SC q8w regimen in the LTE. No new safety signals were observed.2

“Crohn’s disease is a chronic, lifelong condition, so it’s important to understand the long-term outcomes of therapies in order to effectively address the disease,” said Jan Wehkamp, M.D., Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “These results from the LTE study with STELARA bring us further insights on the long-term management of this chronic disease.”

Janssen is presenting a total of 16 abstracts at this year’s UEG Week congress of which seven are oral presentations.

About the IM-UNITI trial4
IM-UNITI, a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, evaluated the efficacy and safety of STELARA maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. Patients who had responded to a single intravenous dose of STELARA in the UNITI-1 or UNITI-2 induction studies were randomized equally to receive maintenance SC STELARA 90 mg q8w or q12w, or placebo. There were 1,281 patients enrolled in the maintenance study.2 In randomized patients who met loss of response criteria between weeks 8–32, a one-time dose adjustment to 90 mg q8w occurred. All patients completing week 44 were eligible to enter the long-term extension program, continuing their current regimen up to week 252.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
STELARA® is a prescription medicine that affects your immune system. STELARA® can increase your chance of having serious side effects including:

Serious Infections
STELARA® may lower your ability to fight infections and may increase your risk of infections. While taking STELARA®, some people have serious infections, which may require hospitalization, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses.

Your doctor should check you for TB before starting STELARA® and watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with STELARA®.
If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated for TB before and during treatment with STELARA®.
You should not start taking STELARA® if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay.

Before starting STELARA®, tell your doctor if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as:
fever, sweats, or chills
muscle aches
cough
shortness of breath
blood in phlegm
weight loss
warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body
diarrhea or stomach pain
burning when you urinate or urinate more often than normal
feel very tired
are being treated for an infection.
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back.
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB.
After starting STELARA®, call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of an infection (see above). STELARA® can make you more likely to get infections or make an infection that you have worse. People who have a genetic problem where the body does not make any of the proteins interleukin 12 (IL–12) and interleukin 23 (IL–23) are at a higher risk for certain serious infections that can spread throughout the body and cause death. People who take STELARA® may also be more likely to get these infections.

Cancers
STELARA® may decrease the activity of your immune system and increase your risk for certain types of cancer. Tell your doctor if you have ever had any type of cancer. Some people who had risk factors for skin cancer developed certain types of skin cancers while receiving STELARA®. Tell your doctor if you have any new skin growths.

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)
RPLS is a rare condition that affects the brain and can cause death. The cause of RPLS is not known. If RPLS is found early and treated, most people recover. Tell your doctor right away if you have any new or worsening medical problems including: headache, seizures, confusion, and vision problems.

Serious Allergic Reactions
Serious allergic reactions can occur. Stop using STELARA® and get medical help right away if you have any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction such as: feeling faint, swelling of your face, eyelids, tongue, or throat, chest tightness, or skin rash.

Lung Inflammation
Cases of lung inflammation have happened in some people who receive STELARA® and may be serious. These lung problems may need to be treated in a hospital. Tell your doctor right away if you develop shortness of breath or a cough that doesn’t go away during treatment with STELARA®.

Before receiving STELARA®, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have any of the conditions or symptoms listed above for serious infections, cancers, or RPLS.
ever had an allergic reaction to STELARA® or any of its ingredients. Ask your doctor if you are not sure.
are allergic to latex. The needle cover on the prefilled syringe contains latex.
have recently received or are scheduled to receive an immunization (vaccine). People who take STELARA® should not receive live vaccines. Tell your doctor if anyone in your house needs a live vaccine. The viruses used in some types of live vaccines can spread to people with a weakened immune system, and can cause serious problems. You should not receive the BCG vaccine during the one year before receiving STELARA® or one year after you stop receiving STELARA®.
have any new or changing lesions within psoriasis areas or on normal skin.
are receiving or have received allergy shots, especially for serious allergic reactions.
receive or have received phototherapy for your psoriasis.
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if STELARA® can harm your unborn baby. You and your doctor should decide if you will receive STELARA®.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is thought that STELARA® passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you receive STELARA®.
Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over–the–counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

When prescribed STELARA®:

Use STELARA® exactly as your doctor tells you to.
STELARA® is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of your doctor. In children 6 years and older, it is recommended that STELARA® be administered by a healthcare provider. If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver may give your injections of STELARA® at home, you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject STELARA®. Your doctor will determine the right dose of STELARA® for you, the amount for each injection, and how often you should receive it. Do not try to inject STELARA® yourself until you or your caregiver have been shown how to inject STELARA® by your doctor or nurse.
Common side effects of STELARA® include: nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose, upper respiratory infections, fever, headache, tiredness, itching, nausea and vomiting, redness at the injection site, vaginal yeast infections, urinary tract infections, sinus infection, stomach pain, diarrhea, and joint pain. These are not all of the possible side effects with STELARA®. Tell your doctor about any side effect that you experience. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

Please read the full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for STELARA® and discuss any questions you have with your doctor.

50218,Takeda Reports Results of Entyvio (vedolizumab) in Interim Analysis from VISIBLE OLE Study for Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis,Safety and Efficacy of Subcutaneous Entyvio® (Vedolizumab) Sustained During Long-term Maintenance Therapy in Adults with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis,"The ongoing P-IIIb VISIBLE OLE study involves assessing of Entyvio (SC) in adult patients with UC or CD, following enrolment and participation in the VISIBLE 1 (UC) or VISIBLE 2 (CD) studies. Patients who completed the maintenance period up to 52wks. (randomized completers) or who achieved clinical response @14wks. (non-randomized 14wks. responders) after a third IV infusion @6wks., received Entyvio (SC, 108mg, q2w)
 Interim analysis from VISIBLE OLE study showed long-term findings consistent with the known safety profile of vedolizumab with maintained rates of clinical remission and corticosteroid-free clinical remission
 Entyvio is the first maintenance biological therapy approved across the EU in both IV and SC formulations to treat moderately to severely active UC or CD. VISIBLE OLE results presented at UEG Week Virtual 2020 congress","Osaka, JAPAN, October 12, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced interim results from the VISIBLE open-label extension (OLE) study on the long-term safety and efficacy of maintenance treatment with the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of the gut-selective biologic Entyvio® (vedolizumab) in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).
In evaluating the primary safety endpoint of the trial, interim data of the UC patient population showed that following two years of maintenance therapy with vedolizumab SC, long-term safety findings were consistent with the known safety profile of vedolizumab.1 Patients also continued to demonstrate clinical benefit from treatment, through maintenance of clinical remission* and corticosteroid-free clinical remission** rates, the clinical efficacy outcomes of the trial.1 These data were announced in an oral presentation at the UEG Week Virtual 2020 congress.

VISIBLE OLE is an ongoing open-label, phase 3b, multinational, multicenter study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of vedolizumab SC in adult patients with UC or CD, following enrolment and participation in the VISIBLE 1 (UC) or VISIBLE 2 (CD) studies.1,2 Participants who completed the maintenance period up to week 52 (randomized completers), or who achieved clinical response at week 14 after a third vedolizumab IV infusion at week 6 (non-randomized week 14 responders), received vedolizumab SC 108 mg every two weeks.1,2 Interim data from the VISIBLE OLE study in the UC patient population demonstrated that adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of vedolizumab.1 During two years of maintenance treatment,adverse events occurred in 69% of patients with UC, with disease exacerbations (18%), nasopharyngitis (11%), upper respiratory tract infection (9%), and anemia (7%) reported most frequently.1 Injection site reactions were reported in 4.5% of patients and all were mild or moderate in severity.1 Serious adverse events occurred in 14% of patients, with no cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and no deaths.1

In randomized completers, rates of clinical remission and corticosteroid-free clinical remission were maintained up to week 108 (week 6: 71.0% [n=49/69] and week 108: 68.9% [n=42/61], respectively; week 52: 78.3% [n=18/23] to week 108: 70.0% [n=14/20], respectively).1 In non-randomized week 14 responders, the comparative rates were 62.6% [n=67/107] at week 14 and 33.3% [n=31/93] at week 110 for clinical remission, and 24.5% [n=12/49] at week 54 and 25.0% [n=11/44] at week 110 for corticosteroid-free clinical remission.1

“These latest safety and effectiveness data for vedolizumab SC provide additional support/data that the benefits received from subcutaneous vedolizumab are sustained during long-term maintenance therapy,” said Asit Parikh, MD PhD, Head of Takeda’s Gastroenterology Therapeutic Area Unit. “Entyvio® SC was approved by the European Commission in May 2020, offering greater choice on mode of administration in line with the diverse medical needs and preferences of patients, plus the option of home-administration outside of the medical setting. Takeda’s commitment to gastrointestinal innovation continues and we are working to develop a needle-free jet injector application that would broaden choice for patients even further.”

* Clinical remission is defined as a partial Mayo score of ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 point1
** Corticosteroid-free clinical remission is defined as patients using oral corticosteroids at baseline (week 0) who have discontinued oral corticosteroids and are in clinical remission1

About the VISIBLE Clinical Trial Program
The VISIBLE clinical trial program aims to assess the efficacy and safety of a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of vedolizumab as maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD).

The VISIBLE program consists of three phase 3 studies involving over 1,000 UC and CD patients which includes two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies examining the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission at week 52, and an open-label extension study to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of vedolizumab SC.2,3,4

About Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).5 Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, with CD potentially progressing over time.6,7 UC only involves the large intestine as opposed to CD which can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus.8,9 CD can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall while UC only involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.8,9 UC commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort, loose bowel movements, including blood or pus.8,10 CD commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.6 The cause of UC or CD is not fully understood; however, recent research suggests hereditary, genetics, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to UC or CD.8,11,12

About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations.13,14 The SC formulation is currently approved in Europe, Canada and Australia only. It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).15 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.16 The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.15 These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).15,17,18 By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.15

Vedolizumab is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-antagonist.13,14 Vedolizumab has been granted marketing authorization in over 70 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 510,000 patient years of exposure to date.19

Therapeutic Indications for vedolizumab

Ulcerative colitis
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.

 

Crohn’s disease
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.

Important Safety Information for vedolizumab

Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.

Special warnings and special precautions for use
Intravenous vedolizumab should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering intravenous vedolizumab. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.

Infusion-related reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions
In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.

Infections
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity. Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the α4β7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. No systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.

Malignancies
The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.

Prior and concurrent use of biological products
No vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.

Vaccinations
Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.

Adverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in extremities, pyrexia, fatigue, injection site reactions and anaphylaxis.

Injection Site Reactions (subcutaneous vedolizumab)
No clinically relevant differences in the overall safety profile and adverse events were observed in patients who received subcutaneous vedolizumab compared to the safety profile observed in clinical studies with intravenous vedolizumab with the exception of injection site reactions (with subcutaneous administration only). Injection-site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, and none were reported as serious.

Please consult with your local regulatory agency for approved labeling in your country.

 Mirikizumab is a humanized IgG4 mAb that binds to the P19 subunit of interleukin 23 and being studied for the treatment of immune diseases, including psoriasis, UC, & CD","INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) announced today new efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 SERENITY study evaluating mirikizumab in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can cause systemic inflammation manifested as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, weight loss and lead to intestinal obstruction, fibrosis and other complications. SERENITY included a 12-week induction period and 40-week continued treatment period, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of multiple dosing regimens and two methods of administration through Week 52 as measured by endoscopic response, which reflects substantial reduction in inflammation of the lining of the bowel as seen during an endoscopy, and by Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) remission, two important treatment goals in Crohn’s disease. Detailed results from the trial are being presented virtually today in an abstract session at the United European Gastroenterology Week (UEG Week) 2020.

In the induction period, patients were randomized across four treatment arms to receive placebo or one of three doses of mirikizumab intravenously. At 12 weeks, patients who showed endoscopic improvement were randomized to continue mirikizumab treatment, administered either intravenously or subcutaneously. Patients who did not show endoscopic improvement or who had been randomized to the placebo arm in induction were assigned to receive mirikizumab treatment intravenously.

In the continued treatment period of the study, patients achieved key secondary outcomes at Week 52 including endoscopic response (defined as at least 50% reduction from baseline in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease [SES-CD]), PRO remission (defined as an average daily stool frequency of ≤2.5 and abdominal pain ≤1 and no worse than baseline) and endoscopic remission (defined as achieving an SES-CD score <4 for ileal-colonic disease or <2 for isolated ileal disease, and no subscore >1).

Endoscopic response: Nearly 60% of patients achieved endoscopic response (58.5% in the randomized IV dosing group and 58.7% in the SC group).
PRO remission: More than 45% of patients achieved PRO remission (46.3% in the IV group and 45.6% in the SC group).
“Crohn’s disease is a serious and difficult-to-treat condition, and there is a significant need for additional treatments. I am encouraged by the results of this study, which showed response in both symptom relief and endoscopic response and remission at 52 weeks of treatment with mirikizumab,” said Bruce E. Sands, MD, MS, Dr. Burrill B. Crohn Professor of Medicine, Chief of the Dr. Henry D. Janowitz Division of Gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

Among the subset of patients who achieved endoscopic response at Week 12, 69.6% and 66.7% in the IV (n=23) and SC (n=24) groups, respectively, also had endoscopic response at Week 52. Additionally, among those with endoscopic remission at Week 12, 50.0% and 64.3% in the IV (n=6) and SC (n=14) groups, respectively, also had endoscopic remission at Week 52.

“People who live with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease need additional treatment options and are looking for innovative therapies that can address their challenging and painful symptoms,” said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. “With these encouraging Phase 2 results, we look forwarding to continuing our clinical program for mirikizumab with the hope that we can provide help for those living with Crohn’s disease.”

One patient in each group among those who showed endoscopic improvement at Week 12 discontinued due to an adverse event (AE). Similar frequencies of treatment-emergent AEs and serious AEs were reported in IV and SC groups. The most common treatment-emergent AEs reported were nasopharyngitis (4.9% in IV group, 13% in SC group), headache (7.3% in IV group, 8.7% in SC group) and arthralgia (joint pain) (7.3% in IV group, 13% in SC group).

At UEG Week, Lilly also virtually presented additional results for mirikizumab from the Phase 2 Crohn’s disease study as well as data on bowel urgency and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).

About Mirikizumab
Mirikizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the P19 subunit of interleukin 23. Mirikizumab is being studied for the treatment of immune diseases, including psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.

About Crohn’s Disease
Crohn’s disease, which is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a chronic immune-mediated condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Crohn’s most commonly affects the end of the small bowel (the ileum) and the beginning of the colon, but it may affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus. IBD, which is inclusive of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, affects 10 million people worldwide.

About the Mirikizumab Phase 2 Trial in Crohn’s Disease
SERENITY, the Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, parallel-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of mirikizumab in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. At baseline, participants were randomized with a 2:1:1:2 allocation across four treatment arms (mirikizumab 200 mg, mirikizumab 600 mg, mirikizumab 1000 mg, and placebo). The primary endpoint was endoscopic response as determined by the proportion of participants achieving at least 50 percent reduction from baseline on the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES-CD) at Week 12. In May 2019, Lilly reported Phase 2 results showing more patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease receiving mirikizumab achieved clinical remission and response at 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile at 12 weeks was consistent with that of mirikizumab in studies of ulcerative colitis and with the class.

50236,Abbott's AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM Test Receives the US FDA's EUA for COVID-19,Abbott Receives FDA Emergency Use Authorization for its COVID-19 IgM Antibody Blood Test,"Abbott has received the US FDA’s EUA for AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM lab-based serology test for use on the ARCHITECT and Alinity platforms
 Till now, Abbott has received EUA for its seven tests, including molecular tests, a rapid antigen test and, an IgG Ab test for COVID-19
 The IgM test demonstrated 99.56% specificity and 95.00% sensitivity for patients tested 15 days after symptom onset. The test will give a more complete picture of where patients are in their recovery","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Oct. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the company’s AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM (Immunoglobulin M) lab-based serology test for use on the ARCHITECT® and Alinity™ platforms. IgM antibody testing can play an important role in understanding if someone has developed antibodies in response to the virus, indicating a recent or prior infection.

The new IgM antibody test is Abbott’s latest test to support in the fight against COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, Abbott has received emergency use authorization for seven tests, including molecular tests, a rapid antigen test and an IgG antibody test.

“Abbott has developed tests to detect the virus at each stage of infection so doctors and their patients are equipped with knowledge of how they are responding to the virus and progressing through recovery,” said Robert B. Ford, president and chief executive officer, Abbott. “Antibody tests will continue to play an important role to better understand the virus, the prevalence of COVID-19 in an area and where a patient may be in their recovery.”

Understanding a person’s immune response with antibody tests

While molecular tests detect whether someone has the virus, antibody tests determine if someone had a previous infection by detecting antibodies, such as IgM and IgG.

Abbott first developed an IgG blood test, which often is the antibody that is longer-lasting in the body after infection. This test has been widely adopted and continues to play a key role in understanding if someone has recovered from the virus, as well as contact tracing and epidemiological studies.1

The IgM antibody, in comparison, is most useful for determining a recent infection as these antibodies become undetectable weeks to months following infection.2 Having this more complete picture of where a patient is in their recovery can help healthcare providers determine if treatment, isolation or follow-up visits are needed.

Similar to Abbott’s IgG blood test, the IgM test has demonstrated high reliability in both Abbott’s research and external virology laboratory studies. Abbott’s data demonstrated 99.56% specificity and 95.00% sensitivity for patients tested 15 days after symptom onset.

The IgM test is now available on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity platforms.

— Filgotinib 200mg Achieved Endoscopic, Histologic and Six-Month Corticosteroid-Free Remission at Week 58 with a Consistent Safety Profile —

— Study Enrolled Biologic-Naïve and Biologic-Experienced Patients, a High Proportion of Whom Were Highly Refractory —

Foster City, Calif., & Mechelen, Belgium, October 12, 2020, 15.15 CET – Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Galapagos NV (Euronext & Nasdaq: GLPG) today presented late-breaking data demonstrating sustained efficacy and safety with filgotinib, an investigational, oral, once-daily, JAK1 preferential inhibitor, for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). The data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b/3 SELECTION trial showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg, versus placebo, achieved clinical remission at Week 10 and maintained remission through Week 58. In addition, significantly more patients achieved six-month corticosteroid-free remission. The full results were presented today at the 2020 United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW) Virtual Meeting (Abstracts #LB19 and #LB20).

UC is a longer-term condition characterized by inflammation of the mucosal lining of the colon and rectum. An increasingly prevalent disease, UC has a significant impact on the quality of life of more than 2 million people around the world. Despite current treatments, many patients experience fecal urgency, incontinence, recurring bloody diarrhea, and the need to empty their bowels frequently, often accompanied by abdominal pain, poor sleep and fatigue.

“There remains a tremendous need for treatments that can achieve meaningful and sustained clinical outcomes in ulcerative colitis,” said Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet, MD, PhD, Gastroenterology Department at Lorraine University in France, and presenting investigator of the SELECTION maintenance study. “These study results showed that filgotinib reduced bleeding and stool frequency while also achieving remission across a range of measures, including endoscopy and histology, in an oral formulation.”

The SELECTION study included biologic-naïve patients, for whom prior conventional therapy had failed, as well as biologic-experienced patients, a high proportion of whom had been non-responders to at least two different lines of prior biologics. In total, 43 percent of patients in the biologic-experienced cohort had failed treatment with both a TNF inhibitor and vedolizumab. The study allowed the enrollment of patients who were taking steroids, and/or immunomodulators, including methotrexate, mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine, as they would in real-world clinical practice.

Efficacy Data of Filgotinib in Induction and Maintenance
Overall, 1,348 biologic-naïve or biologic-experienced adult patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized and treated in the SELECTION study. Among biologic-naïve patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg, a significantly higher proportion of patients achieved clinical remission at Week 10 compared with placebo (26.1% vs. 15.3%, p=0.0157). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of biologic-naïve patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg versus placebo achieved Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) remission (24.5% vs. 12.4%, p=0.0053), endoscopic remission (12.2% vs. 3.6%, p=0.0047) and histologic remission (35.1% vs. 16.1%, p<0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of biologic-experienced patients treated with filgotinib 200mg achieved clinical remission at Week 10 compared with placebo (11.5% vs. 4.2%, p=0.0103).

Patients treated with filgotinib who achieved clinical response or remission at Week 10 were re-randomized to their induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58 (Maintenance Trial, n=558). At Week 58, 37.2 percent of patients receiving filgotinib 200 mg achieved clinical remission, compared with 11.2 percent of patients treated with placebo (p˂0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of those treated with filgotinib 200 mg versus placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (18.1% vs. 5.1%, p=0.0024), MCS remission (34.7% vs. 9.2%, p<0.0001), endoscopic remission (15.6% vs. 6.1%, p=0.0157) and histologic remission (38.2% vs. 13.3%, p<0.0001). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg achieved six-month corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 58 compared with placebo (27.2% vs. 6.4%, p=0.0055).

Safety Outcomes with Filgotinib in Ulcerative Colitis
Overall, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were similar in the filgotinib and placebo groups in both the induction and maintenance periods of the study. Serious infections, herpes zoster, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and gastrointestinal perforation were infrequent and comparable across treatment groups. The most common adverse events of interest in the induction trials were serious infections (1.1% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.6% filgotinib 200 mg, 1.1% placebo), herpes zoster (0.2% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.6% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo), opportunistic infections (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.2% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo) and pulmonary embolism (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.2% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo). In the maintenance trial, the most common adverse events of interest were serious infections (1.7% filgotinib 100 mg, 1.0% filgotinib 200 mg, 1.1% placebo), herpes zoster (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.5% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo) and venous thrombosis (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.0% filgotinib 200 mg, 2.2% placebo). Two deaths were observed in the filgotinib 200 mg treatment group in the maintenance trial; both adverse events leading to deaths were considered by the study investigators to be unrelated to study drug.

“Ulcerative colitis is a complex and unpredictable condition that can impact people in the prime of their lives. Despite treatment, people with UC can experience symptoms that have a significant impact on their quality of life,” said Mark Genovese, MD, Senior Vice President, Inflammation, Gilead Sciences. “We are pleased to share these data on the use of filgotinib in UC as we work to identify new treatment options to address unmet needs across a range of inflammatory diseases.”

“The SELECTION study assessed the efficacy and safety of filgotinib in some of the most difficult-to-treat patients with ulcerative colitis, including a high proportion of patients who were refractory to biologic treatment and in need of new treatment options,” said Dr. Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer, Galapagos. “The efficacy and safety data seen with filgotinib in this patient population add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the potential this once-daily treatment may offer patients living with this debilitating condition.”

About the SELECTION Phase 2b/3 Trial
The SELECTION Phase 2b/3 trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the JAK1 preferential inhibitor, filgotinib in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. The SELECTION trial comprises two induction trials and a maintenance trial. The Induction Study A enrolled biologic-naïve patients, and the Induction Study B enrolled biologic-experienced patients.

Across both induction studies, patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized to receive filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg or placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. Moderately to severely active UC was defined as a centrally read endoscopy score ≥ 2, a rectal bleeding score ≥ 1, a stool frequency score ≥ 1 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of ≥ 2 based on the MCS. Patients with clinical remission or response at Week 10 of induction were subsequently re-randomized to the induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58.

The primary objectives of SELECTION were to evaluate the efficacy of filgotinib compared with placebo in establishing clinical remission as determined by the Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and ≥ 1-point decrease in stool frequency from baseline to achieve a subscore of 0 or 1 at Week 10 in the induction studies and Week 58 in the maintenance study. Eligible patients who were enrolled in the SELECTION trial were enrolled in the ongoing SELECTION long-term extension trial to evaluate the long-term safety of filgotinib in patients with moderately to severely active UC.

— Filgotinib 200mg Achieved Endoscopic, Histologic and Six-Month Corticosteroid-Free Remission at Week 58 with a Consistent Safety Profile —

— Study Enrolled Biologic-Naïve and Biologic-Experienced Patients, a High Proportion of Whom Were Highly Refractory —

Foster City, Calif., & Mechelen, Belgium, October 12, 2020, 15.15 CET – Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Galapagos NV (Euronext & Nasdaq: GLPG) today presented late-breaking data demonstrating sustained efficacy and safety with filgotinib, an investigational, oral, once-daily, JAK1 preferential inhibitor, for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). The data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b/3 SELECTION trial showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg, versus placebo, achieved clinical remission at Week 10 and maintained remission through Week 58. In addition, significantly more patients achieved six-month corticosteroid-free remission. The full results were presented today at the 2020 United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW) Virtual Meeting (Abstracts #LB19 and #LB20).

UC is a longer-term condition characterized by inflammation of the mucosal lining of the colon and rectum. An increasingly prevalent disease, UC has a significant impact on the quality of life of more than 2 million people around the world. Despite current treatments, many patients experience fecal urgency, incontinence, recurring bloody diarrhea, and the need to empty their bowels frequently, often accompanied by abdominal pain, poor sleep and fatigue.

“There remains a tremendous need for treatments that can achieve meaningful and sustained clinical outcomes in ulcerative colitis,” said Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet, MD, PhD, Gastroenterology Department at Lorraine University in France, and presenting investigator of the SELECTION maintenance study. “These study results showed that filgotinib reduced bleeding and stool frequency while also achieving remission across a range of measures, including endoscopy and histology, in an oral formulation.”

The SELECTION study included biologic-naïve patients, for whom prior conventional therapy had failed, as well as biologic-experienced patients, a high proportion of whom had been non-responders to at least two different lines of prior biologics. In total, 43 percent of patients in the biologic-experienced cohort had failed treatment with both a TNF inhibitor and vedolizumab. The study allowed the enrollment of patients who were taking steroids, and/or immunomodulators, including methotrexate, mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine, as they would in real-world clinical practice.

Efficacy Data of Filgotinib in Induction and Maintenance
Overall, 1,348 biologic-naïve or biologic-experienced adult patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized and treated in the SELECTION study. Among biologic-naïve patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg, a significantly higher proportion of patients achieved clinical remission at Week 10 compared with placebo (26.1% vs. 15.3%, p=0.0157). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of biologic-naïve patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg versus placebo achieved Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) remission (24.5% vs. 12.4%, p=0.0053), endoscopic remission (12.2% vs. 3.6%, p=0.0047) and histologic remission (35.1% vs. 16.1%, p<0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of biologic-experienced patients treated with filgotinib 200mg achieved clinical remission at Week 10 compared with placebo (11.5% vs. 4.2%, p=0.0103).

Patients treated with filgotinib who achieved clinical response or remission at Week 10 were re-randomized to their induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58 (Maintenance Trial, n=558). At Week 58, 37.2 percent of patients receiving filgotinib 200 mg achieved clinical remission, compared with 11.2 percent of patients treated with placebo (p˂0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of those treated with filgotinib 200 mg versus placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (18.1% vs. 5.1%, p=0.0024), MCS remission (34.7% vs. 9.2%, p<0.0001), endoscopic remission (15.6% vs. 6.1%, p=0.0157) and histologic remission (38.2% vs. 13.3%, p<0.0001). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg achieved six-month corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 58 compared with placebo (27.2% vs. 6.4%, p=0.0055).

Safety Outcomes with Filgotinib in Ulcerative Colitis
Overall, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were similar in the filgotinib and placebo groups in both the induction and maintenance periods of the study. Serious infections, herpes zoster, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and gastrointestinal perforation were infrequent and comparable across treatment groups. The most common adverse events of interest in the induction trials were serious infections (1.1% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.6% filgotinib 200 mg, 1.1% placebo), herpes zoster (0.2% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.6% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo), opportunistic infections (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.2% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo) and pulmonary embolism (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.2% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo). In the maintenance trial, the most common adverse events of interest were serious infections (1.7% filgotinib 100 mg, 1.0% filgotinib 200 mg, 1.1% placebo), herpes zoster (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.5% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo) and venous thrombosis (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.0% filgotinib 200 mg, 2.2% placebo). Two deaths were observed in the filgotinib 200 mg treatment group in the maintenance trial; both adverse events leading to deaths were considered by the study investigators to be unrelated to study drug.

“Ulcerative colitis is a complex and unpredictable condition that can impact people in the prime of their lives. Despite treatment, people with UC can experience symptoms that have a significant impact on their quality of life,” said Mark Genovese, MD, Senior Vice President, Inflammation, Gilead Sciences. “We are pleased to share these data on the use of filgotinib in UC as we work to identify new treatment options to address unmet needs across a range of inflammatory diseases.”

“The SELECTION study assessed the efficacy and safety of filgotinib in some of the most difficult-to-treat patients with ulcerative colitis, including a high proportion of patients who were refractory to biologic treatment and in need of new treatment options,” said Dr. Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer, Galapagos. “The efficacy and safety data seen with filgotinib in this patient population add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the potential this once-daily treatment may offer patients living with this debilitating condition.”

About the SELECTION Phase 2b/3 Trial
The SELECTION Phase 2b/3 trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the JAK1 preferential inhibitor, filgotinib in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. The SELECTION trial comprises two induction trials and a maintenance trial. The Induction Study A enrolled biologic-naïve patients, and the Induction Study B enrolled biologic-experienced patients.

Across both induction studies, patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized to receive filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg or placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. Moderately to severely active UC was defined as a centrally read endoscopy score ≥ 2, a rectal bleeding score ≥ 1, a stool frequency score ≥ 1 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of ≥ 2 based on the MCS. Patients with clinical remission or response at Week 10 of induction were subsequently re-randomized to the induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58.

The primary objectives of SELECTION were to evaluate the efficacy of filgotinib compared with placebo in establishing clinical remission as determined by the Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and ≥ 1-point decrease in stool frequency from baseline to achieve a subscore of 0 or 1 at Week 10 in the induction studies and Week 58 in the maintenance study. Eligible patients who were enrolled in the SELECTION trial were enrolled in the ongoing SELECTION long-term extension trial to evaluate the long-term safety of filgotinib in patients with moderately to severely active UC.

In combination with other COVID-19 diagnostic tests, the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test can help in the management of patients for optimal care delivery
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that it intends to launch a high-volume SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test as an aid in the diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The test is planned to be made available at the end of 2020 for markets accepting the CE Mark. Roche also intends to file for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The Elecsys® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is a highly accurate laboratory immunoassay for the in vitro qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid antigen of SARS-CoV-2. The test is performed by healthcare professionals and uses nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples from patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, or people with either known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen immunoassay runs on all cobas e immunochemistry analysers which are widely available around the world. These fully automated systems can provide test results in 18 minutes for a single test (excluding time for sample collection, transport, and preparation), with a throughput of up to 300 tests per hour from a single analyser, depending on the analyser.1 A laboratory based automated antigen assay allows for cost and error reduction due to removal of manual handling as well as fast turn-around times and high test throughput.

Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics, stated, “We are aware that governments and healthcare systems are under intense pressure to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity to effectively manage the spread of the virus. A high-volume antigen test is a valuable addition to the testing portfolio for helping diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. Being able to quickly and correctly identify if someone has a SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to informing patient management decisions and containing the spread of COVID-19. Roche remains committed to supporting governments, healthcare professionals and patients to fight this pandemic with the help of our diagnostics solutions.”

The test will be another addition to the comprehensive Roche diagnostic portfolio of solutions to help healthcare systems combat COVID-19 through testing in the laboratory and at the point of care. These solutions include both tests to detect an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and tests measuring the body’s immune response upon infection or vaccination. The following table provides an overview of Roche’s current COVID-19 test portfolio for the detection of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or immune response:

For more information, please also refer to the following infographic: 3 Factors that decide on the appropriate SARS-CoV-2 Test.

About the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test
Roche’s Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is an immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of a specific antigen of SARS-CoV-2 present in the respiratory tract including nasopharynx and oropharynx. The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is performed by healthcare professionals and could be used as an alternative or in conjunction with PCR testing. This is highly beneficial where reliable laboratory PCR testing is not available or where there are challenges in testing capacity. A positive result with the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test most likely indicates an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. A negative result may require to be confirmed with a PCR test or repeated (antigen test) after one to two days, if other clinical indications point to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Performance evaluations around sensitivity and specificity of the test are ongoing and will be shared at the time of launch.

About antigen testing
An antigen test detects proteins which are structural or functional components of a pathogen and are thus very specific to that pathogen.2 In this case, the test would provide a qualitative “yes/no” answer on the presence of the pathogen in the patient sample. If the target antigen is present in sufficient concentrations in the sample, it will bind to specific antibodies and generate a positive result.3

In general, antigen tests have a high specificity, though are not as sensitive as PCR tests that amplify the target viral DNA or RNA sequence in order to generate a quantifiable signal to indicate the presence of the virus in a sample. Therefore, to make up for the potential decrease in sensitivity of an antigen test, negative results should be analysed together with additional patient factors, such as COVID-19 exposure history, clinical symptoms, additional test results to help guide the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of the patient.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
As a leading healthcare company we are doing all we can to support countries in minimising the impact of COVID-19. We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help to manage, detect and diagnose current and/or previous infection in patients, as well as providing digital support to healthcare systems. We continue to identify, develop and support potential therapies which can play a role in treating the disease.

We understand the impact of COVID-19 goes beyond those who contract it, which is why we are working with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need during these challenging times. As we learn from the pandemic, we are partnering with governments and others to make healthcare stronger and more sustainable in the future.

Our diagnostics solutions:

Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. Our portfolio includes:

a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, (FDA Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) and available in countries accepting the CE Mark)
a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-based qualitative antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood targeting the nucleocapsid protein (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
an IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19 (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic
a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test to help determine at the point of care whether a person has been exposed to the virus (CE Mark)
a rapid antigen test to support in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care within 15 minutes (CE Mark)
a high-volume molecular test to simultaneously detect and differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B, as the symptoms are similar for both (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
a second SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, aimed at measuring the spike protein to support vaccination development and complement our existing portfolio (CE Mark)
Our research into therapies:

Roche is committed to improving the treatment of COVID-19. We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are exploring the potential of our investigational molecules.

Specifically, on 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA – a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. On 29 July we announced that COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia or the key secondary endpoint of reduced mortality.

Separately, we have studied Actemra©/RoActemra© in the EMPACTA study in COVID-19 associated hospitalised pneumonia in patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials. On 18 September we announced that the phase III EMPACTA study showed Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care reduced the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. However, there was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra/RoActemra or placebo.

Actemra©/RoActemra© is also being studied in combination with the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the REMDACTA trial in partnership with Gilead, announced 28 May. Actemra©/RoActemra© is not approved by any health authority for use in COVID-19 pneumonia. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.

In August we signed a collaboration agreement with Regeneron on developing and manufacturing and significantly increasing global supply of an investigational antibody combination for COVID-19 if it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

50298,J&amp;J Pauses Dosing in COVID-19 Vaccine Studies Due to Unexplained Illness,Johnson & Johnson Temporarily Pauses All Dosing in Our Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Clinical Trials,"J&J temporarily pauses the further dosing in all clinical studies of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate JNJ-78436735, including the P-III ENSEMBLE trial, due to an “unexplained illness” in one participant
 Following the guidelines, the subject’s illness is being reviewed and evaluated by the ENSEMBLE independent DSMB, as well as its own internal clinical and safety physicians. J&J reported that all clinical studies it conducts have prespecified guidelines allowing them to pause if an unexpected SAEs occurred
 The pause of the ENSEMBLE study comes just over a month after AstraZeneca confirmed that its P-III study was put on hold due to a possible safety issue. J&J had started the ENSEMBLE study last month to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single vaccine dose in preventing COVID-19","At Johnson & Johnson, there is no greater priority than the safety and well being of the people we serve every day around the world. We are committed to providing transparent updates throughout the clinical development process of our vaccine candidate, in compliance with regulatory standards and our own high ethical and scientific principles.

We have temporarily paused further dosing in all our COVID-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials, including the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial, due to an unexplained illness in a study participant. Following our guidelines, the participant’s illness is being reviewed and evaluated by the ENSEMBLE independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as well as our internal clinical and safety physicians.

Adverse events – illnesses, accidents, etc. – even those that are serious, are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies. Based on our strong commitment to safety, all clinical studies conducted by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson have prespecified guidelines. These ensure our studies may be paused if an unexpected serious adverse event (SAE) that might be related to a vaccine or study drug is reported, so there can be a careful review of all of the medical information before deciding whether to restart the study.

We must respect this participant’s privacy. We’re also learning more about this participant’s illness, and it’s important to have all the facts before we share additional information.

SAEs are not uncommon in clinical trials, and the number of SAEs can reasonably be expected to increase in trials involving large numbers of participants. Further, as many trials are placebo-controlled, it is not always immediately apparent whether a participant received a study treatment or a placebo.

“Study Pause” vs. “Regulatory Hold:” What’s the Difference?

While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there is a significant distinction between a study pause and a regulatory hold of a clinical trial.

A study pause, in which recruitment or dosing is paused by the study sponsor, is a standard component of a clinical trial protocol. As noted in the ENSEMBLE study protocol, Johnson & Johnson has robust mechanisms in place to protect the safety of participants in its clinical trials. While the Company informs all study investigators, we typically do not communicate study pauses publicly.
A regulatory hold of a clinical trial is a requirement by a regulatory health authority, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As outlined in our transparency commitments, we proactively disclose any regulatory hold of a pivotal clinical trial.

 LNS8801 (PO) is a bioavailable small molecule that is a highly specific and potent agonist of the GPER and has demonstrated target engagement and clinical benefit in advanced cancer patients. P-l/ll study’s results are anticipated to be presented in a peer-reviewed setting in 2021","HADDONFIELD, N.J., Oct. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Linnaeus Therapeutics, Inc. (Linnaeus), a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel small molecule oncology therapeutics, today announced that it has dosed the first patient in its phase 1/2 adaptive-design clinical trial of its lead-product-candidate, LNS8801, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients who had previous clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and then subsequently progressed. This marks the first time any company has dosed a patient in a clinical trial specifically targeting the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in combination with pembrolizumab. The initiation of the study follows the successful identification of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in the Company’s ongoing study of LNS8801.

LNS8801 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that is a highly specific and potent agonist of the GPER. LNS8801 is currently finishing the dose escalation portion of its phase 1/2 study assessing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced cancer.

“We are extremely pleased to begin testing LNS8801 in combination with pembrolizumab in this patient population. In our phase 1 trial of LNS8801 we have seen biological and clinical signals that suggest LNS8801 in combination with pembrolizumab may have activity based on the preclinical rationale and reverse resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We currently have six outstanding academic comprehensive cancer centers all enthusiastically recruiting patients for this promising study,” commented Patrick Mooney, MD, chief executive officer of Linnaeus. “We believe that LNS8801 with pembrolizumab has potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit for patients with cancer, and we look forward to providing updates over the course of the study.”

The study entitled, “A Multicenter Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Antitumor Activity of LNS8801 in Patients with Advanced Cancer Including Immunotherapy Refractory Expansion Cohorts with and without Pembrolizumab,” was designed in two parts. The phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of LNS8801. Data from the study has allowed Linnaeus to determine the RP2D and safely open the phase 2 dose-expansion cohorts. Linnaeus anticipates opening several more phase 2 dose-expansion cohorts exploring LNS8801 activity as a monotherapy and in combination with other compounds in defined patient populations in the coming year.

KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.

About LNS8801
LNS8801 is an orally bioavailable and highly specific agonist of GPER whose activity is dependent on the expression of GPER. GPER activation suppresses well-known tumor-associated genes, such as c-Myc and PD-L1. In preclinical cancer models, LNS8801 displays potent antitumor activities across a wide range of tumor types, rapidly shrinking tumors and inducing immune memory.

In the ongoing phase 1/2 study in humans, LNS8801 monotherapy has been safe and well-tolerated. Additionally, LNS8801 has demonstrated target engagement and clinical benefit in advanced cancer patients. Data from the phase 1/2 study is anticipated to be presented in a peer-reviewed setting in 2021.

50325,Moderna Initiates Rolling Submission to Health Canada for mRNA-1273 Against COVID-19,Moderna Announces Initiation of Rolling Submission to Health Canada for mRNA Vaccine Against COVID-19 (mRNA-1273),"The initiation of a rolling submission follows positive results from a preclinical viral challenge study of mRNA-1273 and the +ve interim analysis of the P-l study of mRNA-1273 in healthy adults (aged 18-55 yrs.) and older adults (aged 56-70 and 71+), published in the NEJM
 Moderna has become the third maker that initiates the rolling submission to Health Canada for speeding up the approval. Health Canada is already conducting real-time reviews of BioNTech & Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine candidates along with AstraZeneca’s candidate
 The rolling reviews speed up the process of approving a vaccine, allowing researchers to submit findings in real-time, without having to wait for studies to conclude","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Oct. 13, 2020– Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced the initiation of a rolling submission to Health Canada for mRNA-1273, the Company’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19. This initiation follows positive results from a preclinical viral challenge study of mRNA-1273 and the positive interim analysis of the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 in healthy adults (ages 18-55 years) and older adults (ages 56-70 and 71+) published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The rolling submission has been accepted under the Canadian Minister of Health’s Interim Order, which permits companies to submit safety and efficacy data and information as they become available. This rolling review process allows Health Canada to begin its assessment using the information submitted by the applicant and accept new evidence as it becomes available until the application is deemed complete. This process can reduce time to authorization for these important new drugs while maintaining appropriate standards of safety, efficacy, and quality. Health Canada will not make a decision to authorize any vaccine being considered under rolling review until it has received all necessary evidence to support its safety and efficacy. Following the authorization of any vaccine submission, Health Canada will publish the evidence used in making its decision for transparency.

On September 22, the Canadian Government increased its confirmed order commitment to 20 million doses of mRNA-1273. Moderna remains on track to be able to deliver up to 56 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to help protect Canadians beginning in 2021. The Canadian vaccine supply will be sourced from Moderna’s European production capacity with its strategic manufacturing partner Lonza of Switzerland, and ROVI of Spain for fill-finish services.

“We are pleased with the interactions with the Canadian regulatory authorities and we appreciate their guidance and confidence in Moderna to pursue a rolling submission in Canada for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273,” said Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are committed to developing a safe and effective vaccine following the guidance of regulatory agencies around the world and we will continue working closely with Health Canada.”

The Phase 1 interim analysis showed that mRNA-1273 was generally well-tolerated across all age groups and induced rapid and strong immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. In the 18-55 age group, neutralizing antibody titers were observed in 100% of evaluated participants and at the 100 µg dose level selected for Phase 3, the geometric mean titers were above those seen in convalescent sera. Similarly, mRNA-1273 induced consistently high levels of pseudovirus neutralization antibody titers in all participants in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups. In addition, vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicited Th1-biased CD4 T cell responses in all age groups.

mRNA-1273 is currently being studied in a Phase 3 randomized, 1:1 placebo-controlled trial of 30,000 participants at the 100 µg dose level in the U.S. As of Friday, October 9, the Phase 3 COVE study has enrolled approximately 28,618 participants with 22,194 having received their second vaccination. The clinicaltrials.gov identifier is NCT04470427. For more information about the Phase 3 COVE study, click here.

About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality

Moderna scientists designed the company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. Across Moderna’s pipeline, more than 30,000 healthy volunteers and patients have been enrolled in Moderna’s clinical studies, including the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across Phase 1 studies, the company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has seven development candidates in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

Vaccines against respiratory infections

RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)
COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273)
Influenza H7N9 vaccine (mRNA-1851)
Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647)
Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA)
Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189)
To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for eight prophylactic vaccines (H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3, CMV, Zika and COVID-19). Moderna’s CMV vaccine is currently in a Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna’s investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.

 Results: Median overall TOT for patients who received 2L afatinib & CT (7.3mos. & 4.2mos.); the incidence of irAEs occurred in 6 patients while no reported irAES in the chemotherapy cohort.
 Separate data presented indicate Gilotrif activity in TKI-naïve patients with G719X/L861Q/S768I non-resistant EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Gilotrif is indicated for metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have non-resistant EGFR mutations and for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, progressed after treatment with platinum-based CT","RIDGEFIELD, Conn., Oct. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Boehringer Ingelheim today announced new data for Gilotrif® (afatinib) which further affirm its activity in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and, in a separate study, epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive (EGFR M+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The findings are being presented at the IASLC 2020 North America Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (NACLC 2020).

Analysis from a retrospective, real-world study of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC who progressed on first-line pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy provides effectiveness and safety data for afatinib following immunotherapy (IO) in this second-line setting. Median overall time on treatment (TOT) for patients who received second-line afatinib was 7.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]; 5.2-8.1). Incidence of severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occurred in six patients (pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis). This analysis also evaluated chemotherapy in this second-line setting, with median overall TOT of 4.2 months (95% CI; 3.9-4.9). There were no reported irAES in the chemotherapy cohort.

“Given relatively recent advances with immunotherapy, prospective trials have yet to investigate the use of afatinib following first-line immunotherapy and chemotherapy in metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer,” said Edward S. Kim, M.D., FACP, Levine Cancer Institute. “Findings from this study suggest that second-line afatinib is generally well-tolerated and effective in patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung when pembrolizumab is added to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.”

In a separate data set presented at the meeting, researchers assessed the use of afatinib in Asian and non-Asian patients with EGFRm+ NSCLC whose tumors have G719X/L861Q/S768I non-resistant mutations, pooled from randomized clinical trials and real-world studies. The analysis showed that afatinib is effective in these patients, and is unaffected by ethnicity (overall response rate: 66% Asian/59% non-Asian; median duration of response: 14.7 months/15.9 months; G719X: 62%/65%; L861Q: 60%/50%; S768I: 80%/25%).

Bjoern Rueter, M.D., Therapeutic Area Head Oncology, USA, at Boehringer Ingelheim, said, “These data sets further expand our understanding of afatinib’s therapeutic profile in metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer and among those with EGFR mutation-positive disease. As we continue to take cancer on at Boehringer Ingelheim, our ongoing research is aimed at supporting unmet treatment needs for the lung cancer and broader oncology community through leading science.”

Gilotrif is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have non-resistant EGFR mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test. Gilotrif is also approved for the treatment of patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung whose disease has progressed after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.

Data Presentations Featured at IASLC NACLC 2020:

Real-world Effectiveness and Safety of Afatinib Following Immunotherapy (IO) in the Treatment of Metastatic, Squamous Cell/Mixed Histology Carcinoma of the Lung: A Multi-site Retrospective Chart Review Trial in the US. Friday October 16, 17:00-18:00 CDT.

 Dyno will be responsible for the design of novel AAV capsids with improved functional properties for gene therapy while Roche and Spark will conduct preclinical, clinical, and commercialization activities for the products using the novel capsids
 The collaboration leverages Dyno’s CapsidMap platform for the development of next-generation AAV vectors for CNS diseases and liver-directed therapies for the portfolio of both Roche and Spark","Cambridge, MA – October 14, 2020 – Dyno Therapeutics, a biotech company applying artificial intelligence (AI) to gene therapy, today announced a collaboration and license agreement with Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) to apply Dyno’s CapsidMap™ platform for the development of next-generation adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for gene therapies for central nervous system (CNS) diseases and liver-directed therapies for the portfolio of both Roche and Spark Therapeutics, a member of the Roche Group.

Dyno’s proprietary CapsidMap™ platform represents a transformative approach to the identification of novel AAV capsids – the cell-targeting protein shell of viral vectors – optimizing tissue targeting and immune-evading properties, in addition to improving packaging capacity and manufacturability.

Under the terms of the agreement, Dyno will be responsible for the design of novel AAV capsids with improved functional properties for gene therapy, while Roche and Spark Therapeutics will be responsible for conducting preclinical, clinical and commercialization activities for gene therapy product candidates using the novel capsids. Dyno will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and if successful, is eligible to receive additional payments during the research phase of the collaboration as well as clinical and sales milestone payments and royalties for any resulting products. The aggregate potential value of future milestone payments to Dyno may exceed $1.8 billion.

“This new partnership represents Dyno’s largest collaboration to date, and we are excited to work with Roche and Spark Therapeutics to expand the frontier of gene therapies for the central nervous system and liver. The Dyno, Roche and Spark teams share a bold vision for gene therapy and believe that enhancing vectors that deliver these therapies is key to developing new treatments for patients in need,” stated Dyno’s CEO and co-founder Eric Kelsic, Ph.D. “Partnering is a fundamental element of Dyno’s business strategy, and the continuing interest by leading gene therapy developers is accelerating our growth plans and positive impact on patients.”

“We strongly believe in the potential of gene therapy and are excited to bring together experts from Roche, Spark and Dyno to develop next-generation gene therapies. Dyno’s innovative AI-powered approach to designing optimized AAV vectors will further complement and build on our progress in gene therapy. We look forward to leveraging Dyno’s technology to develop new, innovative treatments for patients across CNS and liver-directed therapies,” said James Sabry, Head of Roche Pharma Partnering.

About CapsidMap™ for Designing AAV Gene Therapies

By designing capsids that confer improved functional properties to Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vectors, Dyno’s proprietary CapsidMap™ platform overcomes the limitations of today’s gene therapies on the market and in development. Today’s treatments are primarily confined to a small number of naturally occurring AAV vectors that are limited by delivery, immunity, packaging size, and manufacturing challenges. CapsidMap uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology for the design of novel capsids, the cell-targeting protein shell of viral vectors. The CapsidMap platform applies leading-edge DNA library synthesis and next generation DNA sequencing to measure in vivo gene delivery properties in high throughput. At the core of CapsidMap are advanced search algorithms leveraging machine learning and Dyno’s massive quantities of experimental data, that together build a comprehensive map of sequence space and thereby accelerate the discovery and optimization of synthetic AAV capsids.

About Dyno Therapeutics

Dyno Therapeutics is a pioneer in applying artificial intelligence (AI) and quantitative high-throughput in vivo experiments to gene therapy. The company’s proprietary CapsidMap™ platform rapidly discovers and systematically optimizes Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) capsid vectors that significantly outperform current approaches for in vivo gene delivery, thereby expanding the range of diseases treatable with gene therapies. Dyno was founded in 2018 by experienced biotech entrepreneurs and leading scientists in the fields of gene therapy and machine learning. The company is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

50363,"Regeneron's Inmazeb (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab) Receives the US FDA's Approval as the First Treatment for Ebola",Regeneron’s Antibody Cocktail REGN-EB3 (Inmazeb®) is First FDA-Approved Treatment for Ebola (Zaire Ebolavirus),"The approval is based on the PALM trial assessing Inmazeb vs Zmapp and remdesivir in 681 adult and pediatric patients including newborns of mothers who have tested positive for the infection. The study demonstrated 1EPs of mortality @28days (33.5% vs 51.3%) and 2EPs of reduction in days until the virus was undetectable in the bloodstream
 As per the agreement signed in Jul’2020, Regeneron will deliver a number of Inmazeb treatment doses for 6yrs. to the BARDA.
 Inmazeb is a triple antibody cocktail consisting of 3 mAbs (atoltivimab, maftivimab & odesivimab, 50 mg each /kg) that bind to different, non-overlapping epitopes on Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein","In a large clinical trial, Inmazeb showed superiority compared to other investigational agents (ZMapp and remdesivir) with respect to mortality; treatment was most effective when given early in the course of disease1

Inmazeb (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) is a novel anti-viral antibody medicine developed using the same ‘rapid response’ technologies as Regeneron’s investigational COVID-19 antibody combination

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus in adult and pediatric patients, including newborns of mothers who have tested positive for the infection.

“We are incredibly proud that the FDA has approved Inmazeb, which is also known as REGN-EB3. This is the first time the FDA has approved a treatment specifically for Ebola, which has caused a number of deadly outbreaks,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “Decades of investment in our VelociSuite® rapid response technologies, the dedication of world-class scientists, and the courageous contributions of healthcare providers and patients, together with remarkable cooperation between leading international health organizations and governments, have led to this important moment. As we apply the same sophisticated technologies and manufacturing capabilities against COVID-19, we hope this will be one of many demonstrations of how the power of science can be successfully deployed against dangerous infectious diseases.”

As part of an agreement announced in July 2020, Regeneron will deliver an established number of Inmazeb treatment doses over the course of six years to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), as part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) goal of building national preparedness for public health emergencies.

In keeping with our mission and values, Regeneron is committed to making this important medicine available to the people who need it. In response to the 2018 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), we worked with the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. FDA and other global organizations to offer Inmazeb under a compassionate use protocol and include it in the four-arm PALM (PAmoja TuLinde Maisha) Trial. With BARDA support, we continue to provide Inmazeb for free in response to outbreaks in the DRC through the MEURI protocol for compassionate use. Regeneron is actively working with non-governmental organizations and public health agencies to ensure continued access to Inmazeb in low- and middle-income countries.

“Since 2015, BARDA has partnered with Regeneron to develop a life-saving treatment for Ebola Zaire. The Food and Drug Administration’s approval of Inmazeb shows the power of public private partnerships to bring forward these critical treatments and improve global public health,” said Gary Disbrow, the Acting Director of BARDA. “BARDA is continuing our collaboration with Regeneron on other life-threatening diseases such as MERS and COVID-19, and we look forward to continued success.”

The safety and efficacy of Inmazeb was established through the 681-patient PALM Trial, a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial initiated in 2018 in the DRC. The WHO, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in the DRC jointly sponsored and served as co-principal investigators of the trial. In 2019, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, the PALM Trial was stopped early following a pre-specified interim analysis that showed superiority of Inmazeb to ZMapp and remdesivir with respect to mortality. Adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of Inmazeb patients were chills, elevation in fever (pyrexia), rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), rapid breathing (tachypnea), vomiting, low blood pressure (hypotension), diarrhea and inadequate oxygen supply to the tissue (hypoxia); of these, only chills occurred more frequently with Inmazeb than ZMapp. The evaluation of AEs in Inmazeb patients may have been confounded by the signs and symptoms of the underlying Zaire ebolavirus infection.

About Inmazeb
Inmazeb, previously called REGN-EB3, was created using Regeneron’s VelocImmune® platform and associated VelociSuite® technologies. The treatment consists of three monoclonal antibodies of similar structure, atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab, that bind to different, non-overlapping epitopes on Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein. The three antibodies help neutralize the Ebola virus by blocking its ability to invade patients’ and/or enlisting other immune cells to target infected cells and remove them from the body.

Inmazeb is administered as a single, weight-based intravenous infusion (50 mg atoltivimab, 50 mg maftivimab and 50 mg odesivimab per kg). Inmazeb was developed in collaboration and with federal funds from BARDA, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the HHS under ongoing USG Contract Nos. HHSO100201700016C and HHSO100201500013C.

INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

INDICATION
INMAZEB is indicated for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates born to a mother who is RT-PCR positive for Zaire ebolavirus infection.

Limitations of Use: The efficacy of INMAZEB has not been established for other species of the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera. Zaire ebolavirus can change over time, and factors such as emergence of resistance, or changes in viral virulence could diminish the clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Consider available information on drug susceptibility patterns for circulating Zaire ebolavirus strains when deciding to use INMAZEB.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Infusion-Associated Events: Hypersensitivity reactions including infusion-associated events have been reported during and post-infusion with INMAZEB. These may include acute, life-threatening reactions during and after the infusion. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms including, but not limited to, hypotension, chills and elevation of fever, during and following INMAZEB infusion. In the case of severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, discontinue the administration of INMAZEB immediately and administer appropriate emergency care.

Infusion could not be completed in 1% of subjects who received INMAZEB due to infusion-associated adverse events. The rate of infusion of INMAZEB may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops any signs of infusion-associated events or other adverse events.

ADVERSE REACTIONS:

The most common adverse events reported in at least 10% of subjects who received INMAZEB were pyrexia (or elevation in fever), chills, tachycardia, tachypnea, vomiting, hypotension, diarrhea and hypoxia. The evaluation of adverse events in subjects who received INMAZEB may have been confounded by the signs and symptoms of the underlying Zaire ebolavirus infection.
Selected grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities for INMAZEB included high sodium (≥ 154 mmol/L), low sodium (<125 mmol/L), high potassium (≥ 6.5 mmol/L), low potassium (< 2.5 mmol/L), creatinine ((mg/dL) ≥ 1.8 x ULN), high alanine aminotransferase ((U/L) ≥ 5 x ULN) and high aspartate aminotransferase ((U/L) ≥ 5 x ULN).
DRUG INTERACTIONS: INMAZEB may reduce the efficacy of live vaccine therefore, avoid the concurrent administration of a live vaccine during treatment with INMAZEB. The interval between live vaccination following initiation of INMAZEB therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines.

50375,Takeda Collaborates with Accenture and AWS to Transform into a Cloud-Based Company,Takeda Accelerates Digital Transformation with Accenture and AWS,"Takeda has entered into a five-year agreement with Accenture and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support the company in moving 80% of its applications to the cloud and modernizing its research tools
 The transition of Takeda’s applications to the cloud will enable the company to remove non-differentiating technology and create a scalable architecture. The collaboration will leverage cloud and data-driven insights to accelerate drug development, increase operational agility, reduce technology costs, and develop the workforce of the future
 Additionally, the collaboration with Accenture and AWS has already helped the Takeda to use the cloud in launching a clinical trial acceleration and secure data-sharing platform for the COVID R&D Alliance in <5days. The COVID R&D Alliance is a consortium comprising 20 companies, including Takeda, Amgen, and AbbVie to study and identify the potential of COVID-19 therapies","Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE: 4502/NYSE: TAK) (“Takeda”), Accenture (NYSE: ACN) and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) have entered into a five-year strategic agreement to accelerate Takeda’s digital transformation.

Not only will patients benefit from Takeda’s ability to respond with greater speed, agility, and insights across the value chain, but customers, employees, and partners will also benefit. This long-term collaboration will fuel Takeda’s cloud-driven business transformation by modernizing platforms, accelerating data services, establishing an internal engine for innovation, and equipping Takeda’s employees with new skills and ways of working.

“By combining the power of three organizations, Takeda is making a bold move to be at the intersection of human health, technology and business growth,” said Christophe Weber, Takeda president and chief executive officer. “My vision is that, in less than ten years, every Takeda employee will be empowered by an artificial intelligence assistant to help make better decisions, enabling us to deliver transformative therapies and better experiences to patients, physicians and payers faster than previously possible. Together, Accenture and AWS will propel Takeda further than we could alone to make this vision a reality.”

Taking a cloud-first technology approach will create a more scalable, reliable and secure architecture and eliminate unnecessary integration activities. By moving 80% of applications to the cloud, Takeda will remove non-differentiating technology, reduce its internal data center footprint, and decrease capital expenditures.

“By leveraging the most comprehensive set of cloud services in the industry, innovators like Takeda can cut costs, time to insight and discovery, and improve patient experiences,” said Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of AWS. “The breadth and depth of AWS services enable Takeda to quickly and efficiently discover, develop, and manufacture therapeutics securely and compliantly. We’re excited to continue our work with Takeda as they innovate to deliver accessible and promising new therapies to save lives.”

Accelerating the delivery of data services and capabilities will help Takeda increase connectivity and collaboration with the life sciences ecosystem and external partners. For example, the collaboration has already helped Takeda harness the cloud to launch, in less than five days, a secure data sharing and clinical trial acceleration platform for the COVID R&D Alliance.

Safety observed in the trial was generally consistent with previously published data on the individual components of the combination and no new safety signals were identified
October 14, 2020 02:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time
WHIPPANY, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bayer announced today that the Phase III study CHRONOS-3 evaluating Aliqopa™ (copanlisib) in combination with rituximab in indolent Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (iNHL) patients (n=458) who have relapsed after one or more prior lines of rituximab-containing therapy has met its primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival (PFS). The study predominantly included patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma, as well as patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia. In 2017, based on the Phase II CHRONOS-1 study, Aliqopa was approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed FL who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate (ORR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

CHRONOS-3 is a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the objective to evaluate whether Aliqopa in combination with rituximab is superior to placebo plus rituximab in extending PFS in patients with relapsed iNHL following at least one prior rituximab product. The safety observed in the trial was generally consistent with previously published data on the individual components of the combination and no new safety signals were identified.

“Indolent forms of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma are a heterogenous group of malignancies characterized by a chronic pattern of remissions and recurrences. For iNHL patients with disease progression who are in need of treatment, there are few approved treatment options,” said Dr. Scott Z. Fields, Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology Development at Bayer. “The positive results from CHRONOS-3 demonstrate the potential clinical benefit of copanlisib in combination with rituximab, to address the unmet medical need in these patients.”

Results from CHRONOS-3 will be presented at a scientific congress. Bayer plans to discuss the data from CHRONOS-3 with health authorities worldwide.

Aliqopa is an intravenous phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor with predominant activity against alpha and delta isoforms the PI3K-alpha and PI3K-delta isoforms expressed in malignant B cells.i Aliqopa is approved in the U.S. under the accelerated approval pathway for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed FL who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on an ORR of 59% (n=61) 95% CI: 49, 68, including 14% (15/104) of complete responses (CRs) from the open-label, single-arm multicenter, Phase II clinical trial (CHRONOS-1), in a total of 142 subjects, which included 104 subjects with follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had relapsed disease following at least two prior treatments. In the updated two-year follow-up analysis, Aliqopa ORR was 59% (n=61) 95% CI: 49, 68, including 20% CR (n=21).ii Tumor response was assessed according to the International Working Group response criteria for malignant lymphoma. Efficacy based on ORR was assessed by an Independent Review Committee. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

About CHRONOS-3

CHRONOS-3 is a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Aliqopa in combination with rituximab versus placebo in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent NHL who have received at least one or more lines of prior rituximab-containing treatment. Histological subtypes included in the trial were follicular lymphoma (FL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Patients must have relapsed after the last rituximab- containing therapy and either had a treatment-free interval of ≥ 12 months after completion of the last rituximab-containing treatment, or are unwilling to receive chemotherapy or for whom chemotherapy is contraindicated on reason of age, comorbidities, and/or residual toxicity (NCT02367040). The study enrolled 458 participants.

About Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) comprises a highly heterogeneous group of chronic diseases with poor prognosis. NHL is the most common hematologic malignancy and the tenth most common cancer worldwide, with nearly 510,000 new cases diagnosed in 2018. It accounts for nearly 249,000 deaths worldwide in 2018.

Indolent NHL consists of multiple subtypes, including follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM). While the disease is typically slowly growing, it can become more aggressive over time. Despite treatment advances, there remains a need for improved treatment options for the relapsed or refractory stage of the disease. After response to initial therapy, response rates and duration of response decline with subsequent lines of therapy, underscoring the need for patients whose disease has already progressed.

About Aliqopa™ (copanlisib) Injection

Aliqopa (copanlisib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

Aliqopa is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) with inhibitory activity predominantly against PI3K-α and PI3K-δ isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. Aliqopa has been shown to induce tumor cell death by apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of primary malignant B cell lines. Aliqopa inhibits several key cell-signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor signaling, CXCR12 mediated chemotaxis of malignant B cells, and NFκB signaling in lymphoma cell lines.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Infections: Serious, including fatal, infections occurred in 19% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. The most common serious infection was pneumonia. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and withhold ALIQOPA for Grade 3 and higher infection.

Serious pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) infection occurred in 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Before initiating treatment with ALIQOPA, consider PJP prophylaxis for populations at risk. Withhold ALIQOPA in patients with suspected PJP infection of any grade. If confirmed, treat infection until resolution, then resume ALIQOPA at previous dose with concomitant PJP prophylaxis.

Hyperglycemia: Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia (blood glucose 250 mg/dL or greater) occurred in 41% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious hyperglycemic events occurred in 2.8% of patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels typically peaked 5 to 8 hours post-infusion and subsequently declined to baseline levels for a majority of patients; blood glucose levels remained elevated in 17.7% of patients one day after ALIQOPA infusion. Of 155 patients with baseline HbA1c <5.7%, 16 (10%) patients had HbA1c >6.5% at the end of treatment.

Of the twenty patients with diabetes mellitus treated in CHRONOS-1, seven developed Grade 4 hyperglycemia and two discontinued treatment. Patients with diabetes mellitus should only be treated with ALIQOPA following adequate glucose control and should be monitored closely.

Achieve optimal blood glucose control before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hyperglycemia.

Hypertension: Grade 3 hypertension (systolic 160 mmHg or greater or diastolic 100 mmHg or greater) occurred in 26% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious hypertensive events occurred in 0.9% of 317 patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hypertension. The mean change of systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to 2 hours post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 was 16.8 mmHg and 7.8 mmHg, respectively. The mean BP started decreasing approximately 2 hours post-infusion; BP remained elevated for 6 to 8 hours after the start of the ALIQOPA infusion. Optimal BP control should be achieved before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Monitor BP pre- and post-infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hypertension.

Non-infectious Pneumonitis: Non-infectious pneumonitis occurred in 5% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Withhold ALIQOPA and conduct a diagnostic examination of a patient who is experiencing pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exam. Patients with pneumonitis thought to be caused by ALIQOPA have been managed by withholding ALIQOPA and administration of systemic corticosteroids. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of non-infectious pneumonitis.

Neutropenia: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 24% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious neutropenic events occurred in 1.3%. Monitor blood counts at least weekly during treatment with ALIQOPA. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of neutropenia.

Severe Cutaneous Reaction: Grade 3 and 4 cutaneous reactions occurred in 2.8% and 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy respectively. Serious cutaneous reaction events were reported in 0.9%. The reported events included dermatitis exfoliative, exfoliative rash, pruritus, and rash (including maculo-papular rash). Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of severe cutaneous reactions.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, ALIQOPA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of copanlisib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal death and fetal abnormalities in rats at maternal doses as low as 0.75 mg/kg/day (4.5 mg/m2/day body surface area) corresponding to approximately 12% the recommended dose for patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.

Adverse Drug Reactions: Serious adverse reactions were reported in 44 (26%) patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions that occurred were pneumonia (8%), pneumonitis (5%) and hyperglycemia (5%). Adverse reactions resulted in dose reduction in 36 (21%) and discontinuation in 27 (16%) patients. The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (≥20%) in ALIQOPA-treated patients were: hyperglycemia (54%), leukopenia (36%), diarrhea (36%), decreased general strength and energy (36%), hypertension (35%), neutropenia (32%), nausea (26%), thrombocytopenia (22%), and lower respiratory tract infections (21%).

Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers. Reduce the ALIQOPA dose to 45 mg when concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors.

Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed. Advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with ALIQOPA and for at least 1 month after the last dose.

About Detectnet

IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

 

Radiation Risk

Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including Detectnet, contribute to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.

 

Risk for Image Misinterpretation

The uptake of copper Cu 64 dotatate reflects the level of somatostatin receptor density in NETs, however, uptake can also be seen in a variety of other tumors that also express somatostatin receptors. Increased uptake might also be seen in other non-cancerous pathologic conditions that express somatostatin receptors including thyroid disease or in subacute inflammation, or might occur as a normal physiologic variant (e.g. uncinate process of the pancreas).

 

A negative scan after the administration of Detectnet in patients who do not have a history of NET disease does not rule out disease.

 

ADVERSE REACTIONS

 

In clinical trials, adverse reactions occurred at a rate of < 2% and included nausea, vomiting and flushing. In published trials nausea immediately after injection was observed.

 

DRUG INTERACTIONS

 

Somatostatin Analogs

Non-radioactive somatostatin analogs and copper Cu 64 dotatate competitively bind to somatostatin receptors (SSTR2). Image patients just prior to dosing with somatostatin analogs. For patients on long-acting somatostatin analogs, a wash-out period of 28 days is recommended prior to imaging. For patients on short-acting somatostatin analogs, a washout period of 2 days is recommended prior to imaging.

 

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

 

Pregnancy

All radiopharmaceuticals, including Detectnet, have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risks of fetal exposure to radiation from administration of Detectnet.

 

Lactation

Advise a lactating woman to interrupt breastfeeding for 12 hours after Detectnet administration in order to minimize radiation exposure to a breastfed infant.

 

Pediatric use

The safety and effectiveness of Detectnet have not been established in pediatric patients.

 

Geriatric use

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

 

OVERDOSAGE

In the event of a radiation overdose, the absorbed dose to the patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by reinforced hydration and frequent bladder voiding. A diuretic might also be considered.

About Neuroendocrine Tumors

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of rare neoplasms that originate from neuroendocrine cells. These neoplasms occur mostly in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and liver, but can also occur in other tissues including lung, thymus and other uncommon sites such as cervix, heart and prostate. Most NETs strongly express somatostatin receptors (SSTRs).

 The most common AE’s (≥15.0%) observed in patients were dizziness/vertigo, nausea, constipation, headache, somnolence, vomiting, and pruritus
 Qdolo is indicated in adults for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. It will be available at chain, independent, and specialty pharmacies","ATHENS, Ga., Sept. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Athena Bioscience, LLC, a specialty pharmaceutical company, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved QDOLO™ (tramadol hydrochloride) Oral Solution 5mg/1mL C-IV, an opioid agonist indicated in adults for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 50 million adults in the United States have chronic daily pain, with 19.6 million adults experiencing high-impact chronic pain that interferes with daily life or work activities. A May, 2019 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report on pain management best practices emphasized the need for an “individualized, patient-centered” approach for the treatment of pain.1

“As an oral liquid, QDOLO gives physicians flexibility to titrate dosing precisely according to individual patients’ needs,” said Jeff Bryant, President and CEO of Athena Bioscience. “In addition, for patients with swallowing disfunction (dysphagia) or who simply have trouble swallowing pills, QDOLO provides an essential alternative to other forms of tramadol.” QDOLO has a patent pending.

QDOLO (NDC: 71511-301-16) will be available at chain, independent, and specialty pharmacies.

INDICATION
QDOLO is indicated in adults for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

Limitations of Use: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, reserve QDOLO for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics):

Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated.
Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering QDOLO to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed.
When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume.

 Eton expects Alkindi Sprinkle to be commercially available in the Q4’ 2020 and it will be available in four strengths: 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, and 5mg, to give greater dosing flexibility to clinicians
 Alkindi Sprinkle is the 1st and only FDA-approved granular hydrocortisone formulation for the treatment of adrenocortical insufficiency specifically designed for use in children","-ALKINDI SPRINKLE is the first and only FDA-approved granular hydrocortisone formulation for adrenocortical insufficiency specifically designed for children

-Eton expects ALKINDI SPRINKLE to be available in the fourth quarter of 2020

DEER PARK, Ill., Sept. 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Nasdaq: ETON), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative treatments for rare pediatric diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ALKINDI® SPRINKLE (hydrocortisone) oral granules as replacement therapy for Adrenocortical Insufficiency (AI) in children under 17 years of age. ALKINDI SPRINKLE is the first and only FDA-approved granular hydrocortisone formulation for the treatment of adrenocortical insufficiency specifically designed for use in children.

“The FDA approval of ALKINDI SPRINKLE is a breakthrough for patients and caregivers treating pediatric adrenocortical insufficiency. We are excited to offer an FDA-approved product that enables low dosing and administration of hydrocortisone to pediatric patients,” said Sean Brynjelsen, CEO of Eton Pharmaceuticals. “We look forward to making the product available to patients in the coming months.”

“For years, we heard from parents about their struggle to provide the right dose to their child,” said Dina M. Matos, Executive Director of the CARES Foundation. “We are thrilled the FDA has approved ALKINDI SPRINKLE for pediatric patients with Adrenocortical Insufficiency including patients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, a type of Adrenocortical Insufficiency.”

The FDA approval of ALKINDI SPRINKLE was supported by six clinical studies, including the first and only interventional Phase III study of oral hydrocortisone for Pediatric AI in neonates to children under eight years of age. Prior to the approval of ALKINDI SPRINKLE, oral hydrocortisone was only FDA-approved in tablet formulations of 5mg and stronger. Many pediatric patients require significantly lower doses and the flexibility of precision titration. ALKINDI SPRINKLE will be available in 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, and 5mg strengths, allowing clinicians greater flexibility to individualize dosing based on each patient’s needs in accordance with the instructions for dosage and administration.

Eton expects ALKINDI SPRINKLE to be commercially available in the fourth quarter of 2020.

About Pediatric Adrenocortical Insufficiency
Pediatric adrenocortical Insufficiency (AI) is a rare disease characterized by an inability to synthesize and release cortisol, and sometimes aldosterone. This causes excessive androgens (abnormal sexual development in females, premature puberty, premature growth termination and short stature). The most common form of pediatric AI is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), which is caused by a genetic defect. Patients with primary or central (secondary and tertiary) AI lack appropriate levels of cortisol in their system. Diminished cortisol in the system may result in deadly consequences like adrenal crisis. To survive, patients with AI must replace the missing cortisol daily. Eton estimates that pediatric AI effects between 5,000 and 11,000 children in the United States.

About ALKINDI SPRINKLE
ALKINDI SPRINKLE is an immediate-release oral hydrocortisone granule preparation that has been specifically designed to meet the dosing needs of pediatric patients with adrenocortical insufficiency. Prior to ALKINDI SPRINKLE’s approval, parent caregivers had to cut or split higher strength hydrocortisone tablets to achieve the lower doses required for small children, which could result in inaccurate dosing. ALKINDI SPRINKLE is manufactured using commercially proven technology in four strengths: 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg and 5mg, to give greater dosing flexibility to clinicians. Taste-masking excipients that are acceptable for pediatric use eliminate the bitter taste of hydrocortisone. ALKINDI SPRINKLE has a shelf life of three years at ambient temperature and does not require refrigeration.

Indications and Usage
ALKINDI SPRINKLE is a corticosteroid indicated as replacement therapy in pediatric patients with adrenocortical insufficiency.

Important Safety Information

Contraindications

ALKINDI SPRINKLE is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or to any of the ingredients in ALKINDI SPRINKLE. Anaphylactic reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroids.

Warning and Precautions

Adrenal Crisis: Undertreatment or sudden discontinuation of therapy may lead to adrenal insufficiency, adrenal crisis and death. Adrenal crisis may also be induced by stress events such as infections or surgery. Increase the dose during periods of stress. Switch patients who are vomiting, severely ill or unable to take oral medications to parenteral corticosteroid formulations.
Infections: Excessive doses may increase the risks of new infections or exacerbation of latent infections with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infections. Treat all infections seriously and initiate stress dosing of steroids early.
Growth Retardation: Long-term use in excessive doses may cause growth retardation. Use the minimum dosage of ALKINDI SPRINKLE to achieve desired clinical response and monitor the patient’s growth.
Cushing’s Syndrome Due to Use of Excessive Doses of Corticosteroids: Prolonged use with supraphysiologic doses may cause Cushing’s syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome every 6 months; pediatric patients under one year of age may require more frequent monitoring.
Decrease in Bone Mineral Density: Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption which may lead to inhibition of bone growth and development of osteoporosis. Use the minimum dosage of ALKINDI SPRINKLE to achieve desired clinical response.
Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: Use may be associated with severe psychiatric adverse reactions such as euphoria, mania, psychosis with hallucinations and delirium or depression. Symptoms typically emerge within a few days or weeks of starting the treatment. Most reactions resolve after either dose reduction or withdrawal, although specific treatment may be necessary. Monitor patients for behavioral and mood disturbances during treatment. Instruct caregivers and/or patients to seek medical advice if psychiatric symptoms develop.
Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: Cataracts, glaucoma and central serous chorioretinopathy have been reported with prolonged use of high doses. Monitor patients for blurred vision or other visual disturbances and if they occur, refer them to an ophthalmologist.
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Increased risk in patients with certain gastrointestinal disorders. Signs and symptoms may be masked.
Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions for corticosteroids include fluid retention, alteration in glucose tolerance, elevation in blood pressure, behavioral and mood changes, increased appetite and weight gain.

50427,Eli Lilly Pauses Enrollment in ACTIV-3 Clinical Trial Due to Safety Concerns,Lilly Statement on the NIAID Decision to Pause Enrollment in ACTIV-3 Clinical Trial,"The independent DSMB recommended pausing the enrollment of the ACTIV-3 clinical trial. The trial is evaluating Lilly’s bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555, 7000mg) + remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, and is sponsored by the NIAID
 Lilly trusts the judgment & supports independent DSMB decisions to exercise caution in ensuring the safety of the patients participating in the study. DSMB also considered the impact of the ACTIV-3 study pause on ACTIV-2 and did not recommend any changes to that study’s design or enrollment
 Lilly is testing both single Ab therapy, as well as combinations of Abs as potential therapeutics for COVID-19, across two different patient populations in P-II BLAZE-1, P-III BLAZE-2, and ACTIV-2 study. These trials are not affected by the enrollment pause in the ACTIV-3 clinical trial","ACTIV-3 is an independent, NIH-sponsored study in hospitalized patients testing bamlanivimab (LYCoV555) in combination with remdesivir

+ Independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) recommended pause

+ Pause impacts the ACTIV-3 study of a Lilly neutralizing antibody; all other studies continue

+ Lilly’s other ongoing studies focus on earlier stages of COVID-19 disease or prophylaxis

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lilly has brought the full force of our scientific capabilities to fight this new disease, collaborating with the U.S. government and industry partners to discover potential treatments. Together, we have sought to learn about the potential impact of neutralizing antibodies across the broadest set of patients even as we were still evolving in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virus pathology. As always, we have remained deeply committed to patient safety.

What We Know Now
As of last evening, Lilly continued to be in communication with the trial sponsor regarding the recommendation from the independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) of the ACTIV-3 clinical trial to pause enrollment of the study. ACTIV-3, which is evaluating Lilly’s investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) as a treatment for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

At this time, only the DSMB has reviewed the data from the trial, and NIH leadership and Lilly remain blinded to the ongoing trial results. Lilly trusts the judgment of the independent DSMB and supports its decisions to exercise caution in ensuring the safety of the patients participating in this study.

Importantly, the DSMB also considered the impact of the ACTIV-3 study pause on ACTIV-2 and did not recommend any changes to that study’s design or enrollment.

What Differentiates ACTIV-3 from Other Bamlanivimab Studies
The ACTIV-3 clinical trial is the only ongoing study evaluating the efficacy of Lilly’s neutralizing antibody in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the most advanced stage of the disease. The dose of bamlanivimab being investigated in this trial is 7000 mg.

Individuals in the ACTIV-3 study have been infected with the virus for a longer period of time and may have more severe symptoms than patients studied in other bamlanivimab trials. Hospitalized patients receive different treatments for COVID-19 than earlier stage patients, including treatment with the antiviral medicine remdesivir.

For these reasons, hospitalized patients may have less benefit from neutralizing antibodies, which are a supplement to the patients’ own immune system, as they may have developed their own endogenous antibody response and be in a phase of disease characterized by inflammatory responses to virus. This is why the use of immunosuppressive treatments is both widespread and still being investigated in hospitalized patients.

Lilly’s Neutralizing Antibody Development Program
Lilly is testing both single antibody therapy, as well as combinations of antibodies as potential therapeutics for COVID-19, across two different patient populations.

Lilly’s development program includes:

BLAZE-1, an ongoing Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (NCT04427501). This trial is testing both bamlanivimab alone and in combination with a second antibody (etesevimab, LY-CoV016)
BLAZE-2, a Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention (prophylaxis) of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (NCT04497987)
Bamlanivimab is also being tested in the NIH-led ACTIV-2 study in recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 patients.
These trials are not affected by the enrollment pause in the NIH-sponsored trial of hospitalized patients.

The population where Lilly has efficacy data for neutralizing antibodies is in recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 illness in high-risk patients. In this population, we also have a large safety database inclusive of over 480 drug-treated patients across a broad dose range and have reported a potential benefit in clinical outcomes with a reduction in viral load and rates of symptoms and hospitalizations. In the BLAZE-1 trial, rates and types of adverse events were similar between bamlanivimab and placebo, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity and with no drug-related serious adverse events reported thus far. In other bamlanivimab studies, there have been isolated drug-related infusion reactions or hypersensitivity that were generally mild (two reported as serious infusion reactions, both patients recovered).

Next Steps
The scientific development process is challenging and unpredictable. It takes collaboration and commitment from scientists, researchers, patients, and companies across the biopharmaceutical industry to discover and develop treatments for diseases such as COVID-19. Every trial, no matter what it reveals, advances medical science and understanding – ultimately bringing new solutions one step closer to reality.

While we await additional data to help us understand whether neutralizing antibodies could play a role in helping hospitalized patients, we remain confident in the potential benefits of neutralizing antibodies in patients earlier in the disease course of COVID-19. We are grateful to the patients, physicians, and staff who have participated in our ongoing clinical trials. We continue to believe that the data generated in those clinical studies could support both the therapeutic benefits and safety profile of our neutralizing antibody in ambulatory patients and in prophylaxis.

Lilly Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This statement contains forward-looking statements (as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) about Lilly’s neutralizing antibodies bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) and etesevimab (LY-CoV016) as potential treatments for patients with or at risk of infection from COVID-19 and reflects Lilly’s current beliefs. However, as with any such undertaking, there are substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of drug development and commercialization. Among other things, there can be no guarantee that studies will complete as planned, that future study results will be consistent with the results to date, that bamlanivimab and etesevimab will prove to be safe and effective treatments or preventatives for COVID-19, that bamlanivimab and etesevimab will receive regulatory approvals or authorizations, or that we can provide an adequate supply of bamlanivimab and etesevimab in all circumstances. For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from Lilly’s expectations, please see Lilly’s most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

50461,Eli Lily to Acquire Disarm Therapeutics for ~$1.36B,Lilly Announces Agreement to Acquire Disarm Therapeutics,"Lilly to acquire Disarm for $135M upfront and ~$1.225B as potential development regulatory and commercial milestones, making a total deal value of ~1.36B
 The acquisition will expand Lilly’s R&D efforts in pain and neurodegeneration with the addition of Disarm’s preclinical SARM1 programs for axonal degeneration
 Disarm is advancing its potent SARM1 inhibitors in preclinical development intending to deliver patients with peripheral neuropathy and other neurological diseases like ALS and MS","INDIANAPOLIS and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 15, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced a definitive agreement to acquire Disarm Therapeutics, a privately-held biotechnology company creating a new class of disease-modifying therapeutics for patients with axonal degeneration. Disarm has discovered novel, potent SARM1 inhibitors and is advancing them in preclinical development, with the goal of delivering breakthrough treatments to patients with peripheral neuropathy and other neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis.

Axonal degeneration is a common, yet unaddressed, pathology in a broad range of neurological diseases and is known to cause severe sensory, motor, and cognitive symptoms. Disarm’s scientific founders, Dr. Jeffrey Milbrandt and Dr. Aaron DiAntonio of Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, discovered that the SARM1 protein is a central driver of axonal degeneration. Disarm’s SARM1 inhibitors are designed to directly prevent the loss of axons.

Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly will acquire Disarm for an upfront payment of $135.0 million. Disarm equityholders may be eligible for up to $1.225 billion in additional future payments for potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones should Lilly successfully develop and commercialize new medicines resulting from the acquisition.

50469,Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma,FDA Approves Expanded Indication for Merck’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL),"The approval is based on P-III KEYNOTE-204 study assessing Keytruda (200mg, IV, q3w vs BV (1.8 mg/kg, IV, q3w) in 304 patients in a ratio (1:1) with r/r cHL after at least one multi-agent CT regimen
 Results: reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 35%, median PFS (13.2mos. vs 3mos); ORR (66% vs 54%); DOR (20.7 mos. vs 13.8mos.). The approval is reviewed under the FDA’s Project Orbis
 Ketruda is a humanized mAb that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 & PD-L2 thus activating T lymphocytes that affect tumor cells & healthy cells. Additionally, the US FDA has approved an updated pediatric indication for refractory cHL or cHL that has relapsed after two or more lines of therapy","October 15, 2020 06:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time
KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expanded label for KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-204 trial in which KEYTRUDA significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.48-0.88; p<0.0027]) compared to brentuximab vedotin (BV). Additionally, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.2 months (95% CI, 10.9-19.4) for patients treated with KEYTRUDA and 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.7-8.8) for patients treated with BV. The FDA also approved an updated pediatric indication for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of pediatric patients with refractory cHL, or cHL that has relapsed after two or more lines of therapy.

“An estimated 8,500 patients in the U.S., many of them 40 years of age or younger, will be diagnosed with cHL this year. Now patients with cHL who progress after frontline therapy have a new option in KEYTRUDA, which has demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival compared to brentuximab vedotin,” said Dr. Vicki Goodman, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “At Merck, we are committed to improving outcomes for patients with cancer. Today’s FDA approval builds upon our growing range of options for people with blood cancers.”

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.

“The patients with cHL who do not achieve remission following initial treatment or who relapse after transplantation face a poor prognosis, reflecting the unmet need for improved therapies in the relapsed/refractory setting,” said Dr. John Kuruvilla, hematologist and associate professor of medicine, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and University of Toronto. “With this approval, KEYTRUDA has the potential to change the current standard of care and help these patients achieve better outcomes.”

KEYTRUDA was previously approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval process for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory cHL, or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy based on data from the KEYNOTE-087 trial. In accordance with accelerated approval regulations, continued approval was contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit; these accelerated approval requirements have been fulfilled with the data from KEYNOTE-204.

This approval was reviewed under the FDA’s Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among its international partners. For this application, a modified Project Orbis was undertaken, and the FDA is collaborating with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Health Canada on their ongoing review of the application.

Data Supporting the Approval
The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-204 (NCT02684292), a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 304 patients with relapsed or refractory cHL. The trial enrolled adults with relapsed or refractory disease after at least one multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks or BV 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks.

Treatment was continued until unacceptable toxicity, documented disease progression or a maximum of 35 cycles (up to approximately two years). Disease assessment was performed every 12 weeks. Randomization was stratified by prior autologous HSCT (yes vs. no) and disease status after frontline therapy (primary refractory vs. relapse less than 12 months after completion vs. relapse 12 months or more after completion). The main efficacy measure was PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using 2007 revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria.

Patients were enrolled and randomized to KEYTRUDA (n=151) or BV (n=153). The study population characteristics were median age of 35 years (range, 18 to 84); 57% male; 77% white, 9% Asian and 3.9% Black. The median number of prior therapies was two (range, 1 to 10) in the KEYTRUDA arm and three (range, 1 to 11) in the BV arm, with 18% in both arms having one prior line. Forty-two percent of patients were refractory to the last prior therapy, 29% had primary refractory disease, 37% had prior autologous HSCT, 5% had received prior BV, and 39% had prior radiation therapy.

In KEYNOTE-204, KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.48-0.88; p=0.0027]) and showed a median PFS of 13.2 months (95% CI, 10.9-19.4). Median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.7-8.8) for patients treated with BV. For PFS, in the KEYTRUDA arm, there were 81 patients (54%) with an event versus 88 patients (58%) in the BV arm. For patients treated with KEYTRUDA, the objective response rate (ORR) was 66% (95% CI, 57-73), with a complete response rate of 25% and a partial response rate of 41%. For patients treated with BV, the ORR was 54% (95% CI, 46-62), with a complete response rate of 24% and a partial response rate of 30%. The difference in ORRs is not statistically significant. Among the responding patients, median duration of response (DOR) was 20.7 months (range, 0.0+ to 33.2+) with KEYTRUDA and 13.8 months (range, 0.0+ to 33.9+) with BV.

In KEYNOTE-204, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 10 months (range, 1 day to 2.2 years), with 68% receiving at least six months of treatment and 48% receiving at least one year of treatment. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients who received KEYTRUDA. Serious adverse reactions in those greater than or equal to 1% of patients included pneumonitis, pneumonia, pyrexia, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, febrile neutropenia and sepsis. Three patients (2%) died from causes other than disease progression: two from complications after allogeneic HSCT and one from an unknown cause.

Permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of patients; 7% of patients discontinued treatment due to pneumonitis. Dosage interruption of KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 30% of patients. Adverse reactions that required dosage interruption in greater than or equal to 3% of patients were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonitis, transaminase increase and pneumonia. Thirty-eight percent of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20%) were upper respiratory tract infection (41%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), diarrhea (22%), and pyrexia, fatigue, rash and cough (20% each).

About Hodgkin Lymphoma
Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that develops in the white blood cells called lymphocytes, which are part of the immune system. Hodgkin lymphoma can start almost anywhere – most often in lymph nodes in the upper part of the body, with the most common sites being in the chest, neck or under the arms. Worldwide, there were approximately 80,000 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma, and more than 26,000 people died from the disease in 2018. In 2020, it is estimated nearly 8,500 people will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for more than nine in 10 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma in developed countries.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and post-marketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risk of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

About risdiplam
Risdiplam is an investigational, oral medicine designed to increase and sustain survival motor neuron (SMN) protein levels in the central nervous system and throughout the body. It is designed to help the SMN2 gene produce more functional SMN protein to better support motor neurons and muscle function. Risdiplam was approved in the U.S. in August 2020. Orphan Drug status has been granted in the EU, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation for risdiplam in December 2018 for the treatment of SMA. In Japan, risdiplam has been designated as an orphan drug for the treatment of SMA in March 2019.

About spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disease that causes muscular atrophy and muscle weakness due to degeneration of the spinal motor nerve cells.1) It is the most frequently observed life-threatening genetic disease in infants.2) The incidence of SMA from infancy to childhood is one to two in 100,000 individuals.3) The causative gene for SMA is the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. The disease develops because of insufficient production of functional SMN protein from SMN2 genes alone, in addition to the dysfunction of the SMN1 gene.4)

50484,Sanofi and Translate Bio to Advance MRT5500 into Clinical Study Against COVID-19,Sanofi and Translate Bio mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate induced high antibody levels in preclinical studies,"The companies reported the preclinical results of MRT5500 demonstrating the potential of the vaccine in neutralizing the Abs against SARS-CoV-2. The two doses of MRT5500 induced neutralizing antibody levels significantly higher than those observed in COVID-19 patients
 The preclinical data support the advancement of MRT5500 for clinical development. The companies anticipate the initiation of P-I/II study in Q4’20
 MRT5500 is being developed under the collaboration between Sanofi Pasteur and Translate Bio and has demonstrated its ability to elicit an immune response in both mice and non-human primates in a preclinical study","PARIS and LEXINGTON, MASS. – October 15, 2020 – Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, and Translate Bio (NASDAQ: TBIO), a clinical-stage messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics company, today announced the preclinical results for MRT5500, a mRNA-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease.

Preclinical evaluation of MRT5500, importantly, demonstrated a favorable immune response profile against SARS-CoV-2. These data support the selection of MRT5500 for clinical development. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2020. Full results are available here. MRT5500 is being developed under a collaboration agreement between Sanofi Pasteur and Translate Bio.

“To tackle this global pandemic, we must look to both the strong knowledge we have from years of infectious disease expertise and the promise of new, innovative technologies,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur. “Today’s presentation of these positive results is another development milestone for providing a safe and effective potential vaccine against SARS-CoV2 and shows how promising this technology is. We are looking forward to working on next steps with our partner Translate Bio to bring this technology to people worldwide.”

“The rapid development of effective vaccines to address the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be an urgent global public health need and I am encouraged by the progress we’ve made to date with our partner Sanofi Pasteur toward the development of a promising mRNA vaccine candidate,” said Ronald Renaud, Chief Executive Officer at Translate Bio. “The preclinical results we report in this paper demonstrate the ability of MRT5500 to elicit a favorable immune response in both mice and non-human primates. Importantly, these results provide additional support for using our mRNA platform to potentially expedite the development of alternative approaches to traditional vaccines.”

Key preclinical findings
The main findings of the preclinical studies demonstrate the potential of MRT5500 to elicit neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

In mice, four dose levels were assessed at 0.2, 1, 5 and 10 µg per dose using a two-dose vaccination schedule, administered three weeks apart. MRT5500 induced dose-dependent levels of binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 100% seroconversion was observed at all dose levels after one administration, and a further increase in titers was observed following a second administration. Neutralizing antibody titers were observed across all dose levels after receiving the two-dose-administration regimen. In the higher dose groups (5 µg, 10 µg), titers were detected after one administration of MRT5500 and were more pronounced after the second administration.

In non-human primates (NHPs), three dose levels were assessed at 15, 45 and 135 µg per dose using a two-administration vaccination schedule, three weeks apart. The potency of MRT5500 was assessed by two types of neutralization assays: pseudovirus neutralization and micro-neutralization. After the first administration, the majority of NHPs developed neutralizing antibodies reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and those antibody titers were further enhanced after a second administration with 100% of NHPs reaching levels significantly higher than those from human convalescent sera by day 35.

It was also demonstrated that MRT5500-immunized mice and non-human primates exhibited a Th1-biased T cell response against SARS-CoV-2.

The preprint publication “Immunogenicity of novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccine MRT5500 in mice and non-human primates,” is available here.

Shots on goal in the fight against COVID-19
In addition to the mRNA vaccine candidate in collaboration with Translate Bio, Sanofi is collaborating with GSK on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate using the same recombinant protein-based manufacturing technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines, combined with GSK’s established pandemic adjuvant platform. The Companies announced the start of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for their adjuvanted recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate in September and anticipate first results in early December 2020, to support the initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 study before the end of the year.

About mRNA vaccines 
Vaccines work by mimicking disease agents to stimulate the immune system, building up a defense mechanism that remains active in the body to fight future infections. mRNA vaccines offer an innovative approach by delivering a nucleotide sequence encoding the antigen or antigens selected for their high potential to induce a protective immune response. mRNA vaccines also represent a potentially innovative alternative to conventional vaccine approaches for several reasons – their high potency, ability to initiate protein production without the need for nuclear entry, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration using non-viral delivery. This approach potentially enables the development of vaccines for disease areas where vaccination is not a viable option today. Additionally, a desired antigen or multiple antigens can be expressed from mRNA without the need to adjust the production process, offering maximum flexibility and efficiency in development.

About the Sanofi Pasteur and Translate Bio collaboration
In 2018, Translate Bio entered into a collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Sanofi Pasteur Inc., the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, to develop mRNA vaccines for up to five infectious disease pathogens. The agreement was first expanded in March 2020 to include development of a novel mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. In June 2020, the two Companies built upon the existing collaboration to pursue novel mRNA vaccines to broadly address current and future infectious diseases.

This collaboration brings together Sanofi Pasteur’s leadership in vaccines and Translate Bio’s mRNA research and development expertise. Under the agreement, the Companies are jointly conducting research and development activities to advance mRNA vaccines and mRNA vaccine platform development during a research term of at least four years after the original signing in 2018.

About Translate Bio
Translate Bio is a clinical-stage mRNA therapeutics company developing a new class of potentially transformative medicines to treat diseases caused by protein or gene dysfunction, or to prevent infectious diseases by generating protective immunity. Translate Bio is primarily focused on applying its technology to treat pulmonary diseases caused by insufficient protein production or where the reduction of proteins can modify disease. Translate Bio’s lead pulmonary candidate is being evaluated as an inhaled treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Additional pulmonary diseases are being evaluated in discovery-stage research programs that utilize a proprietary lung delivery platform. Translate Bio believes that mRNA can be delivered to target tissues via multiple routes of administration and, consequently, its technology may apply broadly to a wide range of diseases, including diseases that affect the liver. Translate Bio is also pursuing the development of mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases under a collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur.

 No difference in 2EPS including clinical outcomes, the therapy was generally well-tolerated by patients in the P-II study","Mechelen, Belgium and Paris, France, 15 OCTOBER 2020, 22.01 CET; regulated information –Servier and Galapagos NV (Euronext & NASDAQ: GLPG) report that no signal of activity was observed in the topline results in their ROCCELLA Phase 2 trial with GLPG1972/S201086.

ROCCELLA is a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of three different once-daily oral doses of GLPG1972/S201086 in 932 patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) over 52 weeks of treatment. The study population was aged between 40 to 76 years (mean age was 63), mainly female (70%), and with a mean disease duration of 7 years.

The primary objective of ROCCELLA was to demonstrate the efficacy of at least one dose of GLPG1972/S201086 compared to placebo after 52 weeks of treatment in reducing cartilage loss of the central medial tibiofemoral compartment of the target knee via quantitative MRI.

The trial failed to meet the primary objective. The change from baseline to week 52 in cartilage thickness, in mm (SD) was -0.116 (0.27) for the placebo group and -0.068 (0.20), -0.097 (0.27) and -0.085 (0.22), for the low, medium and high dose, respectively. Statistically significant difference versus placebo was not reached in any of the treated groups.

There was no significant difference compared to placebo observed on secondary endpoints, including clinical outcomes.

Additional analyses are being conducted to fully evaluate the results, which will be presented at upcoming medical conferences.

GLPG1972/S201086 was generally well-tolerated by patients in this Phase 2 trial.

“While we are disappointed that ADAMTS-5 inhibition by GLPG1972/S201086 proved not to make a difference in this trial, we want to express our gratitude to all participating patients and investigators. This study result, while not what we hoped for, does add to the body of knowledge to help fight OA, a disease with substantial unmet medical need,” said Dr. Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer of Galapagos.

“We are pleased to have performed this study with Galapagos. Unfortunately, the ROCCELLA results provided insufficient evidence of GLPG1972/S201086 efficacy in patients with knee osteoarthritis. We acknowledge the importance of assessing this innovative mechanism of action in the clinical setting and we will continue analyzing the data for better knowledge of the disease for the benefit of the patients and for future developments. We would like also to thank all patients and investigators for participating in this very important study,” said Dr. Patricia Belissa-Mathiot, Director of Clinical Development and R&D Chief Medical Officer at Servier.

 Luxturna is designed to provide functioning copies of the RPE65 gene to act in place of mutated RPE65 genes. The functioning genes work to restore vision and improve sight, giving patients the potential for greater independence
 Novartis has entered a partnership with Blueprint Genetics to facilitate the genetic testing where appropriate to validate the diagnosis","DORVAL, QC, Oct. 15, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ – Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. is pleased to announce that Health Canada has approved Luxturna® (voretigene neparvovec), a one-time gene therapy for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations and who have sufficient viable retinal cells. The presence of biallelic RPE65 mutations should be confirmed by an accredited laboratory using validated assay methods1.

Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a group of blinding conditions caused by mutations in more than 270 different genes, including the RPE65 gene3. RPE65-mediated IRDs often disproportionally affect children and young adults and cause progressive vision loss, leading to complete blindness in almost all patients 2. Luxturna is designed to provide functioning copies of the RPE65 gene to act in place of mutated RPE65 genes2. These functioning genes produce the RPE65 protein to help improve vision and prevent progression towards total blindness2.

“The effects of RPE65-mediated inherited retinal diseases can be life-changing. Previously, there was no treatment available and the progression towards complete blindness was inevitable.” said Dr. Elise Héon, an Ophthalmologist in the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences and the Director of the Eye Genetics Program at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto. “This approval is a very important step forward in the treatment of genetic eye disorders.”

Due to the highly specialized nature of the therapy, Novartis is collaborating with key centres and their multidisciplinary teams to deliver Luxturna to patients across Canada: SickKids in partnership with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Ontario, and Montreal Children’s Hospital, McGill University Health Centre in partnership with Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital (HMR), Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux (CIUSSS) de l’Est-de-l’Île-de-Montréal, affiliated with Université de Montréal in Quebec.

“Being part of tremendous innovations in the treatment of certain eye conditions over the past decades has been incredibly rewarding. Gene therapy heralds the start of a new era for IRDs and I’m thrilled to be part of this historic moment and equally excited to be able to give patients a chance to regain sight with Luxturna,” said Dr. Peter Kertes, retina surgeon and Ophthalmologist-in-Chief, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and staff ophthalmologist at SickKids in Toronto.

The current standard of care for people born with IRDs caused by RPE65 gene mutations is supportive in nature and focuses on monitoring, psychological support, mobility training and visual rehabilitation4. Until now, no pharmacological treatment option was available to treat the underlying disease mechanism or alter the natural history of inherited retinal dystrophies. While a genetic test is needed to confirm that vision loss is caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene2, it can be a lengthy process to access testing and counselling. Novartis has entered into a partnership with Blueprint Genetics to help facilitate genetic testing where appropriate in order to validate the diagnosis.

“The approval of the first gene replacement therapy for Canadians is historical. We have been waiting for this moment in the vision community for decades. To be able to tell a parent that their child’s impaired sight could now be restored or improved is remarkable,’ said Doug Earle, President & CEO of Fighting Blindness Canada. “We welcome this medical innovation and hope that Canadians in need of this therapy have access to it without delay.”

“Novartis is proudly reimagining medicine by bringing forward innovations like Luxturna. Today’s approval will have a significant impact on patient care,” said Andrea Marazzi, Country Head, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada. “We are grateful to the vision community for rallying behind Canadians who are impacted by vision impairment and vision loss and we are committed to helping them gain access to this game-changing gene therapy as quickly as possible.”

About RPE65 mutation-associated inherited retinal dystrophy
Mutations in both copies of the RPE65 gene affect approximately 1 in 200,000 people and can lead to blindness5,6. Early in the disease patients can suffer from night blindness (nyctalopia), loss of light sensitivity, loss of peripheral vision, loss of sharpness or clarity of vision, impaired dark adaptation and repetitive uncontrolled movements of the eye (nystagmus)6. Patients with mutations in both copies of the RPE65 gene may be diagnosed, for instance, with subtypes of either Leber congenital amaurosis or retinitis pigmentosa7.

50565,Novartis' Leqvio (inclisiran) Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Approval to Treat Hypercholesterolemia,"Novartis receives positive CHMP opinion for Leqvio®* (inclisiran), a potential first-in-class siRNA for the treatment of high cholesterol","The CHMP’s positive opinion is based on ORION program including P-III studies assessing Leqvio in 3,600+ patients on a maximally tolerated statin dose. Inclisiran demonstrated effective and sustained LDL-C reduction of up to 52% with 2doses/yr, after an initial dose and one @3mos., in adults with ASCVD, ASCVD risk equivalent or HeFH6
 80% of high-risk patients do not reach guideline-recommended LDC-L, targets despite the widespread use of statins. Reduction in LDL-C was achieved through 17mos. with a safety and tolerability profile like PBO
 Additional post hoc analysis demonstrated 88% of them reached guideline-recommended targets at any timepoint during the study. Additionally, the therapy is also under review by the US FDA and other health authorities for primary hyperlipidemia in adults who have elevated LDL-C while being on a maximally tolerated dose of statin therapy","Basel, October 16, 2020 — Novartis announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion and recommended granting marketing authorization of Leqvio®* (inclisiran) for the treatment of adults with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, marking an important milestone towards it becoming available in the EU.

Inclisiran is a potential first-in-class small interfering RNA (siRNA) with a new mechanism of action which delivers effective and sustained low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), ASCVD risk equivalent and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) a major driver of heart attacks, strokes and deaths1.

“This investigational medicine could significantly change how high LDL-C is treated6,7,” said Professor Ulf Landmesser, M.D., Director of Charité Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Berlin. “Many patients struggle to keep their LDL-C at recommended levels, and long-term exposure to high LDL-C is a major driver of ASCVD4,8,9. The unique mechanism of action of inclisiran provides effective and sustained LDL-C reduction, a causal factor of atherosclerotic disease progression. With only two doses a year, and as an injection administered by healthcare professionals, it is anticipated to remove adherence challenges commonly encountered with self-administered treatments1,6,7,10-13.”

“LDL-C reduction remains a major public health issue, with 80% of high-risk patients in Europe not achieving guideline-recommended LDL-C targets despite available current standard of care treatments. These patients remain at risk of ASCVD events, such as strokes or heart attacks3-5”, said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “This encouraging positive CHMP opinion is a significant step in our journey of reimagining medicine with this transformational treatment, which has the potential to bring new hope to the millions of people in Europe currently unable to reach their LDL-C goals3-5.”

This CHMP opinion is based on results from the ORION clinical research program including Phase III trials, which involved more than 3,600 patients on a maximally tolerated statin dose and assessed the safety, efficacy and tolerability of inclisiran6,7. Inclisiran demonstrated effective and sustained LDL-C reduction of up to 52% (P<0.0001) with two doses per year, after an initial dose and one at 3 months, in adults with ASCVD, ASCVD risk equivalent and/or HeFH6,7. Further, the reduction in LDL-C achieved with inclisiran was sustained through 17 months, with a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo6,7. Additional post hoc analysis showed low variability among the patients treated with inclisiran: 88% of them reached guideline recommended targets at any timepoint during the study (observed values)14.

The CHMP recommended granting inclisiran marketing authorization for the treatment of adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidemia, as an adjunct to diet:

in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximally tolerated dose of a statin, or
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated.
The European Commission (EC) – which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union (EU) – will review the CHMP opinion and is expected to grant a centralized marketing authorization that will be valid in the 27 countries that are members of the EU. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, as members of the European Economic Area (EEA), will take corresponding decisions based on the EC’s recommendation. Following EC approval, Novartis will continue to explore innovative collaborations with health agencies and others throughout Europe designed to ensure that people with ASCVD and elevated LDL-C have access to the treatments they need to achieve beneficial health outcomes. Further, Novartis looks forward to the completion of the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes ORION-4 study, which will expand on the scientific evidence associating lower LDL-C levels with improved cardiovascular outcomes.

Inclisiran is also under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia (including HeFH) in adults who have elevated LDL-C while being on a maximally tolerated dose of statin therapy.

About the ORION Phase III LDL-C-lowering Studies
ORION-9 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium 300 mg administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional starting it at an initial dose6. Inclisiran was then administered again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter in 482 participants with clinical or genetic evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), despite a maximally tolerated dose of LDL-C-lowering therapies (e.g. a statin or ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-9, inclisiran delivered mean placebo-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 48% (P<.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 44% (P<.0001) from 3 through 18 months. The international study was conducted at 46 sites in eight countries6.

ORION-10 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium 300 mg administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional starting it at an initial dose7. Inclisiran was then administered again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter in 1,561 participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and elevated LDL-C, despite a maximally tolerated dose of LDL-C-lowering therapies (e.g. a statin and/or ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-10, inclisiran delivered mean placebo-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 52% (P<.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 54% (P<.0001) from 3 through 18 months. The study was conducted at 145 sites in the United States7.

ORION-11 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium 300 mg administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional starting it at an initial dose7. Inclisiran was then administered again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter in 1,617 patients with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents and elevated LDL-C despite a maximally tolerated dose of statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-11, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted change in LDL-C reductions of 50% (P<.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 49% (P<.0001) from 3 through 18 months. The international study was conducted at 70 sites in seven countries7.

About Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)
Atherosclerosis corresponds to the accumulation of lipids over time mainly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the inner lining of the arteries. Unexpected rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque can cause an atherosclerotic cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke15,16. ASCVD accounts for over 85% of all cardiovascular disease deaths17. ASCVD is the primary cause of death in the European Union and its burden in the United States is greater than that from any other chronic diseases18,19. ASCVD risk equivalent corresponds to conditions that confer a similar risk for a ASCVD event (e.g. diabetes, HeFH)7,20.

About Inclisiran
If approved, inclisiran (KJX839) would be the first and only therapy to use the small interfering RNA (siRNA mechanism) of action to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which could help improve outcomes for patients with ASCVD, a deadly form of cardiovascular disease1,6,7. With two doses a year and effective and sustained LDL-C reduction, inclisiran works as a complement to statins. Inclisiran works differently from other therapies by preventing the production of the target protein in the liver, increasing hepatic uptake of LDL-C and clearing it from the bloodstream1. Inclisiran is dosed initially, again at 3 months, and then once every 6 months. In three clinical trials, patients taking inclisiran maintained LDL-C reduction throughout each 6-month dosing interval6,7. Administered in-office as a subcutaneous injection, inclisiran integrates seamlessly into a patient’s healthcare routine6,7.

No significant safety or tolerability concerns have been identified with the long-term administration of inclisiran. In the Phase III trials, inclisiran was reported to be well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo6,7. The most common adverse reactions reported (>=3% of patients treated with inclisiran and occurring more frequently than placebo) were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, back pain, dyspnea, bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infection. Adverse events at the injection site were more frequent with inclisiran than placebo and were generally mild and none were severe or persistent6,7.

Novartis has obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize inclisiran under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a leader in RNAi therapeutics.

50574,AbbVie and Roche's Venclexta (venetoclax) Receive the US FDA's Approval for Acute Myeloid Leukemia,VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) Receives FDA Full Approval for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),"The approval is based on P-lll VIALE-A & VIALE-C studies and updated data from the P-Ib M14-358 and the P-I/II M14-387 studies. The P-III studies involve assessing of Venclexta (400mg & 600mg, qd) + azacitidine & LDAC vs PBO + azacitidine & LDAC in 431 & 211 people with previously untreated AML who are ineligible for intensive CT respectively
 VIALE-A results: Reduction in the risk of death (34%), m-OS (14.7 vs 9.6mos.), CR rate (37% vs 18%); CR+CRh rate (65% vs 23%), median duration (7.6 mos.). VIALE-C results: CR rate (27% vs 7.4%); DOCR (11.1mos. vs 8.3mos.); m-OS (7.2mos. vs 4.1mos.). In 2018, the US FDA granted accelerated approval for AML
 This is the second time that Venclexta has been reviewed under the FDA’s new RTOR and Assessment Aid pilot program. Additionally, the FDA has granted five BTD for Venclexta, two of which are for people with previously untreated AML ineligible for intensive CT","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., Oct. 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided full approval to VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) for the treatment of newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults who are age 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy. The approval is supported by data from the Phase 3 VIALE-A (M15-656) and VIALE-C (M16-043) studies and updated data from the Phase 1b M14-358 and the Phase 1/2 M14-387 studies. The FDA previously granted accelerated approval to VENCLEXTA for this indication in 2018.5

“AML is a complex and challenging disease with generally low survival rates. This approval is significant because data from our VIALE-A trial has shown that newly-diagnosed patients, who cannot undergo intensive chemotherapy, lived longer when treated with VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine than those treated with azacitidine alone,” said Mohamed Zaki, M.D., Ph.D., vice president and global head of oncology development, AbbVie. “This trial also provides physicians more information for managing patients – from treatment initiation, to assessing response and management post disease remission.”

Positive overall survival (OS) data seen at an interim analysis of the VIALE-A trial led to an early submission supporting the FDA approval of VENCLEXTA in AML. The trial showed patients on the active regimen of VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine achieved a 34% reduction in the risk of death compared to azacitidine in combination with placebo (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.66 [95% CI: 0.52-0.85], p<0.001). The median OS for patients in the VENCLEXTA arm was 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.9, 18.7) versus 9.6 months in the placebo arm (95% CI: 7.4, 12.7). Additionally, patients in the VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine arm achieved a complete remission (CR) rate of 37% (95% CI: 31%, 43%) with a median duration of CR of 18.0 months (95% CI: 15.3, -) compared with patients in the placebo plus azacitidine arm with a CR rate of 18% (95% CI: 12%, 25%) with a median duration of CR of 13.4 months (95% CI: 8.7, 17.6). The observed safety profile was generally consistent with the known safety profile of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine. For patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, the most frequent serious adverse reactions (ARs; ≥5%) at first use were febrile neutropenia (30%), pneumonia (22%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 19%) and hemorrhage (6%).1,6

Data from VIALE-A was presented for the first time as a late-breaking abstract at the 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress in June 2020 and recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine.7

“For far too long, people with AML had very few treatment options, aside from very intense chemotherapy. Today’s news continues the progress of bringing more treatment options to patients with this devastating disease,” said Lee Greenberger, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.

Data from the VIALE-C trial was presented at both the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and the EHA Annual Congress and previously published in Blood.8 The median OS for VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC was 7.2 months (95% CI: 5.6, 10.1) and 4.1 months for LDAC in combination with placebo (95% CI: 3.1, 8.8). The HR for the primary endpoint of OS was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.52-1.07; p=0.114). The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of statistically significant improvement of OS for patients with AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy at the time of the planned analysis. Efficacy was based on the rate of CR and duration of CR with supportive evidence of rate of CR + complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CR+CRh), duration of CR+CRh, and the rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence. In the VENCLEXTA arm, the most frequent serious ARs were (≥10%) pneumonia (17%), febrile neutropenia (16%) and sepsis (excluding fungal; 12%).1,9

AML is an aggressive and difficult-to-treat blood cancer with a low survival rate.2,3 Despite recent advances in available therapies, the five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with AML remains approximately 29%.10 AML typically worsens quickly, and due to age or comorbidities, not all patients are eligible to receive intensive chemotherapy.11

The FDA reviewed the clinical data under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program and Project Orbis initiative, which led to approval in the U.S. in October 2020. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international partners. The U.S. FDA, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, Swissmedic, Health Canada and ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária) collaborated on this review based on the marketing applications submitted in their respective countries.

Venetoclax is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S.

About the VIALE-A and VIALE-C Clinical Trials

VIALE-A (M15-656) Phase 3 Trial1,7

A total of 431 patients were randomized in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 VIALE-A trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (n=286) in patients with AML who are ineligible for standard induction therapy versus azacitidine in combination with placebo (n=145). The primary endpoint was OS.

The VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine combination showed a median OS of 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.9, 18.7) versus 9.6 months (95% CI: 7.4, 12.7) with azacitidine in combination with placebo. The study also met its secondary endpoints, with the VENCLEXTA combination arm resulting in a CR rate of 37% (95% CI: 31, 43) and a CR+CRh rate of 65% (95% CI: 59, 70) compared to a CR rate of 18% (95% CI: 12, 25) and a CR+CRh rate of 23% (95% CI: 16, 30) in the placebo arm. The median time to first response of CR or CRh was 1.0 months (range: 0.6 to 14.3 months) with VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine. The median duration of treatment was 7.6 months (range: <0.1 to 30.7 months) in the VENCLEXTA arm.

The most frequent ARs (≥30% with a difference between arms of ≥5%) for patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine were mostly hematologic and gastrointestinal in nature and consisted of, nausea (44%), diarrhea (43%), febrile neutropenia (42%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), and vomiting (30%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 83% of patients in the VENCLEXTA arm, with the most frequent serious ARs (≥5%) being febrile neutropenia (30%), pneumonia (22%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 19%) and hemorrhage (6%).

VIALE-C (M16-043) Phase 3 Trial1,9

A total of 211 patients were enrolled and treated in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 VIALE-C trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC (n=143) versus placebo with LDAC (n=68). The primary endpoint was OS.

VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC did not significantly improve OS versus placebo in combination with LDAC. The HR for OS was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.07); p-value 0.114. The median OS for VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC arm was 7.2 months (95% CI: 5.6, 10.1) and for PBO+LDAC arm was 4.1 months (95% CI: 3.1, 8.8).

Efficacy was based on the rate of CR and duration of CR with supportive evidence of rate of CR+CRh, duration of CR+CRh, and the rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence. The CR rate in the VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC arm was 27% (95% CI: 20%, 35%) with a median duration of CR of 11.1 months (95% CI: 6.1, -), and the CR rate in the placebo arm was 7.4% (95% CI: 2.4%, 16%) with a median duration of CR of 8.3 months (95% CI: 3.1, – ). The CR+CRh rate in the VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC arm was 47% (95% CI: 39%, 55%) and in the placebo arm was 15% (95% CI: 7.3%, 25%) with a median duration of CR+CRh of 11.1 months with VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC and 6.2 months with LDAC in combination with placebo. The median time to first response of CR or CRh was 1.0 month (range: 0.7 to 5.8 months) with VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC.

The most frequent AR (≥30% with a difference between arms of ≥5%) for patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC was nausea (42%). Serious ARs were reported in 65% of patients in the VENCLEXTA arm, with the most frequent (≥10%) being pneumonia (17%), febrile neutropenia (16%), and sepsis (excluding fungal; 12%).

About VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) 

VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) is a first-in-class medicine that selectively binds and inhibits the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers, BCL-2 prevents cancer cells from undergoing their natural death or self-destruction process, called apoptosis. VENCLEXTA targets the BCL-2 protein and works to help restore the process of apoptosis.

VENCLEXTA is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. Together, the companies are committed to BCL-2 research and to studying venetoclax in clinical trials across several blood and other cancers. VENCLEXTA is approved in more than 50 countries, including the U.S.

Uses and Important VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) U.S. Safety Information1

Uses

VENCLEXTA is a prescription medicine used:

to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).
in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine to treat adults with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who:
are 75 years of age or older, or
have other medical conditions that prevent the use of standard chemotherapy.
It is not known if VENCLEXTA is safe and effective in children.

Important Safety Information

What is the most important information I should know about VENCLEXTA?

VENCLEXTA can cause serious side effects, including:

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause kidney failure, the need for dialysis treatment, and may lead to death. Your healthcare provider will do tests to check your risk of getting TLS before you start taking VENCLEXTA. You will receive other medicines before starting and during treatment with VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of TLS. You may also need to receive intravenous (IV) fluids into your vein. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check for TLS when you first start treatment and during treatment with VENCLEXTA. It is important to keep your appointments for blood tests. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of TLS during treatment with VENCLEXTA, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, confusion, shortness of breath, seizures, irregular heartbeat, dark or cloudy urine, unusual tiredness, or muscle or joint pain.

Drink plenty of water during treatment with VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of getting TLS. Drink 6 to 8 glasses (about 56 ounces total) of water each day, starting 2 days before your first dose, on the day of your first dose of VENCLEXTA, and each time your dose is increased.

Your healthcare provider may delay, decrease your dose, or stop treatment with VENCLEXTA if you have side effects.

Who should not take VENCLEXTA?

Certain medicines must not be taken when you first start taking VENCLEXTA and while your dose is being slowly increased because of the risk of increased TLS.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the- counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. VENCLEXTA and other medicines may affect each other causing serious side effects.
Do not start new medicines during treatment with VENCLEXTA without first talking with your healthcare provider.
Before taking VENCLEXTA, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have kidney or liver problems.
have problems with your body salts or electrolytes, such as potassium, phosphorus, or calcium.
have a history of high uric acid levels in your blood or gout.
are scheduled to receive a vaccine. You should not receive a “live vaccine” before, during, or after treatment with VENCLEXTA, until your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. If you are not sure about the type of immunization or vaccine, ask your healthcare provider. These vaccines may not be safe or may not work as well during treatment with VENCLEXTA.
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. VENCLEXTA may harm your unborn baby. If you are able to become pregnant, your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with VENCLEXTA, and you should use effective birth control during treatment and for at least 30 days after the last dose of VENCLEXTA. If you become pregnant or think you are pregnant, tell your healthcare provider right away.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if VENCLEXTA passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of VENCLEXTA.
What should I avoid while taking VENCLEXTA?

You should not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit, Seville oranges (often used in marmalades), or starfruit while you are taking VENCLEXTA. These products may increase the amount of VENCLEXTA in your blood.

What are the possible side effects of VENCLEXTA?

VENCLEXTA can cause serious side effects, including:

Low white blood cell counts (neutropenia). Low white blood cell counts are common with VENCLEXTA but can also be severe. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your blood counts during treatment with VENCLEXTA and may pause dosing.
Infections. Death and serious infections such as pneumonia and blood infection (sepsis) have happened during treatment with VENCLEXTA. Your healthcare provider will closely monitor and treat you right away if you have a fever or any signs of infection during treatment with VENCLEXTA.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have a fever or any signs of an infection during treatment with VENCLEXTA.

The most common side effects of VENCLEXTA when used in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab or alone in people with CLL or SLL include low white blood cell counts; low platelet counts; low red blood cell counts; diarrhea; nausea; upper respiratory tract infection; cough; muscle and joint pain; tiredness; and swelling of your arms, legs, hands, and feet.

The most common side effects of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine or decitabine or low-dose cytarabine in people with AML include nausea, diarrhea, low platelet count, constipation, low white blood cell count, fever with low white blood cell count, tiredness, vomiting, swelling of arms, legs, hands, or feet, fever, infection in lungs, shortness of breath, bleeding, low red blood cell count, rash, stomach (abdominal) pain, infection in your blood, muscle and joint pain, dizziness, cough, sore throat, and low blood pressure.

VENCLEXTA may cause fertility problems in males. This may affect your ability to father a child. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have concerns about fertility.

These are not all the possible side effects of VENCLEXTA. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

50582,"Henlius Signs a License Agreement with Essex to Co-develop HLX04 (biosimilar, bevacizumab) for Ophthalmic Diseases","Henlius and Essex Enter into a Global Co-Development and Exclusive License Agreement, to Jointly Develop Bevacizumab to Treat Ophthalmic Diseases","Henlius to receive upfront, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments of ~$43M, eligible to receive $30M for every $1B above the first $600M of the cumulative net sales along with 10% royalties on net sales of the therapy
 Henlius will be responsible for the pre/ clinical development of HLX04, whereas Essex is responsible for regulatory filings and commercialization of HLX04 globally and will be responsible for 80% of all costs and expenses concerning to the development of HLX04. Additionally, Essex has a right to grant a sublicense to third parties, for which Henlius will receive 20% of the related sublicensing revenue
 Henlius is developing HLX04 for ophthalmic diseases, wAMD & DR. Henlius and Essex plan to conduct global clinical trials of HLX04 in China, Australia, EU & the US, & will apply MAA in different countries across the globe","Shanghai, China, October 15th, 2020- Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that the company entered into a co-development and exclusive license agreement with Essex Bio-Investment and Zhuhai Essex (collectively called Essex), two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Essex Bio-Technology Limited (Essex Bio-Technology, 1061.HK). Pursuant to the agreement, Henlius agreed to co-develop its bevacizumab HLX04 indicated for ophthalmic diseases such as wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) with Essex and to grant an exclusive license to Essex to develop, manufacture and commercialize HLX04 in the field of human ophthalmic therapies globally.
According to the agreement, Henlius will be mainly responsible for the pre-clinical and clinical development of HLX04, whereas, Essex is responsible for regulatory filings and commercialisation of HLX04 globally. Essex will be responsible for 80% of all costs and expenses in relation to the development of HLX04. After signing the agreement and upon reaching of certain milestones, Henlius is entitled to receive a signing payment and subsequent regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to US$43 million. In addition, Henlius is also entitled to receive US$30 million for every US$1 billion above the first US$600 million of the cumulative net sales. Henlius will also be eligible to receive royalties of up to 10% of the product annual net sales. Essex has a right to grant a sublicense to third parties and Henlius is entitled to receive 20% of the related sublicensing revenue, and the relevant share ratio can be adjusted through bilateral negotiation. Through this collaboration, Henlius and Essex will share the risks and costs in the development of HLX04 for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. This collaboration will fully utilize the advantages of Henlius in research and development and Essex in global commercialisation of ophthalmic drugs, to best strategize for the global development and commercialization of HLX04.
The incidence of ophthalmic diseases is increasing year by year in China, especially in the middle-aged and elderly patients. As of now, the number of patients with wAMD has exceeded 5 million in China and up to 30 million worldwide [1-2]. HLX04 (recombinant anti-VEGF humanized monoclonal antibody injection) is a bevacizumab biosimilar independently developed and manufactured by Henlius. Via specific binding with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), HLX04 can block the interaction between VEGF and its receptors, thus inhibiting angiogenesis. Results from pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated significant efficacy of VEGF inhibitors on ophthalmic diseases caused by fundus angiogenesis [3-4]. Since bevacizumab has not been approved for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases globally despite of its broad use, HLX04 has the potential to be one of the first bevacizumabs approved for these indications.
With the aim to benefit a broader patient population, Henlius is developing HLX04 for ophthalmic diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). In January 2019, the investigational new drug application (IND) of HLX04 for indications of wAMD and DR has been approved by the NMPA. With this collaboration, Henlius and Essex plan to conduct global multi-centre clinical trials of HLX04 in China, Australia, the European Union and the United States, and apply marketing authorization in different countries and regions around the globe based on the research results. Meanwhile, Henlius has submitted a patent for a new formulation of HLX04 with potential better safety and stability, designed for ophthalmic use.
In the future, Henlius will also actively collaborate with more partners to make progress by win-win cooperation and bring more high-quality and affordable biologics through consistently innovation to benefit patients around the world.

About oncology indications of HLX04


In addition to potential in the treatment of ophthalmic diseases, HLX04 is also essential for the inhibition of tumour angiogenesis, growth and metastases [5]. Recently, the phase 3 clinical trial of HLX04 in metastatic colorectal cancer has successfully met its primary and secondary endpoints and Henlius has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) of HLX04 for the treatment of advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer to the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) and has received the NDA acceptance notification from NMPA. At the same time, Henlius is also actively carrying out the clinical study of HLX04 in combination with HLX10 (an innovative anti-PD-1 mAb) of Henlius, and the indications cover multiple advanced solid tumours such as metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (phase 3 clinical trial) and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (phase 2 clinical trial).

50591,AstraZeneca's Trixeo Aerosphere Receives CHMP's Recommendation for Approval to Treat COPD,Trixeo Aerosphere recommended for approval in the EU by CHMP for the maintenance treatment of COPD,"The CHMP’s positive opinion is based on P-III ETHOS & KRONOS studies, which are a part of AstraZeneca’s P-III ATHENA program assessing Trixeo Aerosphere in 15500+ patients globally across 11 trials
 P-III ETHOS study results reported that triple-combination therapy showed a reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with the Bevespi Aerosphere over 52wks. In both trials, the safety and tolerability of Trixeo Aerosphere were consistent with the profiles of the dual comparators
 Trixeo Aerosphere is a single-inhaler, fixed-dose triple combination of formoterol fumarate, glycopyrronium bromide with budesonide, delivered in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, and is approved under the brand name Breztri Aerosphere in Japan, China & the US for COPD","AstraZeneca’s Trixeo Aerosphere (formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide/budesonide) has been recommended for marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) for maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), or a combination of a LABA and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist.

Trixeo Aerosphere, a triple-combination therapy, is approved under the brand name Breztri Aerosphere in Japan, China and the US for patients with COPD.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency based its positive opinion on results from the ETHOS Phase III trial in which Trixeo Aerosphere showed a statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with dual-combination therapies Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) and PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate) over 52 weeks.1

The recommendation for approval was also supported by data from the KRONOS Phase III trial.2 In both trials, the safety and tolerability of Trixeo Aerosphere were consistent with the profiles of the dual comparators.1,2

Klaus Rabe, Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at the University of Kiel, Director of the Department of Pneumology at Clinic Grosshansdorf, Germany, Lead Investigator of the ETHOS trial and National Co-ordinating Investigator of the KRONOS Phase III trial, said: “Preventing exacerbations is central to the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as exacerbations may cause irreversible damage and disease progression. The triple-combination therapy, Trixeo Aerosphere, has demonstrated significant benefits in reducing moderate or severe exacerbations in patients suffering from this debilitating disease.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is now the third leading cause of death globally and affects approximately one in 10 adults over the age of 40 in Europe. Trixeo Aerosphere has demonstrated strong clinical benefit when compared with dual-combination therapies and this positive recommendation brings us closer to providing a much-needed new treatment to patients in Europe.”

COPD

COPD is a progressive disease which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness.3,4,5 It affects an estimated 384 million people6 and is the third leading cause of death globally.7 In Europe, approximately 10% of adults over the age of 40 have COPD.8 Improving lung function, reducing exacerbations and managing daily symptoms such as breathlessness are important treatment goals in the management of COPD.3 A single COPD exacerbation can have a negative impact on lung function,9,10 quality of life11 and increase the risk of hospitalisation.12 Additionally, even one COPD exacerbation that results in hospitalisation increases the risk of death.13,14

ATHENA clinical trial programme

The ETHOS and KRONOS Phase III trials are part of AstraZeneca’s ATHENA Phase III clinical trial programme for Trixeo Aerosphere, which included more than 15,500 patients globally across 11 trials.

ETHOS is a randomised, double-blinded, multi-centre, parallel-group, 52-week Phase III trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Trixeo Aerosphere in symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbation(s) in the previous year. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations.1 Results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.1

KRONOS is a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre Phase III trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Trixeo Aerosphere in patients with moderate to very severe COPD regardless of whether or not they had an exacerbation in the previous year. The primary endpoints were lung function parameters.2 Results were published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.2

AstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology

Respiratory & Immunology is one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company.

Building on a 50-year heritage, AstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care, across inhaled and biologic medicines. AstraZeneca aims to transform the treatment of asthma and COPD by eliminating preventable asthma attacks across all severities and removing COPD as a leading cause of death through earlier biology-led treatment. The Company’s early respiratory research is focused on emerging science involving immune mechanisms, lung damage and abnormal cell-repair processes in disease and neuronal dysfunction.

With common pathways and underlying disease drivers across respiratory and immunology, AstraZeneca is following the science from chronic lung diseases to immunology-driven disease areas. The Company’s growing presence in immunology is focused on five mid- to late-stage franchises with multi-disease potential in rheumatology (including systemic lupus erythematosus), dermatology, gastroenterology, and systemic eosinophilic-driven diseases. AstraZeneca’s ambition in immunology is to achieve disease control and ultimately clinical remission in targeted immune-driven diseases.

50599,Janssen's Tremfya (guselkumab) Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Approval to Treat Active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA),Janssen Receives CHMP Positive Opinion for Expanded Use of TREMFYA®▼ (guselkumab) in the Treatment of Active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) in the European Union (EU),"The CHMP’s positive opinion is based on P-III DISCOVER-1 & -2 studies assessing guselkumab (100 mg, q4w/q8w) vs PBO in 381 & 739 patients with active PsA & patients who were biologic-naïve only & who had an inadequate response to standard therapies respectively
 Combined results: @24wks. improvement in ACR (20%); improvements in quality of life scores SF36; higher PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 response rate were observed. In both studies, Tremfya was generally well tolerated through study completion
 Guselkumab is the first approved mAb that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. If approved, guselkumab will be the first selective (IL)-23 p19 subunit inhibitor licensed for both PsA and moderate to severe PsO","BEERSE, BELGIUM, October 16, 2020 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion recommending the expanded use of TREMFYA®▼(guselkumab) for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the European Union (EU). Guselkumab is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.1

Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. IL-23 is an important driver in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as PsA, psoriasis and others.2

“This positive opinion brings us closer to the addition of guselkumab to the drug armoury for the management of psoriatic arthritis, which is of critical importance for patients. Psoriatic arthritis is an impactful, multifaceted and currently incurable disease,” said Professor Iain McInnes,i Muirhead Professor of Medicine and Director of the Institute of Infection Immunity and Inflammation, University of Glasgow. “Long-term control of the diverse symptoms in joints, skin and soft tissue is required. If approved, guselkumab would be a welcome addition to our therapeutic options in the management of this disease.”

PsA is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory disease that is progressive and is characterised by debilitating joint damage and inflammation, in addition to enthesitis, dactylitis, axial disease, and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis.3 There is no known cure, and it is estimated that up to a third of the 14 million people who are living with psoriasis in Europe will also go on to develop PsA.4,5

The CHMP positive opinion is based on data from DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2, two first-in-class Phase 3 clinical studies, that demonstrated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab 100 mg q4w and q8w for the treatment of active PsA in adult patients. Data from these studies were recently published in The Lancet in March 2020.6,7

DISCOVER-1 evaluated 381 participants with active PsA who had an inadequate response to standard therapies, including participants (~30 percent) previously treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha biologics.6 DISCOVER-2 included 739 patients who were biologic-naïve only and had an inadequate response to standard therapies.7

Results published in The Lancet showed that in both studies, at week 24, the primary endpoints of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 percent improvement (ACR20) achieved statistical significance (DISCOVER-1: p<0.0001; DISCOVER-2: p<0.0001) in both q4w and q8w guselkumab groups (DISCOVER-1: n=255; DISCOVER-2: n=493) vs the placebo groups (DISCOVER-1: n=126; DISCOVER-2: n= 246). Significant improvements in quality of life scores (36-item short-form [SF36] physical component summary) were also observed in the guselkumab groups vs the placebo groups in DISCOVER-1 (p<0.0001 for both doses); in DISCOVER-2, significant improvements were observed in the q4w guselkumab group vs placebo group (p=0.0056 [q8w, p=0.068]). In addition, higher Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 percent improvement (PASI 75), PASI 90, and PASI 100 response rates were observed in the guselkumab groups vs the placebo groups (in DISCOVER-1, all unadjusted p<0.0001 with PASI 100 being p=0.0005 and in DISCOVER-2, all unadjusted p<0.0001).6,7

In both studies, guselkumab was generally well tolerated through study completion, and observed adverse events (AEs) were generally consistent with previous studies of guselkumab and the current Summary of Product Characteristics.1 In DISCOVER-1 and -2, serious adverse events up to week 24 in q4w treatment arms (0 and 3 percent) and q8w treatment arms (3 and 1 percent) were similar to those in the placebo arms (4 and 3 percent). In DISCOVER-2, less than 1 percent of patients experienced serious infections following guselkumab treatment, and no patient experienced serious infections following guselkumab treatment in DISCOVER-1. There were no reported deaths in guselkumab-treated patients and no guselkumab-treated patient developed inflammatory bowel disease, opportunistic infections such as tinea or candida, active tuberculosis or anaphylactic or serum sickness-like reactions.6,7

“We are excited to be one step closer to bringing guselkumab to both patients living with psoriatic arthritis, as well as to the doctors who treat them,” said David M. Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Immunology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Guselkumab reinforces our broad commitment to developing first-in-class treatments for patients living with psoriatic arthritis and other immune-mediated diseases.”

Guselkumab was first approved by the European Commission on 23 November 2017 for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.1 Guselkumab is approved in the EU, US, Brazil, Canada, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet [UV] light).1 It is approved in the US, Canada, Japan, Brazil and Ecuador for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA. A final decision from the European Commission (EC) regarding PsA indication expansion is expected later this year.

About DISCOVER-1 (NCT03162796)8

DISCOVER-1 was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in participants with active PsA, including those previously treated with biologic anti-TNF therapies. DISCOVER-1 evaluated 381 participants and continued through approximately 1 year.6

The study consisted of a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a blinded treatment phase of 52 weeks that included a placebo-controlled period from week 0 to week 24 and an active treatment period from week 24 to week 52. It also includes a safety follow-up phase of 8 weeks after week 52 (week 52 to 60; 12 weeks from the last administration of study agent [at week 48] through to the final visit in the safety follow-up phase). Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity and biomarker evaluations were performed in the study on a defined schedule.

About DISCOVER-2 (NCT03158285)9

DISCOVER-2 is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab administered by SC injection in participants with active PsA. DISCOVER-2 is evaluating 739 participants and continuing through approximately 2 years.7

The study consists of a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a blinded treatment phase (approximately 100 weeks) that includes a placebo-controlled period from week 0 to week 24 and an active treatment period from week 24 to week 100. It also includes a safety follow-up phase of 12 weeks after the last administration of study agent. Efficacy, health economics, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, biomarker and pharmacogenomics evaluations are being performed in the study on a defined schedule.

About Psoriatic Arthritis

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterised by peripheral joint inflammation, enthesitis (pain where the bone, tendon and ligament meet), dactylitis (severe inflammation of the finger and toe joints), axial disease, and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis.3,10,11 In addition, in patients with PsA, comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, anxiety and depression are often present.12 Studies showed that up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop PsA.4 The disease causes pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the joints; it commonly appears between the ages of 30–50, but can develop at any time.13 Though the exact cause of PsA is unknown, genes, the immune system and environmental factors are all believed to play a role in the onset and of the disease.13

About TREMFYA® (guselkumab)

Developed by Janssen, guselkumab is the first approved fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor.1 Guselkumab is approved in the EU, US, Canada, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet [UV] light).1 It is approved in the US, Canada, Japan, Brazil and Ecuador for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA. IL-23 is an important driver of the pathogenesis of inflammatory immune-mediated diseases such as psoriasis.2 In psoriasis guselkumab is administered as a 100 mg SC injection once every 8 weeks, after starter doses at weeks 0 and 4.1

50605,Sanofi's Sarclisa (isatuximab) Receives NICE Recommendation for Patients with Multiple Myeloma,"NICE recommends Sarclisa® (isatuximab) for patients with multiple myeloma, an incurable progressive blood cancer1","The NICE has issued FAD which is based on the P-III ICARIA-MM trial assessing isatuximab + pom-dex vs pom-dex in patients prior treated with 3L treatment and at least 2L therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor with RRMM in 307 patients with RRMM
 The study demonstrated that the combination regimen demonstrated a reduction in risk of disease progression or death in adults by 40%, mPFS (11.5 vs 6.5), well-tolerated with no increase in treatment discontinuation
 Isatuximab is a mAb that binds to a specific site on CD38 and is now available to eligible patients through the NHS Cancer Drugs Fund. Isatuximab is the first mAb approved in EU to be used in combination with pom-dex for RRMM","READING, UK – 15th OCTOBER 2020 – The National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) has issued a Final Appraisal Determination (FAD) recommending
Sarclisa® (isatuximab), in combination with existing treatment (pomalidomide and
dexamethasone, or pom-dex), for adults with relapsed/refractory* multiple myeloma
(RRMM) who have received three prior lines of treatment and at least two prior therapies
including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease
progression on the last treatment.
1
This recommendation has been welcomed by both the patient and medical communities
at a time when cancer patients, one of the most vulnerable groups, are facing a marked
impact due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, with delays in treatment and services.
“We’re delighted that NICE has recommended isatuximab. Myeloma remains
incurable and is a hugely challenging cancer to live with. It is vital for patients to
know that treatments are there waiting for them when they relapse,” said Laura
Kerby, CEO, Myeloma UK. “The limited therapies available for patients at later
stages of the disease mean that increasing options at this point in the treatment
pathway is crucial. Having access to a treatment that can provide valuable extra
months without disease progression offers hope that people will have more time
with their loved ones.”
Date of preparation: October 2020
Document number: MAT-GB-2002766 (v1.0)
An estimated 5,700 people in the UK are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year, the
equivalent to 15 people each day.
4 There are approximately 3,000 multiple myeloma
related deaths each year, with almost half of patients dying within five years of diagnosis.
4
Multiple myeloma patients experience frequent relapses and the cancer can become
resistant to available treatments, making it much harder to control.5
“Despite a growing understanding of multiple myeloma, it still remains incurable
and carries a significant disease burden among the older adult patient
population,” said Professor Kwee Yong, Consultant in Haematology, University
College Hospital, London. “Trials have shown that isatuximab, in combination with
pomalidomide and dexamethasone, offers a significant advantage over
treatments which were – until now – considered the standard of care for adults
with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Today’s recommendation,
therefore, provides us with an urgently needed new therapeutic option for this
group of hard-to-treat patients, for whom life expectancy and prognosis is poor.”
The ICARIA-MM trial demonstrated that isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and
dexamethasone showed a reduction in risk of disease progression or death in adults by
40%, potentially extending the length of time a patient can live without their cancer
progressing (progression-free survival) to 11.5 months, compared to 6.5 months when
treated with pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone (HR 0.596 95% CI 0.44-0.81
P=0.001).
2 Overall, isatuximab showed an additional 5.0 months without disease
progression.
2
Isatuximab was the first treatment in multiple myeloma to be awarded a Promising
Innovative Medicine designation and made available before approval via the Early Access
to Medicine Scheme (EAMS). The addition of isatuximab to pomalidomide and
dexamethasone was well tolerated with no increase in treatment discontinuation or
incidence of fatal events compared with that in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group.2 Sanofi is proud that through working with NICE, NHS England and the Cancer
Drugs Fund, eligible patients can now benefit from this treatment.
“At Sanofi Genzyme we are driven by all the loved ones taken by cancer, and all
those still facing it. We believe everyone affected by cancer deserve more – more
options, more support and more life,” said Nicole Farmer, General Manager, UK &
Ireland, Sanofi Genzyme. “We are therefore delighted at the recognition and
recommendation from NICE, meaning we are able to make a new treatment
option accessible to patients, offering a chance to delay disease progression.”
About ICARIA-MM
The NICE FAD is based on a cohort of patients from the pivotal ICARIA-MM trial who
received three prior lines of anti-myeloma treatment, including lenalidomide and a
proteasome inhibitor.2
ICARIA-MM is the first randomised Phase 3 trial to report results
evaluating an anti-CD38/pomalidomide/dexamethasone combination. It was an openlabel, multi-centre trial evaluating isatuximab in combination with pom-dex versus pomdex alone in patients with RRMM.2 The study enrolled 307 patients with RRMM across
102 hospitals spanning 24 countries, including sites in the UK.

About isatuximab
Isatuximab is a monoclonal antibody (also known as a mAb) that binds to a specific site
on a protein called CD38, a high amount of which is present on the surface of MM cells.
By binding to the CD38 protein, isatuximab helps the body’s immune system target and
destroy the cancerous cell.2
Isatuximab is the first monoclonal antibody therapy approved in Europe to be used in
combination with pom-dex for the treatment of RRMM. It was granted Marketing
Authorisation in the European Union on 30 May 2020.6

 Rinvoq is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. The submissions reinforce AbbVie’s commitment to bringing Rinvoq to more patients living with immune-mediated diseases","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., Oct. 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that it has submitted applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval for RINVOQ™ (upadacitinib) for the treatment of adults (15 mg and 30 mg, once daily) and adolescents (15 mg, once daily) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

The atopic dermatitis indication applications to the FDA and EMA are supported by data from three pivotal Phase 3 studies. RINVOQ was studied without topical corticosteroids (TCS) in Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 and with TCS in AD Up.1-3 In all three studies, RINVOQ demonstrated significant improvement in skin clearance and reduction in itch in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis compared to placebo.1-3 RINVOQ met the co-primary endpoints including at least a 75 percent improvement in the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI 75) from baseline and a validated Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 0/1 (clear or almost clear) at week 16.1-3 Additionally, more patients treated with either dose of upadacitinib experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch, defined as improvement in Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)≥4.1-3 The safety profile of RINVOQ was consistent across the three pivotal Phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis.1-3 No new safety risks of RINVOQ were observed in these studies compared to the safety profile observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis receiving RINVOQ.1-3,8-11

“While there have been advancements in care, patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis continue to experience relentless itch and skin symptoms that can impact their everyday lives,” said Michael Severino, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. “These submissions are an important step forward in our commitment to providing an additional treatment option for those who struggle with this debilitating and often underappreciated disease.”

Atopic dermatitis is characterized by a cycle of itching and scratching that leads to cracked, scaly, oozing skin, which intensifies with worsening disease severity.4,5,12 Between 20 to 46 percent of adults with atopic dermatitis have moderate to severe disease.13 The range of symptoms pose significant physical, psychological and economic burden on individuals impacted by the disease.4-6

About RINVOQ™ (upadacitinib)

In December 2019, RINVOQ was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The approved dose for RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis is 15 mg. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis are ongoing.14-22 Use of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis is not approved and its safety and efficacy have not been established by regulatory authorities.

Important Safety Information about RINVOQ™ (upadacitinib)23

RINVOQ U.S. Use and Important Safety Information
RINVOQ is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate did not work well or could not be tolerated. It is not known if RINVOQ is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.

What is the most important information I should know about RINVOQ?
RINVOQ is a medicine that can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. You should not start taking RINVOQ if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider (HCP) tells you it is okay.

Serious infections have happened in some people taking RINVOQ, including tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your HCP should test you for TB before starting RINVOQ and check you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with RINVOQ. You may be at higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster).
Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in people taking RINVOQ.
Blood clots in the veins of the legs or lungs and arteries are possible in some people taking RINVOQ. This may be life-threatening and cause death.
Tears in the stomach or intestines and changes in certain laboratory tests can happen. Your HCP should do blood tests before you start taking RINVOQ and while you take it. Your HCP may stop your RINVOQ treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
What should I tell my HCP BEFORE starting RINVOQ?
Tell your HCP if you:

Are being treated for an infection, have an infection that won’t go away or keeps coming back, or have symptoms of an infection such as:
Fever, sweating, or chills
Shortness of breath
Warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body
Muscle aches
Feeling tired
Blood in phlegm
Diarrhea or stomach pain
Cough
Weight loss
Burning when urinating or urinating more often than normal
Have TB or have been in close contact with someone with TB.
Have had any type of cancer, hepatitis B or C, shingles (herpes zoster), or blood clots in the veins of your legs or lungs, diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine), or ulcers in your stomach or intestines.
Have other medical conditions including liver problems, low blood cell counts, diabetes, chronic lung disease, HIV, or a weak immune system.
Live, have lived, or have traveled to parts of the country that increase your risk of getting certain kinds of fungal infections, such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest. If you are unsure if you’ve been to these areas, ask your HCP.
Have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People who take RINVOQ should not receive live vaccines.
Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Based on animal studies, RINVOQ may harm your unborn baby. Your HCP will check whether or not you are pregnant before you start RINVOQ. You should use effective birth control (contraception) to avoid becoming pregnant while taking RINVOQ and for at least 4 weeks after your last dose.
Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. RINVOQ may pass into your breast milk. You should not breastfeed while taking RINVOQ and for at least 6 days after your last dose.
Tell your HCP about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. RINVOQ and other medicines may affect each other, causing side effects.

Especially tell your HCP if you take:

Medicines for fungal or bacterial infections
Rifampicin or phenytoin
Medicines that affect your immune system
Ask your HCP or pharmacist if you are not sure if you are taking any of these medicines.

What should I tell my HCP AFTER starting RINVOQ?
Tell your HCP right away if you:

Have any symptoms of an infection. RINVOQ can make you more likely to get infections or make any infections you have worse.
Have any signs or symptoms of blood clots during treatment with RINVOQ, including:
Swelling
Pain or tenderness in the leg
Sudden unexplained chest pain
Shortness of breath
Have a fever or stomach-area pain that does not go away, and a change in your bowel habits.
What are the common side effects of RINVOQ?
These include: upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), nausea, cough, and fever. These are not all the possible side effects of RINVOQ.

RINVOQ is taken once a day with or without food. Do not split, break, crush, or chew the tablet. Take RINVOQ exactly as your HCP tells you to use it.

This is the most important information to know about RINVOQ. For more information, talk to your HCP.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

50727,AstraZeneca's Tagrisso (osimertinib) Receives the US FDA's Priority Review for the Adjuvant Treatment of Patients with Early-Stage EGFR-Mutated Lung Cancer,Tagrisso granted Priority Review in the US for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer,"AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso has received sNDA’s acceptance and has been granted PR in the US for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage (IB, II, and IIIA) EGFRm NSCLC after complete tumor resection with curative intent
 The sNDA is based on the P-III ADAURA trial assessing Tagrisso (80mg, qd, PO) vs PBO for 3yrs. or until disease recurrence in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumour resection & adjuvant CT as indicated. Unprecedented results showed reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death by 80% and improvement in DFS
 Tagrisso is an irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against CNS metastases with its expected PDUFA date in Q1’21","AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso (osimertinib) has received acceptance for its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) and has also been granted Priority Review in the US for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage (IB, II and IIIA) epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete tumour resection with curative intent.

While up to 30% of all patients with NSCLC may be diagnosed early enough to have potentially curative surgery, disease recurrence is still common in early-stage disease and nearly half of patients diagnosed in Stage IB, and over three quarters of patients diagnosed in Stage IIIA, experience recurrence within five years.1-4

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that offer significant improvements over available options by demonstrating safety or efficacy improvements, preventing serious conditions, or enhancing patient compliance. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for their regulatory decision, is during the first quarter of 2021.

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Patients with early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer are still at considerable risk of recurrence after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, and new targeted treatment options are critical to improving outcomes for these patients. This expedited review underscores the unprecedented disease-free survival benefit Tagrisso brings to patients in the adjuvant setting, and we will continue working with the FDA to provide this practice-changing treatment to patients as quickly as possible.”

The sNDA was based on results from the ADAURA Phase III trial showing Tagrisso demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in the primary analysis population of patients with Stage II and IIIA EGFRm NSCLC, and also in the overall trial population of patients with Stage IB-IIIA disease, a key secondary endpoint.

In April 2020, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended for the trial to be unblinded two years early, based on its determination of overwhelming efficacy. Investigators and patients continue to participate in the trial and remain blinded to treatment. The results from the ADAURA trial were presented during the plenary session of the American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program in May 2020 and were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Tagrisso received Breakthrough Therapy Designation in this setting in July 2020. Tagrisso is approved for both the 1st-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC and for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many other countries around the world.

Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.5 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.6 The majority of all NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease while approximately 25-30% present with resectable disease at diagnosis.1-3

For those with resectable tumours, the majority of patients eventually develop recurrence despite complete tumour resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.4 Early-stage lung cancer diagnoses are often only made when the cancer is found on imaging for an unrelated condition.7-8

Approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and Europe, and 30-40% of patients in Asia have EGFRm NSCLC.9-11 These patients are particularly sensitive to treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which block the cell-signalling pathways that drive the growth of tumour cells.12

ADAURA

ADAURA is a randomised, double-blinded, global, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with Stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumour resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated. Patients were treated with Tagrisso 80mg once-daily oral tablets or placebo for three years or until disease recurrence.

The trial enrolled in more than 200 centres across more than 20 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is DFS in Stage II and IIIA patients and a key secondary endpoint is DFS in Stage IB, II and IIIA patients. The data readout was originally anticipated in 2022. The trial will continue to assess overall survival.

Tagrisso

Tagrisso (osimertinib) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against central nervous system metastases. Tagrisso 40mg and 80mg once-daily oral tablets have received approval in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many countries around the world for 1st-line EGFRm advanced NSCLC and EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC.

AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action.

AstraZeneca aims to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFRm tumours as a genetic driver of disease with the approved medicines Iressa (gefitinib) and Tagrisso and its ongoing LAURA, NeoADAURA and FLAURA2 Phase III trials.

AstraZeneca is committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing SAVANNAH and ORCHARD Phase II trials, which test Tagrisso in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines.

50765,Lilly's Taltz (ixekizumab) Receives Health Canada Approval for Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis,Health Canada has approved TALTZ® (ixekizumab) for the treatment of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA),"The approval is based on P-lll COAST-X study assessing Taltz (80mg, q4w) vs PBO for the treatment of adult patients with nr-axSpA with objective signs of inflammation for 52wks.
 Result: 1EPs of ASAS40 @16wks. (35% vs 19%); ASAS40 response @52wks. (30% vs 13%), met its 2EPs, showing efficacy in reducing disease activity and sacroiliac joint inflammation, improving patient function & QoL, the safety profile is consistent with the previous study
 Taltz is a mAb that selectively binds with IL-17A cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor","TORONTO, Oct. 19, 2020 /CNW/ – On October 14, 2020, Health Canada approved TALTZ® for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation who have responded inadequately to, or are intolerant to conventional therapy.1 Another first-in-class milestone for the treatment, this approval makes TALTZ the first IL-17A inhibitor to be approved by Health Canada for nr-axSpA. This is the fourth indication for TALTZ, which was first approved by Health Canada for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in 2016, psoriatic arthritis in 2018, and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in 2020.

“People living with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis suffer through considerable pain and other symptoms of inflammation for as long as ten years before being accurately diagnosed. Limited treatment options exacerbate this challenge. Health Canada’s approval of TALTZ for this indication offers potential relief to many Canadians living with this debilitating condition,” says Dr. Doron Sagman, vice president, R&D and Medical Affairs, Eli Lilly Canada.

Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), which includes both AS and nr-axSpA, is a disease that predominantly affects the sacroiliac joints and the spine, which results in chronic inflammatory back pain and fatigue.2,3,4 For patients with AS, the disease is characterized by the presence of structural damage of the sacroiliac joints that appears on an X-ray, while patients with nr-axSpA do not have structural damage that is clearly detectable radiographically.6 These two patient subsets share a similar burden of disease and similar clinical features. However, approved biologic treatment options for patients with nr-axSpA are much more limited and patients are often underdiagnosed.4,5 Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis symptoms often first strike in late adolescence or early adulthood, often before the age of 40.7

This approval is based on the results from the Phase 3 COAST-X trial, which evaluated improvement in signs and symptoms of nr-axSpA as measured by the proportion of patients who achieved Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response criteria compared to placebo. The ASAS40 response measures the improvement in signs and symptoms of the disease, such as pain, inflammation and function.

“In the COAST-X study, 35% of patients treated with TALTZ met the ASAS40 primary endpoint at Week 16 compared to 19% treated with placebo. In addition, more than twice as many people achieved ASAS40 when treated with TALTZ vs. placebo by week 52,” says Dr. Proton Rahman, MD, FRCPC, Rheumatologist, St. John’s, NL and COAST-X trial investigator. “These figures reiterate that TALTZ could be an effective treatment option for adults living with axial spondyloarthritis.”

In COAST-X, the safety and efficacy of TALTZ was demonstrated in a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study of adult patients with active nr-axSpA with objective signs of inflammation. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients achieving ASAS40 at Week 16 (Canada, EU) and Week 52 (US). The proportion of TALTZ patients (n=96) achieving the primary endpoint of ASAS40 at Week 16 was superior to placebo (n=105), with 35% of patients treated with TALTZ 80 mg every four weeks achieving ASAS40 response compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo (p<0.05). A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with TALTZ achieved an ASAS40 response as early as Week 1 compared with placebo. The ASAS40 response at Week 52 was achieved by 30% of TALTZ patients, compared to 13% of placebo patients who achieved the same endpoint (p<0.01). The safety profile of TALTZ in patients with nr-axSpA was consistent with previous experience with TALTZ in other approved indications.

“We are pleased to learn that a new medication to treat non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis has been approved by Health Canada,” says Graeme Reed, Chair, Canadian Spondylitis Association. “Timely and equitable access to diverse and affordable treatment options are essential for patients living with this painful and debilitating condition.”

Other major secondary endpoints of the study included change from baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity (BASDAI), the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score, the proportion of patients achieving low disease activity (ASDAS <2.1), and change from baseline in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) score in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joints. The major secondary endpoints were met, with TALTZ showing efficacy in reducing disease activity and sacroiliac joint inflammation, and in improving patient function and quality of life.

About TALTZ®
TALTZ® (ixekizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with interleukin 17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. TALTZ inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

About the COAST-X Study
COAST-X was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TALTZ for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) in patients with objective signs of inflammation. Patients were required to have an established diagnosis of nr-axSpA and active disease defined by a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score ≥4 and a total back pain score ≥4 on a 0-10 scale at screening and baseline, and were required to have objective signs of inflammation by presence of sacroiliitis on MRI or presence of elevated CRP >5 mg/L.

About the TALTZ Program in axSpA
The COAST-X study is part of a clinical development program that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TALTZ across various population subsets of patients with axSpA. The COAST program includes three registration studies, each of one year in duration: COAST-V in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS)/radiographic axSpA who are biologic-naive; COAST-W in patients with AS/radiographic axSpA who previously had an inadequate response or were intolerant to 1 or 2 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors; and COAST-X in biologic-naive nr-axSpA patients with objective signs of inflammation. Patients could enroll into a long-term extension study (COAST-Y) after completing of any of these registration studies to receive TALTZ treatment for up to an additional two years.

 The study is designed to further assess the efficacy of prasinezumab by expanding upon the patient population enrolled in PASADENA study to include patients with early Parkinson’s disease on stable levodopa therapy and is expected to initiate in 2021
 Prasinezumab is the first anti-alpha synuclein Ab to advance into late-stage development. Additionally, Prothena will earn a $60M clinical milestones upon the first patient dosed in the study","DUBLIN, Ireland, Oct. 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Prothena Corporation plc (NASDAQ:PRTA), a late-stage clinical company with expertise in protein dysregulation and a diverse pipeline of investigational therapeutics for neurodegenerative and rare peripheral amyloid diseases, today announced that based on positive signals of efficacy consistent with disease modification in the PASADENA study, Roche and Prothena plan to advance prasinezumab into a Phase 2b study in patients with early Parkinson’s disease. The study will be designed to further assess the efficacy of prasinezumab by expanding upon the patient population enrolled in PASADENA to include patients with early Parkinson’s disease on stable levodopa therapy. Prasinezumab is the first anti-alpha synuclein antibody to advance into late-stage development. Prothena will earn a $60 million clinical milestone payment upon first patient dosed in this study. Further details are expected to be announced in the first half of 2021.

“We are very encouraged by the results from PASADENA, demonstrating significant slowing of motor progression and improvements on imaging biomarkers consistent with disease modification, as this provides a rich dataset to directly inform and de-risk this next late-stage study,” stated Gene Kinney, PhD, president and chief executive officer of Prothena. “Results from the PASADENA study are part of a growing clinical body of evidence suggesting antibodies that optimally target misfolded proteins can result in clinically meaningful benefit. With a growing pipeline of programs based on this scientific approach, Prothena is poised to advance a number of novel therapeutics for devastating diseases.”

About Parkinson’s Disease

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the entire nervous system that affects one in 100 people over age 60. An estimated seven to 10 million people are living with Parkinson’s disease worldwide. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease. The disease is characterized by the neuronal accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein in the CNS and peripheral nervous system that results in a wide spectrum of worsening progressive motor and non-motor symptoms. While diagnosis relies on motor symptoms classically associated with Parkinson’s disease, non-motor symptoms may present many years earlier. Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease are symptomatic and only address a subset of symptoms such as motor impairment, dementia, or psychosis. There are currently no treatments available that target the underlying cause of the disease and can slow its progression.

About Alpha-synuclein

Alpha-synuclein, a protein found in neurons and other cells, is a major component of pathology that characterizes several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, which collectively are termed synucleinopathies. The understanding of the normal physiological function of alpha-synuclein is limited, but evidence indicates that soluble forms of the protein may interact with other proteins and certain intracellular membranes. In synucleinopathies, the alpha-synuclein protein appears to be abnormally aggregated intracellularly, which contributes to disease pathology. There is increasing evidence that certain aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein can be transmitted from neuron to neuron, resulting in a propagation of pathology that causes neuronal dysfunction and loss. Recent studies in cellular and animal models of synucleinopathy suggest that the spread of alpha-synuclein-associated neuronal pathology can be disrupted by targeting aberrant forms of alpha-synuclein.

About Prasinezumab

Prasinezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets alpha-synuclein, a protein found in neurons that can aggregate and spread from cell to cell, resulting in the neuronal dysfunction and loss that causes Parkinson’s disease. Prasinezumab is designed to block the cell-to-cell transmission of the aggregated, pathogenic forms of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease, thereby slowing clinical decline. Prior to initiating clinical trials, the efficacy of prasinezumab was evaluated in various cellular and animal models of alpha-synuclein-related disease. In alpha-synuclein transgenic mice, the murine version of prasinezumab reduced the appearance of alpha-synuclein pathology, protected synapses and halted the worsening of behavioral phenotypes. In December 2013, Prothena and Roche entered into a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize antibodies that target alpha-synuclein, including prasinezumab. Prothena has an option to co-promote prasinezumab in the U.S., where the companies share all development and commercialization costs, as well as profits, on a 30/70 basis (30 percent Prothena, 70 percent Roche). Outside the U.S., Roche has sole responsibility for developing and commercializing prasinezumab and has agreed to pay Prothena up to double-digit royalties on net sales. To date, Prothena has earned $75 million of a total potential $600 million in milestone payments that includes clinical, regulatory and sales milestones. For more information on the Phase 2 PASADENA clinical study of prasinezumab in patients with early Parkinson’s disease, visit clinicaltrials.gov and search NCT #03100149.

50796,"Jazz Reports Results of Xywav (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) in P-III Study for Cataplexy or EDS in Patients with Narcolepsy","Jazz Pharmaceuticals Announces SLEEP Publication of Phase 3 Xywav™ (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) Oral Solution Study in Cataplexy or Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Patients with Narcolepsy","The P-III study involves assessing Xywav vs PBO in patients aged ≥ 7yrs. with cataplexy or EDS with narcolepsy
 Results: study met its 1EPs & 2EPs i.e. differences in median change in a weekly number of cataplexy attacks and ESS scores. Results were published at World Sleep 2019
 Xywav is an oxybate product with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92% less sodium or ~1,000- 1,500 mg/night less than sodium oxybate at the recommended dosage range of 6-9gms. The company expects to launch in Q4’20, following RESM implementation","DUBLIN, Oct. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) today announced the publication of the global Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter study of Xywav™ (calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium oxybates) oral solution, for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with narcolepsy. The results were published in SLEEP, the peer-reviewed, international journal of the Sleep Research Society.

In the trial, Xywav achieved the primary and key secondary endpoints demonstrating highly statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) in median change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores compared to placebo. Results of the study were previously presented in an oral presentation at World Sleep 2019.1

“This publication reinforces the option Xywav provides for those living with cataplexy or EDS associated with narcolepsy,” said Robert Iannone, M.D., M.S.C.E., executive vice president, research and development of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. “Xywav was approved in July by the FDA as a new treatment option indicated for both cataplexy and EDS in people living with narcolepsy and I am proud to be part of the organization that developed this groundbreaking therapy for people living with this debilitating neurological disorder.”

This Phase 3 study served as the basis of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of Xywav for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy.1,2 Xywav is an oxybate product with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92 percent less sodium – or approximately 1,000 to 1,500 mg/night less – than sodium oxybate at the recommended dosage range of 6 to 9 grams.2 Meaningfully lowering the level of sodium ingested by patients taking oxybate therapy may help patients align with American Heart Association recommended levels of daily sodium intake.3

The study enrolled 201 participants and randomized 134 participants, which included those previously treated with sodium oxybate and naïve to sodium oxybate, with or without other anticataplectic treatments. During the two week double-blind randomized withdrawal period, there was a significant increase in median weekly number of cataplexy attacks in participants randomized to take placebo compared with participants randomized to continue Xywav treatment (median [Q1, Q3]: 2.35 [0.00, 11.61] vs 0.00 [−0.49, 1.75], respectively; treatment difference, P<0.0001).1

At the end of the double-blind randomized-withdrawal period, there was a significant increase in median ESS scores in participants randomized to take placebo compared with participants randomized to continue Xywav (median [Q1, Q3]: 2.0 [0.0, 5.0] vs 0.0 [−1.0, 1.0], respectively; treatment difference, P<0.0001).1 The most common adverse reactions reported by participants (≥5%) were headache, nausea, dizziness, decreased appetite, parasomnia, diarrhea, hyperhidrosis, anxiety and vomiting.2

The company plans to launch Xywav in the fourth quarter of this year, following Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) implementation. Jazz is committed to ensuring access to our medicines and will work to secure the broadest access possible for appropriate patients.

About Xywav™ (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution
Xywav (JZP-258) oral solution, 0.5 g/mL total salts (equivalent to 0.413 g/mL of oxybate), is approved by the FDA for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. It is also being studied and developed for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in adult patients. Xywav is comprised of a unique composition of cations resulting in 92 percent less sodium, or approximately 1,000 to 1,500 mg/night less, than sodium oxybate at the recommended dosage range of 6 to 9 grams. Xywav has the same oxybate concentration as sodium oxybate and includes a mix of calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium cations. While the exact mechanism of action of Xywav is unknown, it is hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of Xywav on cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness are mediated through GABAB actions during sleep at noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as at thalamocortical neurons.2

Important Safety Information

WARNING: Taking XYWAV with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as medicines used to make you or your child fall asleep, including opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedating anti-epileptic medicines, general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, alcohol, or street drugs, may cause serious medical problems, including trouble breathing (respiratory depression), low blood pressure (hypotension), changes in alertness (drowsiness), fainting (syncope), and death.

The active ingredient of XYWAV is a form of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Abuse or misuse of illegal GHB alone or with other drugs that cause changes in alertness (or consciousness) has caused serious side effects. These effects include seizures, trouble breathing (respiratory depression), changes in alertness (drowsiness), coma, and death. Call your doctor right away if you or your child has any of these serious side effects.

Because of these risks, you have to go through the XYWAV and XYREM REMS Program to have your or your child’s prescription for XYWAV filled.

Do not take XYWAV if you take or your child takes other sleep medicines or sedatives (medicines that cause sleepiness), drinks alcohol, or has a rare problem called succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.

Keep XYWAV in a safe place to prevent abuse and misuse. Selling or giving away XYWAV may harm others, and is against the law. Tell your doctor if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs.

Anyone who takes XYWAV should not do anything that requires them to be fully awake or is dangerous, including driving a car, using heavy machinery, or flying an airplane, for at least 6 hours after taking XYWAV. Those activities should not be done until you know how XYWAV affects you or your child.

XYWAV can cause serious side effects, including the following:

Breathing problems, including slower breathing, trouble breathing, and/or short periods of not breathing while sleeping (sleep apnea). People who already have breathing or lung problems have a higher chance of having breathing problems when they use XYWAV.
Mental health problems, including confusion, seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), unusual or disturbing thoughts (abnormal thinking), feeling anxious or upset, depression, thoughts of killing yourself or trying to kill yourself, increased tiredness, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, or difficulty concentrating. Tell your doctor if you or your child have or had depression or have tried to harm yourself or themselves. Call your doctor right away if you have or your child has symptoms of mental health problems or a change in weight or appetite.
Sleepwalking. Sleepwalking can cause injuries. Call your doctor if you or your child starts sleepwalking. Your doctor should check you or your child.
The most common side effects of XYWAV in adults include headache, nausea, dizziness, decreased appetite, parasomnia (a sleep disorder that can include abnormal dreams, abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, sleep paralysis, sleep talking, sleep terror, sleep-related eating disorder, sleep walking, and other abnormal sleep-related events), diarrhea, excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), anxiety and vomiting.

The most common side effects of XYWAV in children include bedwetting, nausea, headache, vomiting, weight decrease, decreased appetite, and dizziness.

XYWAV can cause physical dependence and craving for the medicine when it is not taken as directed. These are not all the possible side effects of XYWAV.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

About Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by EDS and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.4,5,6 It affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in the United States, with symptoms typically appearing in childhood or adolescence.7,8,9 Studies have shown it may take 10 years or more for people with narcolepsy to receive a diagnosis.10,11 There are five main symptoms of narcolepsy, including EDS, cataplexy, disrupted nighttime sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.12 While all people with narcolepsy experience EDS, not all individuals with narcolepsy experience all five symptoms.5,11 EDS is the primary symptom of narcolepsy and is present in all people with the disorder.9,13 EDS is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in drowsiness and unplanned lapses into sleep.7,9,10 Narcolepsy is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.14,15,16,17

About Cataplexy
Cataplexy, the most specific symptom of narcolepsy, is the sudden, generally brief (<2 minutes) loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness. It is usually triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter, surprise, or anger.7,9 Although many emotions can potentially trigger cataplexy, those associated with mirth are usually the most potent.9 Cataplexy occurs in about 70 percent of people with narcolepsy.18 Presentation differs widely among people with narcolepsy, ranging from sporadic partial attacks triggered by laughter to frequent complete collapse brought about by a variety of emotions.7,9 Complete collapse is less common.7,9 More commonly, episodes of cataplexy involve only certain muscle groups, such as arms and legs (e.g., knees buckling), the head and neck (e.g., head dropping), or the face and jaw (e.g., sagging, slurred speech, eyelid drooping).7,9,18,19

50813,AWS and Onica Collaborate with Teva to Support its Digihaler Portfolio,"Teva, Amazon Web Services and Onica Announce Collaboration to Support Teva’s Digihaler® Portfolio","The three companies collaborated to build & host Teva’s Digital Health Platform which is a cloud-based backend data system, supporting the company’s FDA-approved Digihaler portfolio that consists of built-in sensors and Bluetooth wireless technology which connects to a mobile app that tracks inhaler events and measures inspiratory flow when a patient inhales
 Onica supported the serverless build of Teva’s platform and allow the system to deploy cloud capabilities of AWS. The digital health platform on AWS will allow for extreme scalability, resiliency, and cost-effectiveness
 The cloud system allows user to view stored information on their Digihaler events via the companion mobile app, which can be linked to multiple inhaler devices","TEL AVIV, Israel & PARSIPPANY, N.J. & SAN ANTONIO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Teva Respiratory, LLC, an affiliate of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) announced today that the company is collaborating with Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) and Onica, a Rackspace Technology company, to build and host its Digital Health Platform.

Teva’s Digital Health Platform is a cloud-based backend data system that currently supports the company’s FDA-approved Digihaler® portfolio, the first-ever family of breath-actuated digital inhalers that contain built-in sensors and Bluetooth® Wireless Technology, which connects to a companion mobile app that tracks inhaler events and measures inspiratory flow when a patient inhales.

Technology, like the Digihaler® family of inhalers, provides objective inhaler event data which may help foster patient and healthcare provider (HCP) dialogue and help inform treatment decisions. The Digihaler® device automatically detects, records and stores inhaler event data and measures inspiratory flow rates.

“Onica leads some of the most complex technology projects in the world,” said Tolga Tarhan, CTO, Rackspace Technology. “We are positioned at the intersection of healthcare and technology. Through our partnership with Teva, we stand to revolutionize the way patients access their data. Accessibility and security are at the forefront of our services and we are proud to be working on Teva’s Digital Health Platform.”

Onica’s development team supported the serverless build of Teva’s Digital Health Platform, allowing the system to fully leverage the best-in-breed cloud capabilities of AWS. Hosting Teva’s Digital Health Platform on AWS will allow for extreme scalability, resiliency and cost-effectiveness.

“We’re pleased to bring together AWS’s unmatched portfolio of services with Teva’s long-standing respiratory reputation and expertise to now provide objective inhaler use data which may help inform physicians in the care and treatment of patients,” said Shez Partovi, MD, Director of Worldwide Business Development for Healthcare, Life Sciences, and Genomics at AWS. “Teva’s approach to providing patients with access to and control of sharing their inhaler event data with their healthcare provider has the potential to impact and inform how patient care is delivered, and specifically, within the asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) disease states.”

With this cloud system in place, users will be able to view stored information on their Digihaler® events via the companion mobile app, which can be linked to multiple inhaler devices. Patients can review their data over time, receive event notifications, including if their inhalation technique may need improvement. If desired, this information can be shared with their healthcare providers to have more informed discussions about their condition and treatment.

“With our Digihaler® products now being commercially available to patients, ensuring data security is paramount,” said Sven Dethlefs, Executive Vice President, Global Marketing & Portfolio at Teva Pharmaceuticals. “With digital health and remote monitoring emerging as vital elements of patient care, we are excited to be working with AWS and Onica who are experienced in ensuring patients’ information is secure while easily accessible to them.”

The Digihaler® portfolio currently includes ProAir® Digihaler® (albuterol sulfate 117 mcg) Inhalation Powder, which is indicated for use in patients 4 years of age and older to treat or prevent bronchospasm in those who have reversible obstructive airway disease and to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm, in addition to AirDuo® Digihaler® (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol) Inhalation Powder and ArmonAir® Digihaler® (fluticasone propionate) Inhalation Powder, both indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.

APPROVED USES AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR AIRDUO® DIGIHALER® AND ARMONAIR® DIGIHALER®

APPROVED USES

AIRDUO® DIGIHALER® (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol) inhalation powder is a prescription medicine used to control symptoms of asthma and to prevent symptoms such as wheezing in people 12 years of age and older.
ARMONAIR® DIGIHALER® (fluticasone propionate) inhalation powder is a prescription medicine for the long-term treatment of asthma in patients 12 years and older.
AIRDUO DIGIHALER and ARMONAIR DIGIHALER are not used to relieve sudden breathing problems from asthma and won’t replace a rescue inhaler.
AIRDUO DIGIHALER and ARMONAIR DIGIHALER each contain a built-in electronic module that records and stores information about inhaler events. AIRDUO DIGIHALER and ARMONAIR DIGIHALER may be used with, and transmit information to, a mobile App. AIRDUO DIGIHALER and ARMONAIR DIGIHALER do not need to be connected to the app in order for you to take your medicine.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

AIRDUO DIGIHALER contains salmeterol. Long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) medicines such as salmeterol when used alone increase the risk of hospitalizations and death from asthma problems. AIRDUO DIGIHALER contains an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a LABA. When an ICS and a LABA are used together, there is not a significant increased risk in hospitalizations and death from asthma problems.
Do not use AIRDUO DIGIHALER or ARMONAIR DIGIHALER to treat sudden breathing problems from asthma. Always have a rescue inhaler with you to treat sudden symptoms.
Do not use AIRDUO DIGIHALER or ARMONAIR DIGIHALER if you have a severe allergy to milk proteins or if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the product. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure.

Reduced adrenal function. This can happen when you stop taking an oral corticosteroid (such as prednisone) and start taking a medicine containing an ICS (such as AIRDUO DIGIHALER or ARMONAIR DIGIHALER). During this transition period, when your body is under stress such as from fever, trauma (such as a car accident), infection, or surgery, adrenal insufficiency can get worse and may cause death. Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency include:
feeling tired
lack of energy
Weakness
nausea and vomiting
low blood pressure

50826,Novartis's Branaplam (LMI070) Receives the US FDA's Orphan Drug Designation for Huntington's Disease,Novartis receives US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Orphan Drug Designation for branaplam (LMI070) in Huntington’s disease (HD),"The US FDA has granted ODD for branaplam in HD. In preclinical trials, branaplam demonstrated a reduction in levels of the mutant huntingtin protein. Additionally, the therapy showed a reduction in huntingtin mRNA in SMA patients
 Novartis expects to initiate the P-IIb study for branaplam in HD patients in 2021
 Branaplam (qw, PO) is an RNA splicing modulator, currently under investigation for the treatment of SMA","Basel, October 21, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation for branaplam (LMI070) in Huntington’s disease (HD). An Orphan Drug Designation grants special status to a drug that treats a rare disease or condition, and provides companies certain benefits to encourage the continued development of medicines that bring novel solutions to patients with these severe diseases.

In preclinical models, branaplam has been shown to reduce levels of mutant huntingtin protein. In addition, during the investigation of branaplam in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), it was also observed to reduce huntingtin messenger RNA (mRNA) in SMA patients. A decrease of huntingtin mRNA is expected to result in reduction of huntingtin protein levels, the underlying cause of HD. Based on these findings, Novartis intends to start a development program for branaplam to determine if it has the potential to be a transformative treatment for people living with this devastating condition.

Current treatment options for HD are limited to symptomatic treatments and there are no approved disease modifying therapies that delay disease onset or slow progression of the disease.

Branaplam is currently under investigation for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a rare, progressive genetic disease, characterized by loss of motor neurons that are responsible for muscle function. Branaplam is dosed once weekly for the treatment of SMA, and the same dosing regimen may also be a possibility for HD.

Novartis plans to start the Phase IIb trial for branaplam in HD patients in 2021.

About branaplam
Branaplam (LMI070) is a once-weekly, orally administered, small molecule RNA splicing modulator that is currently under investigation for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a rare, progressive genetic disease, characterized by loss of motor neurons that are responsible for muscle function. Novartis has more than 5 years’ clinical experience with branaplam in our ongoing SMA development program.

About Huntington’s disease
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive disability and death. Everyone has the huntingtin (HTT) gene, but only those who have a mutated form of the gene will develop the disease.

HD is characterized by progressive worsening in motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. These symptoms usually appear between the ages of 30 to 50, and worsen over a 15-20-year period. Approximately 70,000 people across Europe and the US have been clinically diagnosed with HD.

Current treatment options for HD are limited to symptomatic treatments and there are no approved disease modifying therapies that delay disease onset or slow progression of the disease.

50834,ViiV Healthcare Present Results of Long-Acting Cabotegravir and Rilpivirine at IDWeeK 2020,"ViiV Healthcare announces analysis showing no antiretroviral therapy interruptions due to COVID-19 across its clinical development programme for investigational, long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine","The company reported the positive findings of a pooled analysis of six ongoing clinical studies which includes P-IIb/IIIb LATTE-2, ATLAS, ATLAS-2M, FLAIR, POLAR, and CUSTOMIZE studies evaluating long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine regimen in 1,744 patients with HIV-1 infection across 16 countries
 The positive findings showed 93% of participants maintained their injection visits amid the COVID-19 with no instances of virologic failure or development of resistance and showed good tolerability
 Long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in patients who are virologically stable and suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) and has received Health Canada’s approval in Mar’2020","London, 21 October 2020 – ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, today announced the positive findings of a pooled analysis of COVID-19-related impacts across the investigational long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine clinical development programme. In the midst of the global pandemic, the analysis found no antiretroviral therapy interruptions across the entirety of the ongoing clinical development programme for long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine. When missed visits occurred due to the pandemic, the analysis showed they were manageable and successfully mitigated primarily by switching patients onto short periods of daily oral therapy of cabotegravir and rilpivirine, with good tolerability and no virologic failure or emerging resistance. These findings were presented today at the 2020 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) IDWeekTM.

Kimberly Smith, M.D., MPH, Head of Research & Development at ViiV Healthcare, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has presented us with perhaps the greatest real-world test to implementing the innovative regimen of long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine, which if approved, could shift the HIV treatment paradigm away from daily pills to injections administered by a healthcare provider every month or every two months. It’s reassuring to know that even in the midst of a global pandemic that has led to restricted access to some clinics and providers, there were few injection visit interruptions and those that occurred were effectively managed by providing participants with oral treatment. These findings speak to how the regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine may be adapted to meet the needs of people living with HIV who have events in their lives that could cause them to miss an injection appointment.”

The pooled analysis examined 1,744 participants across 16 countries currently taking long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine as part of the regimen’s ongoing global clinical development programme of six studies, which includes the phase IIb/IIIb LATTE-2, ATLAS, ATLAS-2M, FLAIR, POLAR, and CUSTOMIZE clinical trials. While the majority of participants (93%, 1,615) maintained their routine dosing schedule from December 2019 through the analysis end point of September 15, 2020, 129 participants (7%) in the ongoing clinical trials had a planned injection visit that was impacted by COVID-19.

To date, there have been no suspected or confirmed virologic failures observed for any participants whose planned injection visit schedules were impacted by COVID-19. Treatment interruption was prevented among impacted participants primarily by switching participants onto daily oral therapy with cabotegravir and rilpivirine (94 participants, 73%) or the daily oral standard of care antiretroviral therapy (27 participants, 21%). Seven participants (5%) were able to reschedule their long-acting injection visit. Of the participants who experienced an impact to their visit, 54 (42%) were due to clinic closure or staffing constraints, 11 (9%) were due to self-quarantine, 18 (14%) were due to confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and 46 (36%) were attributed to other reasons, including COVID-19-related travel restrictions.

One hundred ten of the 121 participants (91%) who transitioned to temporary oral therapy because of a COVID-impacted injection visit have since restarted therapy with long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine. Of those participants who transitioned back to injectables, the median duration of oral therapy was 51 days. Participants identified as impacted by COVID-19 will continue to be followed and data collected from that group is expected to be presented at a future medical meeting.

The long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine was approved by Health Canada in March 2020 and is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration and other global regulatory authorities. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) recently issued a positive opinion recommending marketing authorisation for long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine in both injectable and tablet formulations. The CHMP positive opinion is one of the final steps before marketing authorisation is granted by the European Commission, which has the authority to approve medicines for use throughout the European Union.

About the long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine
The long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine is an investigational regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in patients who are virologically stable and suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL). The complete regimen combines the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) cabotegravir, developed by ViiV Healthcare, with rilpivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) developed by Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson.

INSTIs, like cabotegravir, inhibit HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection. Rilpivirine is an NNRTI that works by interfering with an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which in turn stops the virus from multiplying.

CABENUVA (cabotegravir and rilpivirine extended release injectable suspensions) is currently only approved in Canada.

Important Safety Information for CABENUVA

50840,Roche Collaborates with Atea Pharmaceuticals to Develop AT-527 for COVID-19,Roche announces collaboration with Atea Pharmaceuticals to develop a potential oral treatment for COVID-19 patients,"The companies will collaborate to develop, manufacture, and distribute AT-527 to combat COVID-19. If approved, Atea will be responsible for distributing the treatment option in the US, with the option to request Genentech’s support, and Roche will be responsible for distribution outside the US
 The therapy is currently being evaluated in P-II study for hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 with anticipated P-III initiation in Q1’21, that explores the potential use in patients outside of the hospital setting. Additionally, AT-527 may be developed for post-exposure prophylactic settings
 AT-527 is an investigational, oral, purine nucleotide prodrug that has demonstrated in antiviral activity against several enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, including human flavivirus and coronavirus","Basel, 22 October 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) and Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced today that they are joining forces in the fight against COVID-19 to develop, manufacture and distribute AT-527, Atea’s investigational oral direct-acting antiviral, to people around the globe. AT-527 acts by blocking the viral RNA polymerase enzyme needed for viral replication, and is currently being studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial for hospitalised patients with moderate COVID-19. A Phase 3 clinical trial, expected to start in Q1 2021, will explore the potential use in patients outside of the hospital setting. In addition, AT-527 may be developed for post-exposure prophylactic settings.

AT-527, while being a potential oral treatment option for hospitalised patients, also holds the potential to be the first oral treatment option for COVID-19 patients that are not hospitalised. Additionally, the manufacturing process of small-molecule DAAs allows the ability to produce large quantities of a much needed treatment. If successful, AT-527 could help treat patients early, reduce the progression of the infection, and contribute to decreasing the overall burden on health systems.

The collaboration aims to accelerate the clinical development and manufacturing of AT-527, to investigate its safety and efficacy, and to provide this potential treatment option to patients around the world as quickly as possible. If AT-527 proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted, Atea will be responsible for distributing this treatment option in the U.S, with the option to request Genentech’s support, and Roche will be responsible for distribution outside the United States.

“The ongoing complexities of COVID-19 require multiple lines of defence. By joining forces with Atea, we hope to offer an additional treatment option for hospitalised and non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients, and to ease the burden on hospitals during a global pandemic.” said Bill Anderson, Chief Executive Officer of Roche Pharmaceuticals. “In jointly developing and manufacturing AT-527 at scale, we seek to make this treatment option available to as many people around the world as we possibly can.”

“Roche shares our passion for delivering innovative new medicines to address great unmet medical needs. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for a novel, oral antiviral to treat this highly infectious and often deadly virus,” said Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Atea Pharmaceuticals. “AT-527 is expected to be ideally suited to combat COVID-19 as it inhibits viral replication by interfering with viral RNA polymerase, a key component in the replication machinery of RNA viruses. Importantly, the manufacturing process for our small molecule direct-acting antiviral allows us to produce AT-527 quickly and at scale.”

About AT-527
AT-527 is an investigational, oral, purine nucleotide prodrug, which has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against several enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses, including human flaviviruses and coronaviruses. This highly selective purine nucleotide prodrug was designed to uniquely inhibit viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme that is essential for the replication of RNA viruses. Antiviral activity and safety of AT-527 has been demonstrated in Phase 2 clinical studies of hepatitis C patients, and in preclinical in-vitro assays with SARS-CoV2 virus. AT-527 is not yet licensed or approved for any indication in the United States or any other country.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
As a leading healthcare company we are doing all we can to support countries in minimising the impact of COVID-19. We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help to detect and diagnose the infection in patients, as well as providing digital support to healthcare systems, and we continue to identify, develop and support potential therapies which can play a role in treating the disease.

We understand the impact of COVID-19 goes beyond those who contract it, which is why we are working with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need during these challenging times. As we learn from the pandemic, we are partnering with governments and others to make healthcare stronger and more sustainable in the future.

Our diagnostics solutions:
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. Our portfolio includes:

a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, (FDA Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) and available in countries accepting the CE Mark)
a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-based antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood targeting the nucleocapsid (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
an IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19 (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic
a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test to help determine at the point of care whether a person has been exposed to the virus (CE Mark)
a rapid antigen test to support in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care within 15 minutes (CE Mark)
a high-volume molecular test to simultaneously detect and differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B, as the symptoms are similar for both (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
a second SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, aimed at measuring the spike protein to support vaccination development and complement our existing portfolio
a point-of-care molecular PCR test that simultaneously detects and differentiates between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B infections to support urgent triage and diagnosis (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
Our research into therapies:
Roche is committed to improving the treatment of COVID-19. We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are exploring the potential of our investigational molecules.

In August, we announced a partnership with Regeneron to develop, manufacture, and increase global supply of their investigational antibody combination for COVID-19 if it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted.

At the beginning of the pandemic, on 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA – a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. On 29 July we announced that COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia or the key secondary endpoint of reduced mortality.

Separately, we have studied Actemra©/RoActemra© in the EMPACTA study in COVID-19 associated hospitalised pneumonia in patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials. On 18 September we announced that the phase III EMPACTA study showed Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care reduced the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. However, there was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra/RoActemra or placebo.

Actemra©/RoActemra© is also being studied in combination with the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the REMDACTA trial in partnership with Gilead, announced 28 May. Actemra©/RoActemra© is not approved by any health authority for use in COVID-19 pneumonia. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.

50847,GSK Presents Results of Maternal &amp; Older Adults RSV Vaccines at IDWeek 2020,GSK presents positive clinical data on maternal and older adults RSV candidate vaccines,"GSK reported that its RSV vaccines for maternal immunization (GSK3888550A) and older adults (GSK3844766A) were well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in P-I/II clinical studies. Both the candidate vaccines contain a recombinant RSVPreF3, that triggers the required immune response
 The GSK3844766A was first tested in 48 healthy adults (18-40yrs.) & then in 1005 healthy older adults (60-80yrs.) with different dosages of antigen & adjuvant. The interim data 1mos. post-immunization elicited a robust humoral and cellular immunity while the vaccine includes AS01 adjuvant system to boost the immune response
 GSK3888550A was tested with 3 different doses vs PBO in 502 healthy non-pregnant women over monthly visits (day 8, 31 & 91 post immunization). The study results demonstrated that vaccine rapidly boost pre-existing immunity at all dose levels & @day8 it showed a 4-fold increase in RSV-A and RSV-B neutralizing Abs titers. P-III studies of both the vaccines are expected to initiate in the coming months","GSK today announced that its Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) candidate vaccines for maternal immunisation (GSK3888550A) and older adults (GSK3844766A) were well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in Phase I/II clinical studies. The data were presented virtually at the ID Week Congress.

RSV is a leading cause of respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis (inflammation and congestion of the small airways or bronchioles of the lung) and pneumonia (an inflammatory condition of the lung small air sacs or alveoli) in infants and older adults. It is estimated to cause about 3 million hospitalisations of children under 5 year of age globally[1], and 177,000 hospitalisations of older people in the US alone[2].

Both candidate vaccines contain a recombinant subunit pre-fusion RSV antigen (RSVPreF3) which is believed to trigger the required immune response. The vaccine for older adults also includes GSK’s proprietary AS01 adjuvant system[3] to boost the immune response as this population tends to show weaker immune response to vaccination than younger adults.

The vaccine candidate for older adults was first tested in 48 healthy adults (18-40 years old) and then in 1,005 healthy older adults (60-80 years old) with different dosages of antigen and adjuvant compared with a placebo. The interim data 1-month post-immunisation show that:

the candidate vaccine elicited a robust humoral and cellular immunity compared with baseline
a close to 10 times increase of protective antibodies (RSVPreF3 IgG and RSV-A neutralising antibodies) was induced in the vaccinated group
importantly, the cellular immunity (RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T-cells) of the vaccinated older adults was boosted to reach similar range to that observed in the younger adults after vaccination with the non-adjuvanted formulation, despite the initial lower baseline level observed in older adults compared with young adults.
The maternal RSV candidate vaccine was tested with 3 different doses compared with placebo in 502 healthy non-pregnant women over monthly visits (Day 8, Day 31 and Day 91 post immunisation). The data show that, compared with baseline:

the investigational vaccine was able to rapidly boost the pre-existing immunity at all dose levels, leading to high levels of protective neutralising antibodies
at Day 8, a 14-fold increase in RSV-A and RSV-B neutralising antibodies titers was observed.
These two vaccines are part of a tailored, portfolio approach GSK is pursuing with three RSV candidate vaccines – maternal, paediatric and older adults – using different novel technologies aiming to help protect the populations most impacted: infants and older adults. All three candidate vaccines have received FDA fast-track designation.

Emmanuel Hanon, Senior Vice-President and Head of Vaccines R&D, said: “RSV is an infectious disease that can have a very serious impact on families and societies. We are delighted to see these positive results confirming our approach to develop dedicated vaccines building on the strategic use of our platform technologies for the populations most at risk from RSV infections – young infants and older adults. Our portfolio strategy takes into account the unique needs of the immune system of these vulnerable populations and we look forward to progressing these assets to Phase III trials to evaluate their potential efficacy”.

Vaccines for RSV prevention could lead to significant reductions in disease, doctor’s visits, and hospitalisations in infants, toddlers, and older adults, thus having the potential for a significant benefit to individual health in the most vulnerable populations as well as a positive impact on the burden and costs of healthcare systems around the world.

Based on available data and engagement with regulators, Phase III studies for both older adults and maternal RSV candidate vaccines are in preparation and on-track to start in the coming months, while the Phase I/II (in RSV-seronegative infants) and Phase II (in RSV-seropositive infants) studies with the paediatric RSV candidate vaccine are ongoing. Phase I/II safety and immunogenicity data on the paediatric RSV candidate vaccine in RSV-seropositive infants will be presented at European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID) on 26-29 October 2020.

About GSK’s RSV candidate vaccine for older adults (GSK3844766A)

The Phase I/II study investigates the safety, reactogenicity and immune response of GSK’s RSV candidate vaccine in older adults aged 60 to 80 (NCT03814590). This candidate vaccine contains GSK’s proprietary AS01 adjuvant, which is also used in GSK’s shingles vaccine. The safety, reactogenicity and immune responses (humoral and cellular-mediated) were first assessed in 48 healthy adults aged 18–40 years who were vaccinated with either 30, 60 or 120 μg dose level of RSVPreF3 non-adjuvanted vaccine or placebo. Following favourable safety outcomes, 1005 adults aged 60–80 years were randomised in a 2-step staggered manner to receive 1 of the 9 RSV vaccine formulations containing either 30, 60 or 120 μg dose level of RSVPreF3, non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted with AS01E or AS01B, or placebo.

Interim data presented at ID Week show that within one-month post-immunisation, the adjuvanted candidate vaccine has been well tolerated with no safety concerns identified. The most frequently reported adverse events were pain at injection site, fatigue and headache.

Moreover, data 1-month post-immunisation show that the candidate vaccine elicited a robust humoral and cellular immunity compared with baseline:

High levels of RSVPreF3 IgG antibodies (geometric mean antibody concentrations were 8.4–13.5 for the 18-40 year old vaccinees, and 7.2–12.8 fold-higher in the 60–80-year-old vaccinees) and RSV-A neutralising antibodies (geometric mean antibody titers were 7.5–13.7 in the 18–40 year old vaccinees, and 5.6–9.9 fold-higher in 60–80-year-old vaccinees) were induced in all vaccinated groups.
Before vaccination, deficiency of RSVPreF3-specific T-cells (hypothesised to help promote viral clearance) was observed in older adults compared to younger adults. After vaccination, a robust RSVPreF3 CD4+ T-cells response in older adults had been boosted to reach a similar range than the one observed in younger adults, with significantly higher immune response in the groups who received the adjuvanted formulation.
About GSK’s maternal RSV candidate vaccine (GSK3888550A)

The goal of this candidate vaccine is to prevent RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections in infants during the first months of life by transfer of maternal antibodies – an approach based on GSK’s strong expertise in maternal immunisation acquired through pertussis and flu vaccine programmes. The polyclonal nature of the humoral response boosted by this vaccine could potentially offer broad protection across a large number of RSV strains and addressing the potential issue of virus escape mutation. Maternal immunisation could help to protect infants too young to be immunised from RSV-associated infections in their first months of life – when they are the most vulnerable – without any medical intervention required thanks to the passive transmission of neutralising antibodies from the vaccinated mother to the unborn child in the last weeks of pregnancy.

In this Phase I/II study (NCT03674177), 502 healthy non-pregnant women received 1 dose of either 30, 60 or 120 μg of recombinant protein-based RSVPreF3 or placebo. The safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity was monitored for 6 months. The data 1-month post-immunisation show that all vaccine dose levels were well-tolerated, with no safety concerns identified: the most frequently reported solicited adverse events were minor and included pain at injection site and headache.

Moreover, the data show that the candidate vaccine elicited a rapid and persistent immune response in all RSVPreF3 groups. The immune response peaked at Day 8 with a 14-fold increase in neutralising RSV-A and RSV-B titers from baseline. The neutralising titers declined over time but a >6-fold increase was still maintained at Day 91. Anti-RSVPreF3 IgG antibodies were boosted substantially in all groups with geometric mean concentrations of anti-RSVPreF3 IgG antibody (≥ 12-fold at Day 8 and ≥ 6-fold until Day 91 vs baseline). The 60 and 120 μg dose levels of RSVPreF3 were more immunogenic than the 30 μg formulation.

Safety and immunogenicity data from the first time in pregnant women study will be presented in the first half of 2021. The data currently available provide the confidence to advance to late stage clinical work.

 About respiratory syncytial virus

Globally, there are an estimated 33 million cases of RSV annually in children less than 5 years of age, with about 3 million hospitalised and approximately 120,000 dying each year from complications associated with the infection. Nearly half of these pediatric hospitalisations and deaths occur in infants less than 6 months of age[4]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, virtually all children in the US get an RSV infection by the time they are 2 years old and one to two out of every 100 children younger than 6 months of age with RSV infection may need to be hospitalised[5].

It also represents a significant health threat for older adults, with an estimated 177,000 hospitalisations and 14,000 deaths associated with RSV infections occurring in the US alone[6]. Without robust surveillance systems in several countries, global data on the burden of RSV in older adults is either lacking or likely to underestimate its significance. As global population ages, morbidity and mortality of respiratory infections including RSV to be steadily increasing.

 Nedosiran is an investigational candidate in development for the treatment of all three known types of PH – PH1, PH2, and PH3, act by inhibiting the LDH enzyme","LEXINGTON, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Oct. 22, 2020– Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: DRNA) (the “Company” or “Dicerna”), a leading developer of investigational ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) therapeutics, today announced positive new interim data from its ongoing PHYOX™3 open-label trial of once-monthly nedosiran, an investigational candidate in development for the treatment of all three known types of primary hyperoxaluria (PH) – PH1, PH2 and PH3. PH is a family of ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorders that initially manifest with complications in the kidneys. These results were presented as part of the American Society of Nephrology’s Kidney Week 2020 annual scientific conference.

All 13 participants (10 with PH1 and three with PH2) receiving nedosiran, who had previously completed the PHYOX1 Phase 1 trial and had reached Day 180 in the ongoing PHYOX3 trial, achieved normal (12 of 13) or near-normal (one of 13) urinary oxalate (Uox) excretions at one or more timepoints. Of these, all 10 (100%) of the participants with PH1, and two of the three (67%) participants with PH2, achieved normal Uox excretions at one or more visits. In this study, normal Uox excretions were defined as below 0.46 mmol/1.73m2 body surface area (BSA)/24 hr, and near-normal Uox excretions were defined as ranging from 0.46 to < 0.6 mmol/1.73m2 BSA/24 hr.

“For patients with PH, excessive oxalate production compromises kidney function and can have life-threatening consequences,” said Shreeram Aradhye, M.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Dicerna. “We are encouraged by this latest interim analysis from our ongoing PHYOX3 trial showing that all PH1 and PH2 participants receiving nedosiran for six months reached the desired ranges of normal or near-normal urinary oxalate excretions. This is a promising outcome suggesting that nedosiran may meaningfully reduce hepatic oxalate overproduction, potentially slowing disease progression. We look forward to additional results from our ongoing PHYOX clinical development program, including our pivotal PHYOX2 trial, to support our planned New Drug Application submission next year.”

Key results from the interim analysis:

A total of 16 trial participants from the completed PHYOX1 trial entered the PHYOX3 trial. Of these, 13 who had reached 180 Days and had received six monthly doses in the PHYOX3 trial were included in this analysis. Three participants were not included in the efficacy analysis as they had not yet reached Day 180 at the time of the analysis.
All participants in this analysis, regardless of PH subtype, achieved normal or near-normal Uox excretion by Day 180.
92% of all participants (12 of 13) achieved normal Uox excretion at one or more visits through Day 180:
100% of participants (10 of 10) with PH1
67% of participants (2 of 3) with PH2
The single participant with PH2 who did not achieve normal Uox excretion during the analysis period reached near-normal Uox excretion rates.
The mean 24-hour Uox excretion for all 13 participants at Day 180 was in the normal range at 0.44 mmol/1.73 m2 BSA/24 hr.
62% of all participants (8 of 13) demonstrated normalized Uox excretions on at least three consecutive visits, meeting protocol-defined eligibility for gradual reduction in fluid intake requirements:
70% of participants (7 of 10) with PH1
33% of participants (1 of 3) with PH2
The mean maximum reduction in Uox excretion for all participants was 70.9% (range, 54.9% to 87.5%) by Day 180.
Nedosiran was generally well tolerated, and no serious safety concerns were identified in this ongoing study. There were no treatment discontinuations or study withdrawals during the observation period. Two participants had serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (pyelonephritis and nephrolithiasis) that were determined by the investigator to be unrelated to nedosiran treatment. The most common TEAEs were mild to moderate administration-site reactions. Protocol-defined injection-site reactions (ISRs) occurred in 18.8% of participants.
Also presented at ASN Kidney Week were the results of a retrospective claims analysis of commercial plan data (excluding Medicare and Medicaid lives) from IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus (1/2014-12/2019). The analysis included a 5:1 ratio of a random 5% sample of patients without PH or secondary hyperoxaluria (SH), matched to patients diagnosed with PH (subtype specificity not available). This analysis showed that the median cost of care for patients with PH (n=324) was approximately seven times higher than patients who did not have PH (n=1,620) (p<0.001).

“The observations from this claims analysis highlight some of the higher health care costs associated with having PH,” said Thomas Koenig, vice president, global market access at Dicerna. “This analysis suggests that, even excluding patients who are on Medicare and Medicaid who may have more advanced disease, patients with PH bear higher healthcare-related costs while still facing the potential for chronic kidney stones, declining kidney health, systemic oxalosis impacting other organs and the possibility of end-stage renal disease that may require dual liver-kidney transplantation. This analysis is the first known published insight into healthcare costs associated with PH and emphasizes the need for more research into the clinical and cost burden associated with this disease.”

Both posters were presented during the “Genetic Diseases of the Kidneys: Non-Cystic – 1” session at the Kidney Week conference and will be posted in the Events & Presentations section of Dicerna’s corporate website.

About the Nedosiran PHYOX™3 Trial

The PHYOX™3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04042402) is an ongoing, open-label extension study evaluating nedosiran’s long-term safety and efficacy in participants with primary hyperoxaluria (PH), a family of ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorders that initially manifest with recurrent renal stones and can lead to kidney failure. The PHYOX3 trial is open to participants six years of age or older with PH1 or PH2 who have participated in any previous PHYOX clinical development program trial, as well as their siblings with PH between the ages of six to 18. The study’s primary endpoint will evaluate annual rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function and nedosiran’s ability to preserve remaining kidney function. The PHYOX3 trial also will evaluate nedosiran’s long-term safety and effect on new stone formation, nephrocalcinosis, and the durability of reducing Uox levels, as well as its potential to enable the gradual decrease or elimination of their disease management practices.

About Primary Hyperoxaluria (PH)

Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a family of ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorders that initially manifest with complications in the kidneys. There are three known types of PH (PH1, PH2 and PH3), each resulting from a mutation in one of three different genes. These genetic mutations cause enzyme deficiencies that result in the overproduction of a substrate called oxalate. Abnormal production and accumulation of oxalate leads to recurrent kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis and chronic kidney disease that may progress to end-stage renal disease requiring intensive dialysis. Compromised renal function eventually results in the accumulation of oxalate in a wide range of organs including the skin, bones, eyes and heart. In the most severe cases, symptoms start in the first year of life. A combined liver-kidney transplant may be undertaken to resolve PH1 or PH2, but it is an invasive solution with limited availability and high morbidity that requires lifelong immune suppression to prevent organ rejection. There are currently no approved medications for the treatment of PH. Patients are limited to using hyperhydration and medication to attempt to increase solubility of oxalate in urine. Despite these interventions, oxalate may continue to accumulate in the kidneys and other organs, causing damage.

About Nedosiran

Nedosiran is the only RNAi drug candidate in development for primary hyperoxaluria (PH) types 1, 2 and 3 and is Dicerna’s most advanced product candidate utilizing the proprietary GalXC™ RNAi technology platform. Nedosiran is designed to inhibit the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme – an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in a common pathway resulting in oxalate overproduction in patients with PH1, PH2 and PH3. Dicerna is evaluating the safety and efficacy of nedosiran in patients with all known forms of PH as part of its PHYOX™ clinical development program.

The other two studies include two P-II OLE studies (SIMPLE-Severe trial & SIMPLE-Moderate trial)
 ACTT-1 trial results: improvement in time to recovery in overall study population & in patients who required oxygen (10 vs 15days & 11 vs 18days); reduction in disease progression in patients needing oxygen, reduction in new mechanical ventilation or ECMO (13% vs 23%)
 Additionally, FDA also issued a new EUA for the use of Veklury to treat hospitalized pediatric patients aged <12yrs. weighing at least 3.5 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to <40 kg with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 for whom use of an IV agent is clinically appropriate. Veklury is now the first and only approved COVID-19 treatment in the United States.","FOSTER CITY, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the antiviral drug Veklury® (remdesivir) for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. As an antiviral drug, Veklury works to stop replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Previously authorized by the FDA for emergency use to treat COVID-19, Veklury is now the first and only approved COVID-19 treatment in the United States. The drug is now widely available in hospitals across the country, following early investments to rapidly expand manufacturing capacity to increase supply.

In the United States, Veklury is indicated for adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Veklury should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care. Veklury is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to Veklury or any of its components; please see below for additional Important Safety Information for Veklury.

This approval is based on three randomized controlled trials including the recently published, final results of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID) double blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 ACTT-1 trial, which showed that treatment with Veklury resulted in clinically meaningful improvements across multiple outcome assessments compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Based on the strength of these data, Veklury has become a standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.

“The approval of Veklury marks an important milestone in efforts to help address the pandemic by offering an effective treatment that helps patients recover faster and, in turn, helps preserve scarce healthcare resources,” said Barry Zingman, MD, Professor of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, New York. “The availability of a rigorously tested treatment that can significantly speed recovery and offers other benefits such as lower rates of progression to mechanical ventilation, provides hospitalized patients and their families important hope and offers healthcare providers a critical tool as they care for patients in need.”

“Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gilead has worked relentlessly to help find solutions to this global health crisis. It is incredible to be in the position today, less than one year since the earliest case reports of the disease now known as COVID-19, of having an FDA-approved treatment in the U.S. that is available for all appropriate patients in need,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. “The speed and rigor with which Veklury has been developed and approved in the U.S. reflect the shared commitment of Gilead, government agencies and clinical trial investigators to advance well-tolerated, effective treatment options for the fight against COVID-19. We will continue to work at speed with the aim of enhancing patient outcomes with Veklury to ensure all patients with COVID-19 have the best chance at recovery.”

In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ACTT-1 trial, Veklury significantly improved time to recovery as compared to placebo – by five days in the overall study population (10 vs. 15 days; rate ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; p<0.001) and seven days in patients who required oxygen support at baseline (11 vs. 18 days; rate ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.52). As a secondary endpoint, Veklury also reduced disease progression in patients needing oxygen, resulting in a significantly lower incidence of new mechanical ventilation or ECMO (13% vs. 23%; 95% CI, -15 to -4). In the overall patient population, there was a trend toward reduced mortality with Veklury compared with placebo at Day 29 (11.4% vs. 15.2%, HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Additional mortality data from a post-hoc analysis were published in the New England Journal of Medicineon October 8, 2020.

The ACTT-1 trial results are complemented by results of two Phase 3 open-label trials of Veklury conducted in adult patients with severe and moderate COVID-19. The SIMPLE-Severe trial, conducted in hospitalized patients who required supplemental oxygen and who were not mechanically ventilated, found that a five-day or a 10-day treatment course of Veklury achieved similar clinical outcomes (odds ratio 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.12). The SIMPLE-Moderate trial, conducted in hospitalized patients who did not require supplemental oxygen, showed statistically improved clinical outcomes with a five-day treatment course of Veklury compared with standard of care (odds ratio 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.48; p=0.017). The odds of improvement in clinical status with the 10-day treatment course of Veklury versus standard of care were also favorable, trending toward but not reaching statistical significance (odds ratio 1.31; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.95).

The incidence of adverse events associated with Veklury was similar to placebo in the ACTT-1 trial. Rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) were numerically higher in the placebo group compared with the Veklury group. Treatment discontinuation, all-cause grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities were similar across groups. In the SIMPLE-Severe trial, the most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of subjects in either the Veklury 5-day or 10-day group, respectively, were nausea (5% vs 3%), AST increased (3% vs 6%), and ALT increased (2% vs 7%). In the SIMPLE-Moderate trial, the most common adverse reaction occurring in at least 5% of subjects in the Veklury groups was nausea (7% in the 5-day group, 4% in the 10-day group).

In parallel with the FDA approval of Veklury, the FDA also issued a new Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of Veklury to treat hospitalized pediatric patients under 12 years of age weighing at least 3.5 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to less than 40 kg with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 for whom use of an intravenous (IV) agent is clinically appropriate. This authorization is temporary and may be revoked, and does not take the place of the formal submission, review and approval process for the use of Veklury in this patient population. The use of Veklury in pediatric patients under 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg has not been approved by FDA, and the safety and efficacy of Veklury for this use has not been established. For information about the authorized use of Veklury in pediatric patients and mandatory requirements of the EUA in the U.S., please review the Fact Sheets and FDA Letter of Authorization available at www.gilead.com/remdesivir.

About the ACTT-1 Trial

The global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial ACTT-1 (NTC04280705) sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) evaluated the efficacy and safety of a 10-day treatment course of Veklury versus placebo in 1,063 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild, moderate or severe COVID-19 who also were receiving treatment with standard of care.

The primary outcome measure of ACTT-1 was time to recovery within 29 days after randomization. Recovery was defined as discharged from the hospital without limitations on activities, discharged from the hospital with limitations on activities and/or requiring home oxygen, or hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care.

About the SIMPLE Trials

Gilead’s two open-label Phase 3 trials of Veklury were conducted in countries with a high prevalence of COVID-19 infections and included U.S. trial sites that serve diverse communities.

The SIMPLE-Severe trial (NCT04292899) was a randomized, open-label multi-center study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of five-day and 10-day dosing durations of Veklury plus standard of care in 397 hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 was defined as patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, an SpO2 of ≤94% on room air, and radiological evidence of pneumonia. The primary endpoint was clinical status on Day 14 assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale. Treatment with Veklury was stopped in subjects who were discharged from the hospital prior to completion of their protocol-defined duration of treatment.

The SIMPLE-Moderate trial (NCT04292730) was a randomized, controlled, open-label multi-center study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of five-day and 10-day dosing durations of Veklury plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone in 600 hospitalized adult patients with moderate COVID-19. Moderate COVID-19 was defined as confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, SpO2 >94% and radiological evidence of pneumonia. The primary endpoint was clinical status on Day 11 assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale.

About Veklury

Veklury (remdesivir) is a nucleotide analog invented by Gilead, building on more than a decade of the company’s antiviral research. Veklury has broad-spectrum antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens, including Ebola, SARS, Marburg, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Veklury has been approved or authorized for temporary use as a COVID-19 treatment in approximately 50 countries worldwide. In our continuing commitment to develop effective treatments for COVID-19, multiple ongoing international Phase 3 clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of Veklury for the treatment of COVID-19, in different patient populations, formulations, and in combination with other therapies.

As announced on October 1, 2020, Gilead is now meeting real-time demand for Veklury in the United States and anticipates meeting global demand for Veklury in October, even in the event of potential future surges of COVID-19.

U.S. Important Safety Information for Veklury

Contraindication

VEKLURY is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions to VEKLURY or any of its components.
Warnings and precautions

Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions: Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, has been observed during and following administration of VEKLURY. Monitor patients under close medical supervision for hypersensitivity reactions during and following administration of VEKLURY. Symptoms may include hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, nausea, diaphoresis, and shivering. Slower infusion rates (maximum infusion time ≤120 minutes) can potentially prevent these reactions. If a severe infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue VEKLURY and initiate appropriate treatment (see Contraindications).
Increased risk of transaminase elevations: Transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers and in patients with COVID-19 who received VEKLURY; these elevations have also been reported as a clinical feature of COVID-19. Perform hepatic laboratory testing in all patients (see Dosage and administration). Consider discontinuing VEKLURY if ALT levels increase to >10x ULN. Discontinue VEKLURY if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation.
Risk of reduced antiviral activity when coadministered with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine: Coadministration of VEKLURY with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended due to antagonism observed in cell culture, which may lead to a decrease in antiviral activity of VEKLURY
Adverse reactions

The most common adverse reaction (≥5% all grades) was nausea.
The most common lab abnormalities (≥5% all grades) were increases in ALT and AST.
Drug interactions

Drug interaction trials of VEKLURY and other concomitant medications have not been conducted in humans.
Dosage and administration

Dosage: For adults and pediatric patients ≥12 years old and weighing ≥40 kg: 200 mg on Day 1, followed by once-daily maintenance doses of 100 mg from Day 2 administered only via intravenous infusion over 30 to 120 minutes.
Treatment duration: For patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): 5 days; may be extended up to 5 additional days (10 days total) if clinical improvement is not observed. For patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO: 10 days.
Testing prior to and during treatment: Perform eGFR, hepatic laboratory, and prothrombin time testing prior to initiating VEKLURY and during use as clinically appropriate.
Renal impairment: VEKLURY is not recommended in individuals with eGFR <30 mL/min.
Dose preparation and administration: See full Prescribing Information.
Pregnancy and lactation

Pregnancy: There are insufficient human data on the use of VEKLURY during pregnancy. Pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 are at risk for serious morbidity and mortality. VEKLURY should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.
Lactation: It is not known whether VEKLURY can pass into breast milk. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.
U.S. Indication for Veklury

VEKLURY is indicated for adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Veklury should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care.

50930,UCB's Vimpat (lacosamide) Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures,UCB’s anti-epileptic drug VIMPAT[®] (lacosamide) receives EU CHMP positive opinion for primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures,"The EMA’s CHMP has adopted a positive opinion on a license extension for Vimpat (lacosamide) and Lacosamide UCB (lacosamide) as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment for PGTCS in adults, adolescents, and children from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalized epilepsy
 The CHMP’s positive opinion is based on P-lll study assessing lacosamide as an adjunctive treatment for uncontrolled PGTCS. The therapy lowered the risk of developing a second PGTCS during a 24wks. period and demonstrated a higher rate of freedom from PGTCS during the treatment period
 The company expects the EC’s formal approval decision before the end of 2020, that broaden the clinical application of Vimpat and make a new treatment option available to aid the management of PGTCS","Brussels (Belgium), 22 October 2020, 07:00 (CEST): UCB today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion on a licence extension for its anti-epileptic drugs VIMPAT® (lacosamide) and Lacosamide UCB (lacosamide) as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.

The positive opinion is based, in part, on results from a phase 3 study of lacosamide as adjunctive treatment for uncontrolled primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS), recently published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry.6

In the study, UCB’s anti-epileptic Drug (AED) lowered the risk of developing a second primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure during a 24-week period and demonstrated a significantly higher rate of freedom from PGTCS during the treatment period compared with placebo. Lacosamide was generally tolerated by patients enrolled in the study.

Idiopathic generalized epilepsy, (IGEs) account for 20%–40% of all epilepsies2 and are characterized by different generalized seizure types (absence, myoclonic and PGTCS).3 Patients living with generalized tonic-clonic seizures have an increased risk of injury4 and those who experienced three or more in one year had a fifteen-fold increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.5

“People living with uncontrolled primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures face tremendous challenges and currently have few treatment options available to them. This form of epilepsy can be devastating, significantly impacting the quality of a patient’s life. Additionally, many patients are refractory, meaning they do not respond to currently approved medicines. This unpredictability can present numerous challenges and barriers”, explained Iris Loew-Friedrich, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, UCB. “We are very pleased the CHMP has recognised the impact of PGTCS, and the importance of broadening the number of adjunctive therapies available to people living with this type of epilepsy”.

The European Commission’s (EC) formal approval decision is expected before the end of 2020, which would further broaden the clinical application of VIMPAT® and make a new treatment option available to aid the management of PGTCS.

“UCB remains committed to strengthening our leadership in epilepsy and to investigating new approaches and innovative solutions to deliver improved outcomes and experiences to the global epilepsy community. This applies equally to our current expansive in-market epilepsy portfolio as well as to our exciting pipeline. We know that people living with PGTCS currently have limited treatment options. With today’s CHMP positive opinion we’re excited that we’re one step closer to having an approved medicine to support the European epilepsy community,” explained Charl van Zyl, Executive Vice President & Head of Neurology Solutions, UCB.

VIMPAT® is currently not approved for PGTCS in any country in the world. In addition to this CHMP positive opinion, regulatory reviews for use of VIMPAT as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy four years of age and older compared to placebo are underway in the U.S., Japan, and Australia.

About VIMPAT® in the EU 
VIMPAT® was first launched in the European Union in September 2008, as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adult and adolescent (16-18 years) patients with epilepsy.

In countries of the EU, VIMPAT® is available as film-coated tablets, syrup and solution for infusion. Lacosamide solution for infusion is an alternative for patients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible.

Important Safety Information about VIMPAT® in the EU and EEA9 
VIMPAT® is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. VIMPAT® therapy can be initiated with either oral or IV administration. For the paediatric population, the physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and dose. A single loading dose may be initiated in patients in situations when the physician determines that rapid attainment of lacosamide steady state plasma concentration and therapeutic effect is warranted. It should be administered under medical supervision with consideration of the potential for increased incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmia and CNS adverse reactions. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in acute conditions such as status epilepticus. Use of a loading dose is not recommended in adolescents and children weighing less than 50 kg. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in children. A maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for paediatric patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment weighing 50 kg or more and for adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment as well. Based on data in adults, in paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. Lacosamide should be administered to adult and paediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment only when the expected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. The dose may need to be adjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects in the patient. In adolescents and adults weighing 50 kg or more with mild to moderate hepatic impairment a loading dose of 200mg may be considered, but further dose titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with mild or moderate renal impairment a loading dose of 200 mg may be considered, but further dose titration (> 200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/min) or with end-stage renal disease, a maximum dose of 250 mg/day is recommended and the dose titration should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose is recommended. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients; known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Special warnings and precautions for use: Treatment with VIMPAT® has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls. Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine. Dose-related prolongations in PR interval with VIMPAT® have been observed in clinical studies. VIMPAT® should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as patients with known cardiac conduction problems or severe cardiac disease (e.g. myocardial ischaemia/infarction, heart failure, structural heart disease or cardiac sodium channelopathies) or patients treated with medicinal products affecting cardiac conduction, including antiarrhythmics and sodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products, as well as in elderly patients. In these patients it should be considered to perform an ECG before a Vimpat dose increase above 400mg/day and after Vimpat is titrated to steady-state. In the placebo-controlled trials of VIMPAT® in epilepsy patients, atrial fibrillation or flutter were not reported; however both have been reported in open-label epilepsy trials and in post-marketing experience. In post-marketing experience, AV block (including second degree or higher AV block) has been reported. In patients with proarrhythmic conditions, ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been reported. In rare cases, these events have led to asystole, cardiac arrest and death in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions. Patients should be made aware of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. slow, rapid or irregular pulse, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting). Patients should be counselled to seek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur. Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal products in several indications. Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. The safety and efficacy of lacosamide in paediatric patients with epilepsy syndromes in which focal and generalised seizures may coexist have not been determined. VIMPAT® syrup contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Vimpat Syrup contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. Sorbitol may cause gastrointestinal discomfort and mild laxative effect.The syrup contains aspartame (E951), a source of phenylalanine, which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Vimpat syrup contains propylene glycol (E1520). VIMPAT® syrup contains 1.42 mg sodium per ml, equivalent to 0.07 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. VIMPAT® solution for infusion contains 59.8 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 3% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: VIMPAT® may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. VIMPAT® treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision. Accordingly patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of VIMPAT® on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects: The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) are dizziness, headache, diplopia, and nausea. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time. Incidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness may be higher after a loading dose. Other common adverse reactions (≥1% – <10%) are depression, confusional state, insomnia, balance disorder, memory impairment, cognitive disorder, somnolence, tremor, nystagmus, hypoesthesia, dysarthria, disturbance in attention, paraesthesia, vision blurred, vertigo, tinnitus, vomiting, constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, dry mouth, diarrhoea, pruritus, rash, muscle spasms, gait disturbance, asthenia, fatigue, irritability, feeling drunk, injection site pain or discomfort (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration), irritation (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration), fall, and skin laceration, contusion. The use of VIMPAT® is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur. The safety profile of lacosamide in placebo-controlled and in open-label studies (n=408) in adjunctive therapy in children from 4 years of age was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults although the frequency of some adverse reactions (somnolence, vomiting and convulsion) was increased and additional adverse reactions (nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, pharyngitis, decreased appetite, lethargy and abnormal behaviour) have been reported in paediatric patients: nasopharyngitis (15.7 %), vomiting (14.7 %), somnolence (14.0 %), dizziness (13.5 %), pyrexia (13.0 %), convulsion (7.8 %), decreased appetite (5.9 %), pharyngitis (4.7 %), lethargy (2.7 %) and abnormal behaviour (1.7 %).
Laboratory abnormalities: Abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed in placebo-controlled trials with VIMPAT® in adult patients with partial-onset seizures who were taking 1-3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products. Elevations of ALT to ≥3xULN occurred in 0.7% (7/935) of VIMPAT® patients and 0% (0/356) of placebo patients. Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms, DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with some antiepileptic medicinal products. These reactions are variable in expression but typically present with fever and rash and can be associated with involvement of different organ systems. If multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, VIMPAT® should be discontinued.

Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.

 The focus of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose of DS-1055 for further study and is expected to enroll ~40 patients across the US and Japan. The company will integrate novel technologies with expertise in Ab biology to develop clinical candidates
 DS-1055 is a mAb designed to target GARP and to promote antitumor immunity through the depletion of GARP positive Tregs","Tokyo, Munich and Basking Ridge, NJ – (October 22, 2020) – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) announced today that the first patient has been dosed in a first-in-human global phase 1 study evaluating DS-1055, a GARP directed immuno-oncology therapy, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have progressed on standard treatments including checkpoint inhibitors.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly impacted the treatment paradigm for several cancers over the past decade with improved survival for subsets of patients, but the majority of patients do not respond to current therapies or eventually develop resistance.1 GARP is highly expressed on activated regulatory T cells (Tregs) and contributes to their immunosuppressive activity.2 Research suggests that targeting GARP on Tregs may be a promising new immune intervention strategy.2 There are no GARP directed therapies currently approved for cancer treatment.

“We are pleased to initiate clinical development to further evaluate the novel mechanism behind DS-1055, which was specifically designed to decrease the number of GARP expressing regulatory T cells and restore antitumor immune response,” said Arnaud Lesegretain, Vice President, Global Oncology Development, Alpha Portfolio, Daiichi Sankyo. “Evidence suggests that DS-1055 could serve as a new type of immune-based therapy for patients with various cancers, including those resistant or refractory to checkpoint inhibitors.”

About the Study
The first-in-human, global, multi-center, open-label phase 1 dose escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DS-1055 in adult patients with relapsed/refractory advanced or metastatic head and neck, gastric and esophageal cancers and other tumor types. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose of DS-1055 for further study.

The study will evaluate safety endpoints including dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events. Efficacy endpoints include objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, time to response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity and biomarker endpoints will also be assessed.

Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled in the U.S. and Japan. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04419532).

About DS-1055
DS-1055 is a monoclonal antibody designed to target GARP (Glycoprotein-A Repetitions Predominant), a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of activated Tregs in the tumor microenvironment. DS-1055 was designed to promote antitumor immunity through the depletion of GARP positive Tregs.

Tregs are involved in immune tolerance and have strong immunosuppressive activity.3 Tregs are accumulated in the tumor microenvironment, where they are activated and inhibit antitumor immunity through various mechanisms leading to suppression of effector T cells with antitumor activity.3 Tregs also cause resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors.1 High Treg presence in the tumor microenvironment is associated with poor prognosis in various types of cancer.4

Targeting GARP, which is selectively expressed on activated Tregs and contributes to the function of Tregs, may be a way to decrease the number of functional Tregs in the tumor microenvironment and restore antitumor immunity.2 Preclinical evidence has shown that depletion of Tregs results in antitumor activity.5

DS-1055 is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

The presentation highlights the PK/PD and exposure-response analyses
 Sanifit also presents the design of its ongoing P-III CALCIPHYX study evaluating the efficacy and safety of SNF472 for the treatment of patients with calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy, or CUA).

 SNF472 is an inhibitor of vascular calcification currently in P-III study, acts by targeting the deposition of solid calcium (hydroxyapatite, HAP) in the CV system. The company is showcasing new data on SNF472 in four presentations including one oral session and three ePoster sessions at virtual ASN Kidney Week 2020","Palma, Spain and San Diego, USA, October 22, 2020 – Sanifit, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for vascular calcification disorders, today announced the presentation of new data on lead candidate SNF472 today at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2020 Annual Meeting.

SNF472 is a first-in-class inhibitor of vascular calcification currently in Phase 3 clinical development. It is the only drug candidate in clinical trials which directly targets the deposition of solid calcium (hydroxyapatite, HAP) in the cardiovascular system, a major driver of morbidity and mortality in renal disease patients. At today’s virtual ASN conference Sanifit is showcasing new data on SNF472 in four presentations including one oral session and three ePoster sessions.

Today’s oral presentation by Dr. Glenn Chertow, Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Nephrology at Stanford University, provides additional insight from the Phase 2b CaLIPSO study (positive primary data published in Circulation in November 2019), and shows that SNF472 consistently slowed progression of coronary artery calcium (CAC) across key subgroups of patients on hemodialysis participating in the study. The benefit was observed in patients receiving contemporary treatment of end-stage kidney disease, including phosphate binders, calcimimetics, statins and other standard of care therapies. An ePoster also published today spotlights the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and exposure-response analyses from the CaLIPSO trial. Higher SNF472 exposure and ex-vivo inhibition of HAP crystallization (pharmacodynamic activity) correlated with a reduction in progression of coronary calcification in patients, and there was no drug accumulation.

Sanifit is also presenting the design of its ongoing Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study called CALCIPHYX in an ePoster. The study is evaluating efficacy and safety of SNF472 for the treatment of patients with calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy, or CUA), a highly morbid disease of vascular calcification and skin necrosis.

Additional data being presented today also demonstrates that SNF472 strongly inhibits valvular calcification in an in vitro model of porcine aortic valve.

“This is a robust set of data and we are pleased to be presenting at the ASN virtual meeting this year. In particular, we are delighted to share details of the innovative design of our Phase 3 CALCIPHYX trial, which includes alternate primary endpoints and is currently actively recruiting according to our plan,” said Joan Perelló, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sanifit. “These data demonstrate SNF472’s potential to help patients around the world suffering from consequences of vascular calcification. There are no currently approved treatments for calciphylaxis and we hope that SNF472 will provide benefit for these patients.”

The ASN conference is being held from 22-25 October and is fully virtual, with further information available on the ASN website. Links to abstracts and schedule details for presentations are below:

 The presentation expands on previously reported positive data showing vadadustat achieved clear and consistent results across 1EPs & 2EPs
 Vadadustat is an oral HIF-PH inhibitor designed to mimic the physiologic effect of altitude on oxygen availability and is also being evaluated in P-III PRO2TECT for anemia due to CKD in adult patients, not on dialysis. The company plans to submit NDA to the US FDA for anemia due to CKD in adult dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent patients in 2021","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKBA) today announced the presentation of clinical data from its global INNO2VATE Phase 3 program, which demonstrated the efficacy and cardiovascular safety of vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adult patients on dialysis, at American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2020 Reimagined (ASN Kidney Week). Vadadustat is Akebia’s investigational oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI) in development for the treatment of anemia due to CKD.

“The data presented today build on the positive top-line efficacy and safety results from INNO2VATE that were previously reported in May. More specifically, vadadustat’s cardiovascular safety profile in dialysis patients is further reinforced by newly presented data clearly showing vadadustat achieved non-inferiority to darbepoetin alfa on MACE, expanded MACE, cardiovascular MACE, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. These results were also consistent across multiple pre-specified populations,” said Kai-Uwe Eckardt, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Head of the Department of Nephrology and Medical Intensive Care Medicine at the Charité in Berlin and Co-Chair of the independent Executive Steering Committee for INNO2VATE. “Left untreated, anemia in dialysis patients results in high transfusion requirements and severely reduces a patient’s quality of life. The INNO2VATE results demonstrate that vadadustat could represent an attractive new oral treatment option for patients new to and already established on dialysis, upon approval.”

Results from INNO2VATE are being presented today at ASN Kidney Week during a presentation titled, “Global Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Vadadustat vs Darbepoetin Alfa for Treatment of Anemia in Patients with Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease” (Abstract TH-OR01).

Highlights of the INNO2VATE ASN Kidney Week Presentation:

Efficacy:

Global Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Vadadustat for Treatment of Anemia in Patients with Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease: Primary and Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint

Safety:

As previously reported, vadadustat achieved the primary safety endpoint of the INNO2VATE program, defined as non-inferiority of vadadustat versus darbepoetin alfa in time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), which is the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or non-fatal stroke across both INNO2VATE studies.
INNO2VATE results on key secondary safety endpoints were clear and consistent. Vadadustat demonstrated non-inferiority to darbepoetin alfa in analyses of expanded MACE, cardiovascular MACE, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality.
Global Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Vadadustat for Treatment of Anemia in Patients with Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease: Primary and Key Secondary Safety Endpoints

The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the incident dialysis patient (Correction/Conversion) study in vadadustat treated patients was 83.8% and 85.5% in darbepoetin alfa treated patients. During the study, the most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa treated patients were hypertension (16.2%/ 12.9%) and diarrhea (10.1%/ 9.7%). Serious treatment emergent adverse events were lower in vadadustat treated patients at 49.7% compared to 56.5% for darbepoetin alfa treated patients. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the prevalent dialysis patient (Conversion) study in the vadadustat treated patients was 88.3%, and 89.3% in darbepoetin alfa treated patients. During the study, the most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa treated patients were diarrhea (13.0%/ 10.1%), pneumonia (11.0%/ 9.7%), hypertension (10.6%/ 13.8%), and hyperkalemia (9.0%/ 10.8%). Serious treatment emergent adverse events were slightly lower for vadadustat treated patients at 55.0% and 58.3% for darbepoetin alfa-treated patients.
“We could not be more excited and pleased with such compelling results across our clinical development program in patients on dialysis for vadadustat,” said John P. Butler, President and CEO of Akebia Therapeutics. “The clear and consistent data set the stage for the potential approval of vadadustat and underscore its potential as a new oral standard of care for treating patients on dialysis with anemia due to CKD, including both incident and prevalent dialysis patients, upon approval. We look forward to bringing this innovative therapy to patients on dialysis globally, upon approval, and remain on track to submit an NDA as early as possible next year.”

Akebia’s vadadustat development program also includes PRO2TECT, the global Phase 3 program for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult patients not on dialysis. Results from this program will be presented at ASN Kidney Week in a late-breaking presentation on October 23, 2020. Akebia plans to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a New Drug Application (NDA) for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent patients as early as possible in 2021. In addition, Akebia and its collaborator, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., are working in close collaboration to prepare a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) next year.

About the INNO2VATE Global Phase 3 Program of Vadadustat
Akebia’s global INNO2VATE program included two separate Phase 3 studies for incident dialysis patients (Correction/Conversion) and prevalent dialysis patients (Conversion), which collectively enrolled 3,923 adult patients on dialysis with anemia due to CKD. The INNO2VATE incident dialysis patient study evaluated 369 incident dialysis patients and the prevalent dialysis study evaluated 3,554 prevalent dialysis patients. Both INNO2VATE studies were global, multicenter, open-label, sponsor-blind, active-controlled (darbepoetin alfa – an injectable erythropoiesis stimulating agent), non-inferiority studies. In both studies, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral vadadustat or injectable darbepoetin alfa. Efficacy and safety results were measured against non-inferiority margins agreed upon with the FDA and the EMA.

About Anemia due to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
Anemia is a condition in which a person lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body’s tissues. It commonly occurs in people with CKD because their kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that helps regulate production of red blood cells. Anemia due to CKD can have a profound impact on a person’s quality of life as it can cause fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction. Left untreated, anemia leads to deterioration in health and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in people with CKD. 

About Vadadustat
Vadadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitor designed to mimic the physiologic effect of altitude on oxygen availability. At higher altitudes, the body responds to lower oxygen availability with stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor, which can lead to increased red blood cell production and improved oxygen delivery to tissues. Vadadustat is in global Phase 3 development for the treatment of anemia due to CKD and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any regulatory authority with the exception of Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). In Japan, vadadustat is approved as a treatment for anemia due to CKD in both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent adult patients.

The FDA reviewed all safety data from studies globally and concluded it was safe to resume the trial
 A voluntary pause across all global studies was triggered on Sept 06, 2020, to allow the examination of safety data by independent monitoring committees. AstraZeneca has resumed the clinical trials across the globe with regulators in the US, UK, Brazil, South Africa, and Japan confirming that it was safe to do so
 While trials are ongoing, AstraZeneca and Oxford University will continue to provide information to regulators, study investigators, and participants according to clinical trial and regulatory standards","Clinical trials for the AstraZeneca Oxford coronavirus vaccine, AZD1222, have resumed across the world with regulators in the US, UK, Brazil, South Africa and Japan confirming that it was safe to do so.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today authorised the restart in the US, following the resumption of trials in other countries in recent weeks. The FDA reviewed all safety data from trials globally and concluded it was safe to resume the trial.

As part of the standard review process for trial safety events, a voluntary pause to vaccination across all global trials was triggered on 6 September to allow the examination of safety data by independent monitoring committees. The recommendations from these reviews have been supported by international regulators, who also confirmed that the trials were safe to resume.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “The restart of clinical trials across the world is great news as it allows us to continue our efforts to develop this vaccine to help defeat this terrible pandemic. We should be reassured by the care taken by independent regulators to protect the public and ensure the vaccine is safe before it is approved for use.”

It is not unusual that in large scale vaccine trials, some participants will become unwell, and every case has to be evaluated to ensure the careful assessment of safety.

Results from the late-stage trials are anticipated later this year, depending on the rate of infection within the communities where the clinical trials are being conducted. Data readouts will be submitted to regulators and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Rolling reviews of the vaccine programme have already begun in countries where this regulatory pathway has been established, providing regulators access to data as soon as they become available.

While trials are ongoing, AstraZeneca and Oxford University will continue to provide information to regulators, study investigators and participants according to clinical trial and regulatory standards.1-5

AZD1222
AZD1222 was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

 Eisai and Cogstate will work together for the development of digital tools for simpler self-checks of cognitive function and diagnostic tool development for HCPs to promote greater awareness of brain performance globally","MELBOURNE, Australia, Oct. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Cogstate, Ltd. (Headquarters: Melbourne, Australia and New Haven, USA, CEO: Brad O’Connor, “Cogstate”) announced today that the companies have entered into a collaboration whereby Eisai has secured the global development rights and exclusive commercialization rights of all cognitive function tests developed by Cogstate, including the “Cogstate Brief BatteryTM” (CBB) for use in healthcare and other markets. This global licensing deal is an expansion of an existing partnership executed in August 2019 whereby Eisai secured exclusive development and commercialization rights in Japan for all cognitive function tests developed by Cogstate, including the CBB. Both companies plan to proceed with development globally of CBB as a tool for individuals to self-assess brain performance to support healthy lifestyle choices and preventative measures in daily life, as well as a medical device to aid healthcare professionals in clinical diagnosis decisions.

Developed by Cogstate, the CBB is a scientifically validated digital tool that enables cognitive function self-checks and consists of four tests evaluating psychomotor function, attention, learning and memory, and working memory. In the United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the CBB has been adapted as a medical device named “CognigramTM” that has achieved marketing authorization by regulators in these jurisdictions and provides informative results for healthcare professionals to support clinical examination to aid in the diagnosis of MCI and dementia.

In its medium-term business plan, EWAY2025, Eisai is aiming to become a “Medico Societal Innovator” (a company that changes society through creating medicines and providing solutions). Eisai is creating next-generation medical remedies focused on the neurology and oncology areas as well as building disease ecosystem platforms, in order to provide environments and solutions including digital solutions for early diagnosis and early treatment.

Cogstate aims to make assessment of brain health as simple, common and informative as assessment of blood pressure. Cogstate’s technology, which is easy to use and available in over 70 languages, is supported by extensive scientific validation, including more than 600 peer reviewed publications. Cogstate technology has been used extensively in clinical trials, including trials conducted by Eisai.

The global agreement between Eisai and Cogstate will allow the two companies to replicate many of the advancements that have already been launched in Japan, where Eisai has developed and launched a new digital tool using the CBB, named “NouKNOWTM” (pronounced “NOH-NOH”), a non-medical device for self-assessment of brain performance (brain health). Eisai is currently investigating the possibility of developing a medical device using the CBB in Japan.

In recent years, various research has demonstrated the possibility that decline in brain performance may be mitigated through major readjustments to lifestyle, such as regular exercise and sleep, a well-balanced diet, and social interaction. However, according to a survey by Eisai, the number of people taking correct preventive actions or habitually performing self-checks of cognitive function are few, with disparities (“chasms”) existing against the incorporation of these habits into daily lifestyle.

As a result of these findings, in Japan, Eisai is constructing a dementia platform, called “Easiit”, with the goal of erasing these chasms. Core to this platform will be the brain-performance self-check tool “NouKNOW” and the “Easiit App” which aims to contribute to the promotion of health practices through data visualization of brain and body health insights.

It can be expected that the use of “NouKNOW” to perform periodic self-assessments of brain performance among the generation currently in their prime working years, along with the use of the “Easiit App” for the adjustment of lifestyle and practice of preventive measures in daily life, will become an opportunity for the creation of better brain and body health.

Through this agreement, Eisai and Cogstate will work together for the development of digital tools for simpler self-checks of cognitive function and diagnostic tool development for healthcare professionals to promote greater awareness of brain performance globally, thus contributing to the realization of well-being for all.

51025,Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly Report Results of Jardiance in Adults with HFrEF Regardless of Chronic Kidney Disease Status,New Jardiance® findings showed improved cardio-renal outcomes in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction regardless of chronic kidney disease status,"The companies present the findings from a new exploratory sub-analysis of the P-III EMPEROR-Reduced study demonstrating that Jardiance (empagliflozin) reduced the risk of adverse CV by 25% and kidney events by 50% in adults with HFrEF with/out diabetes regardless of CKD status at ASN Week 2020
 In all patient cohorts participating in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, the safety profile was like the well-established safety profile of Jardiance. In Mar’2020, the US FDA granted FT designation to the therapy for CKD based on its ongoing EMPA-KIDNEY study with its expected results in 2022
 In 2019, the US FDA granted FT designation to Jardiance for the reduction of the risk of CV death and hospitalization for heart failure in people with HF based on its EMPEROR program, which consists of two P-III studies EMPEROR-Reduced & EMPEROR-Preserved","RIDGEFIELD, Conn. and INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Findings from a new exploratory sub-analysis of the EMPEROR-Reduced phase III trial showed that Jardiance® (empagliflozin) reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular and kidney events in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction – with and without diabetes – regardless of chronic kidney disease status at baseline. These results were shared today as an oral presentation at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2020 and published in Circulation, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced.

“On their own, heart failure and chronic kidney disease are each associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations and premature death from cardiovascular causes. The presence of one condition often accelerates the onset and progression of the other, further increasing this risk and leading to poorer prognoses,” said Faiez Zannad, M.D., Ph.D., EMPEROR Program clinical investigator and Emeritus Professor of Therapeutics at the University of Lorraine, France. “In EMPEROR-Reduced, empagliflozin demonstrated a consistent reduction in the risk of the composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations, while slowing kidney function decline, in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, with and without chronic kidney disease. This is promising news for the growing population of adults suffering from both heart failure and chronic kidney disease.”

As previously reported, EMPEROR-Reduced showed Jardiance reduced the relative risk of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure by 25% and of first and recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure by 30%, and slowed the decline in eGFR, a measure of kidney function, in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with and without diabetes. An additional exploratory analysis showed that Jardiance decreased the relative risk of a composite kidney endpoint*, including end stage kidney disease and a profound loss of kidney function, by 50%. In this new analysis of all endpoints, these benefits were consistently observed in subgroups of patients with and without chronic kidney disease at baseline, including patients with severe renal impairment. In all patient cohorts participating in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, the safety profile was similar to the well-established safety profile of Jardiance.

“Over half of people with heart failure have moderate to severe chronic kidney disease, yet, there remains a need for new treatment options that address these interconnected conditions,” said Mohamed Eid, M.D., M.P.H, M.H.A, vice president, Clinical Development & Medical Affairs, Cardio-Metabolism & Respiratory Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “These findings continue to show the potential of Jardiance to help improve the lives of adults living with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, including heart failure and chronic kidney disease.”

“Heart failure and chronic kidney disease are common, life-threatening diseases that require improved treatment options. The EMPOWER clinical development program, including our ongoing EMPEROR-Preserved and EMPA-KIDNEY trials, explores the potential role Jardiance may play in improving outcomes for people with these conditions,” said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly. “The new findings from EMPEROR-Reduced will help us achieve our goal of redefining how people living with these conditions are treated.”

In March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation to Jardiance for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, demonstrating the urgent need for new treatment options for people living with the condition. This designation covers the ongoing EMPA-KIDNEY trial, which is investigating the effect of Jardiance on the progression of kidney disease and occurrence of cardiovascular death in adults with established chronic kidney disease, with and without diabetes. Results from EMPA-KIDNEY are expected in 2022.

The FDA also granted Fast Track designation in June 2019 to Jardiance for the reduction of the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in people with heart failure. This designation is for the EMPEROR program, which consists of the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials. EMPEROR-Preserved is exploring the effect of Jardiance on cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, an area that currently has no approved treatment options. EMPEROR-Preserved results are expected in 2021. Jardiance is not indicated for the treatment of heart failure.

The EMPEROR and EMPA-KIDNEY studies are part of the EMPOWER clinical program, the broadest and most comprehensive of any SGLT2 inhibitor, exploring the impact of Jardiance on the lives of people across the spectrum of cardio-renal-metabolic conditions.

*Composite exploratory endpoint included chronic dialysis or renal transplant or sustained reduction of ≥40% in eGFR (CKD-EPI) or a sustained eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (for patients with baseline eGFR ≥30) or sustained eGFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m2 (for patients with baseline eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2).

About the EMPEROR Heart Failure Studies
The EMPEROR (EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in patients with chrOnic heaRt failure) heart failure studies are two phase III, randomized, double-blind trials investigating once-daily Jardiance compared with placebo in adults with heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction*, both with and without diabetes, who are receiving current standard of care:

EMPEROR-Reduced [NCT03057977] investigated the safety and efficacy of Jardiance in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
Primary endpoint: time to first event of adjudicated cardiovascular death or adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure
Number of patients: 3,730
Completion: 2020
EMPEROR-Preserved [NCT03057951] investigates the safety and efficacy of Jardiance in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
Primary endpoint: time to first event of adjudicated cardiovascular death or adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure [Time Frame: up to 38 months]
Anticipated number of patients: approx. 5,990
Estimated completion: 2021
*Ejection fraction is a measurement of the percentage of blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction. When the heart relaxes, the ventricle refills with blood.

HFrEF occurs when the heart muscle does not contract effectively, and less blood is pumped out to the body compared with a normally functioning heart.
HFpEF occurs when the heart muscle contracts normally but the ventricle does not fill with enough blood, so less blood can enter the heart compared with a normally functioning heart.
About the EMPOWER Program
The Alliance has developed the EMPOWER program to explore the impact of Jardiance on major clinical cardiovascular and renal outcomes in a spectrum of cardio-renal-metabolic conditions. Cardio-renal-metabolic conditions are the leading cause of mortality worldwide and account for up to 20 million deaths annually. Through the EMPOWER program, Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly are working to advance knowledge of these interconnected systems and create care which offers integrated, multi-organ benefits. Comprised of nine clinical trials and two real-world evidence studies, EMPOWER reinforces the long-term commitment of the Alliance to improve outcomes for people living with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions. With 377,000 adults estimated to have enrolled worldwide upon completion of the studies, it is one of the broadest and most comprehensive clinical programs for an SGLT2 inhibitor to date.

The development program encompasses:

EMPEROR-Reduced, in adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization due to heart failure
EMPEROR-Preserved, in adults with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization due to heart failure
EMPULSE, in adults hospitalized for acute heart failure and stabilized to improve clinical and patient reported outcomes
EMPACT-MI, to evaluate all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with and without type 2 diabetes who have had an acute myocardial infarction, with the aim to prevent heart failure and improve outcomes
EMPA-KIDNEY, in adults with established chronic kidney disease to reduce the progression of kidney disease and the occurrence of cardiovascular death
EMPERIAL-Reduced, in adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to evaluate functional ability and patient reported outcomes
EMPERIAL-Preserved, in adults with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to evaluate functional ability and patient-reported outcomes
EMPA-REG OUTCOME®, in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death
EMPRISE, two non-interventional studies (U.S. and EU-Asia) of the effectiveness, safety, healthcare utilization and cost of care of empagliflozin in routine clinical practice in adults with type 2 diabetes across the cardiovascular risk continuum
About Cardio-Renal-Metabolic Conditions
Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly are driven to transform care for people with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, a group of interconnected disorders that affect more than one billion people worldwide and are a leading cause of death.

The cardiovascular, renal and metabolic systems are interconnected, and share many of the same risk factors and pathological pathways along the disease continuum. Dysfunction in one system may accelerate the onset of others, resulting in progression of interconnected diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and kidney disease, which in turn leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular death. Conversely, improving the health of one system can lead to positive effects throughout the others.

Through our research and treatments, our goal is to support people’s health, restoring the harmony between the interconnected cardio-renal-metabolic systems and reducing their risk of serious complications. As part of our commitment to those whose health is jeopardized by cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, we will continue embracing a multidisciplinary approach towards care and focusing our resources on filling treatment gaps.

What is JARDIANCE? (www.jardiance.com)
JARDIANCE is a prescription medicine used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes.

JARDIANCE is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes who have known cardiovascular disease.

JARDIANCE is not for people with type 1 diabetes or for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine).

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Do not take JARDIANCE if you are allergic to empagliflozin or any of the ingredients in JARDIANCE.

Do not take JARDIANCE if you have severe kidney problems or are on dialysis.

JARDIANCE can cause serious side effects, including:

Dehydration. JARDIANCE can cause some people to have dehydration (the loss of body water and salt). Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, light-headed, or weak, especially when you stand up.


You may be at a higher risk of dehydration if you:
have low blood pressure
take medicines to lower your blood pressure, including water pills (diuretics)
are on a low salt diet
have kidney problems
are 65 years of age or older.
Vaginal yeast infection. Women who take JARDIANCE may get vaginal yeast infections. Talk to your doctor if you experience vaginal odor, white or yellowish vaginal discharge (discharge may be lumpy or look like cottage cheese), and/or vaginal itching.
Yeast infection of the penis. Men who take JARDIANCE may get a yeast infection of the skin around the penis, especially uncircumcised males and those with chronic infections. Talk to your doctor if you experience redness, itching or swelling of the penis, rash of the penis, foul smelling discharge from the penis, and/or pain in the skin around penis.
Ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine). Ketoacidosis is a serious condition and may need to be treated in the hospital. Ketoacidosis may lead to death. Ketoacidosis occurs in people with type 1 diabetes and can also occur in people with type 2 diabetes taking JARDIANCE, even if blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL. Ketoacidosis has also happened in people with diabetes who were sick or who had surgery during treatment with JARDIANCE. Stop taking JARDIANCE and call your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms, and if possible, check for ketones in your urine:
nausea
vomiting
stomach-area (abdominal) pain

51033,AstraZeneca Presents Results of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) in P-lll DAPA-CKD Study for Chronic Kidney Disease at ASN Kidney Week 2020,"Farxiga DAPA-CKD Phase III trial reduced worsening of kidney function, risk of cardiovascular or renal death in patients with chronic kidney disease, irrespective of underlying cause","The P-lll DAPA-CKD study involves the assessing of Farxiga (qd, 10 mg) + SOC vs PBO in 4304 patients with CKD stages 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with/ out T2D
 Results of subgroup analysis : RRR & ARR (5.8% & 37%) for patients whose CKD was primarily driven by diabetic kidney disease; (25% & 2.2%) for high B.P.; (57% & 7.5%) for glomerulonephritis; (42% & 5.0%) for CKD of other or unknown causes (ARR = 5.0%) respectively. Also showed reduction in in all-cause mortality as secondary outcome
 Farxiga (PO, qd) is a first-in-class SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy & combination regimen as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control and has received FDA’s BTD & CHMP’s recommendation in Oct’2020","A new subgroup analysis from the ground-breaking DAPA-CKD Phase III trial showed that AstraZeneca’s Farxiga (dapagliflozin), on top of standard of care, reduced the composite of worsening of kidney function or risk of cardiovascular (CV) or renal death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), irrespective of the underlying cause of the disease.1

CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function.2 It is estimated to affect nearly 700 million people worldwide, many of them still undiagnosed.3-5 One in three adults in the US, or approximately 80 million people, are at risk of developing CKD.5 The main causes of CKD are diabetes (38%), high blood pressure (26%) and glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation, 16%).6

In the subgroup analysis, compared to placebo Farxiga showed a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 37% for patients whose CKD was primarily driven by diabetic kidney disease (absolute risk reduction [ARR] = 5.8%); 25% for high blood pressure (ARR = 2.2%); 57% for glomerulonephritis (ARR = 7.5%); and 42% for CKD of other or unknown causes (ARR = 5.0%) (p−interaction for RRR 0.53).1 Similarly, Farxiga showed a reduction in all-cause mortality, a secondary outcome, compared to placebo regardless of underlying CKD cause (p-interaction 0.55).1

The safety and tolerability of Farxiga was consistent with the well-established safety profile of the medicine.

Prof. Hiddo L. Heerspink, co-chair of the DAPA-CKD trial and its Executive Committee, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands, said: “These results reinforce the potential of Farxiga to change the standard of care for a wide range of patients with chronic kidney disease, regardless of the root cause of the disease. This could open up enormous possibilities for the millions of patients living with chronic kidney disease worldwide.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “The DAPA-CKD trial showed the potential of Farxiga as the first SGLT2 inhibitor to significantly prolong survival in a renal outcomes trial in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type-2 diabetes. The new data presented further demonstrate Farxiga’s consistent and clinically meaningful benefit across a diverse group of patients with chronic kidney disease, a population in urgent need of new treatment options to slow the progression of their disease.”

The data were presented at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week Reimagined 2020.

Earlier this month, Farxiga was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the US for patients with CKD, with and without type-2 diabetes (T2D) and was recommended for approval in the EU by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for heart failure (HF). Additionally, in May 2020, Farxiga was approved in the US to reduce the risk of CV death and hospitalisation for heart failure (hHF) in adults with HF (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with and without T2D.

Chronic kidney disease

CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function (shown by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] or markers of kidney damage, or both, for at least three months).2 In its most severe form, known as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), kidney damage and deterioration of kidney function have progressed to the stage where dialysis or kidney transplantation are required.7 The majority of patients with CKD will die from CV causes before reaching ESKD.8

DAPA-CKD

DAPA-CKD is an international, multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded trial in 4,304 patients designed to evaluate the efficacy of Farxiga 10mg, compared with placebo, in patients with CKD Stages 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D. Farxiga was given once daily in addition to standard of care. Detailed results shared in August 2020 and published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed Farxiga reduced the primary composite endpoint of worsening of renal function (defined as a composite of a sustained ≥50% eGFR decline, onset of ESKD and death from CV or renal cause) or renal or CV death by 39% compared to placebo (p<0.0001). The results were consistent in patients both with and without T2D. Farxiga also met all secondary endpoints including the time to first occurrence of the renal composite (sustained ≥50% eGFR decline, ESKD and renal death), the composite of CV death or hHF, and death from any cause by 31% (ARR = 2.1%, p=0.0035).9

Farxiga

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction. In the DECLARE-TIMI 58 CV outcomes trial in adults with T2D, Farxiga reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of hHF or CV death versus placebo, when added to standard of care.

Farxiga is currently being assessed in patients with HF in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) trials, as well as in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking registry-based randomised controlled trial. Farxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

51040,Foundation Medicine's FoundationOne CDx Receives the US FDA's Approval as a CDx for Vitrakvi (larotrectinib),FoundationOne®CDx Receives FDA-Approval as a Companion Diagnostic for VITRAKVI®(larotrectinib) to Identify Patients with NTRK Fusions Across All Solid Tumors,"The US FDA approved FoundationOneCDx to be used as a CDx for Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) to identify patients with NTRK fusions across all solid tumors. The genomic test is currently approved as a CDx for 20+ therapies
 The FoundationOne CDx is the tissue-based CGP test approved to detect NTRK1/2/3 fusions across all solid tumor types and identify patients who may be appropriate for treatment with Vitrakvi
 The approval of Vitrakvi was based on three studies including LOXO-TRK-14001, SCOUT, and NAVIGATE studies and is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors that have NTRK gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation, are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and have no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have progressed following treatment","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Foundation Medicine, Inc. today announced that it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for FoundationOne®CDx to be used as a companion diagnostic for VITRAKVI® (larotrectinib), which is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors that have a neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation, are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and have no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have progressed following treatment. FoundationOne CDx, the only FDA-approved tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) test, is now approved to detect NTRK1/2/3 fusions across all solid tumor types and identify patients who may be appropriate for treatment with VITRAKVI.

NTRK fusion positive cancer occurs when a piece of the chromosome containing the NTRK gene breaks off and binds to another chromosome. These NTRK gene fusions produce TRK fusion proteins, which may cause cancer cells to grow.1 NTRK fusions are more commonly found in rare cancer types, such as secretory carcinoma of the breast or salivary gland and infantile fibrosarcoma, but they can also occur across many more common cancer types including glioma, melanoma and carcinomas of the lung, thyroid and colon.2

“Taking a comprehensive and validated approach to genomic testing is critical for all advanced cancer patients, but especially for those harboring rare mutations that can be missed with alternative testing methods,” said Brian Alexander, M.D., M.P.H., chief medical officer at Foundation Medicine. “Not only will this approval improve access to genomic testing and reinforce the role it plays in rare cancers, but it also confirms the incredible progress made toward tumor-agnostic cancer care. We’re proud of the impact this will have on NTRK fusion positive cancer patients.”

FoundationOne CDx is the first FDA-approved broad companion diagnostic that is clinically and analytically validated for solid tumors. The tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling test is currently approved as a companion diagnostic for more than 20 targeted therapies.

“Many patients with rare conditions, like NTRK fusion positive cancer have limited treatment options and poor access to targeted therapies,” said Susan Spinosa, co-chair and patient founder of the NTRKers. “This companion diagnostic approval is a critical step forward in addressing this challenge as it provides this patient population with broader access to comprehensive genomic testing and appropriate treatment options.”

The approval of VITRAKVI was based on data from three multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trials: LOXO-TRK-14001 (NCT02122913), SCOUT (NCT02637687), and NAVIGATE (NCT02576431). Identification of positive NTRK gene fusion status was prospectively determined in local laboratories using next generation sequencing (NGS) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). NTRK gene fusions were inferred in three pediatric patients with infantile fibrosarcoma who had a documented ETV6 translocation by FISH. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and response duration, as determined by a blinded independent review committee according to RECIST 1.1. The clinical validation to support the FoundationOne CDx NTRK companion diagnostic approval was then achieved through a clinical bridging study between the local clinical trial assays and FoundationOne CDx.

51072,"Samsung Bioepis Reports Results of Renflexis (biosimilar, infliximab) from Two Studies in IBD Patients",Samsung Bioepis Announces First Real-World Data on RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) with IBD patients from Veterans Affairs Healthcare System at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2020,"The company reported results from two real-world studies of Renflexis (infliximab-abda) in patients with IBD registered in the US Veteran Affairs Healthcare System database. Data were presented at ACG 2020
 One study assesses the safety of switching from reference infliximab or infliximab-dyyb to Renflexis in patients with IBD identified from the VAHS database and demonstrated an 83% continuation rate over 1yr. with similar continuation rate in patients who underwent a single & double switch from reference infliximab
 Second study focused on the real-world utilization pattern of infliximab products for IBD, within the context of VANF policy. The study found that Renflexis became the preferred infliximab product on VANF in Sept’2018 which was faster than the adoption of the previous biosimilar (infliximab-dyyb), listed on VANF in May’2017","INCHEON, Korea, Oct. 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. today announced results from two real-world studies of RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) registered in the U.S. Veteran Affairs Healthcare System database. The data were presented for the first time at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2020 Annual Scientific Meeting, which is held virtually from October 23-28, 2020.

One nationwide study evaluated the safety of switching from reference infliximab or infliximab-dyyb to RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) in patients with IBD identified from the VAHS database. Among 298 patients who were switched to RENFLEXIS®, continuation rate was 83% over one year. The study also found that continuation rates were similar between patients who underwent a single switch from reference infliximab to RENFLEXIS® or double switch from reference infliximab to infliximab-dyyb to RENFLEXIS®, reflecting the safety of switching from either reference product or biosimilar.

Nabeel Khan, MD, Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, who led the study said, “since IBD symptoms can be severe, maintaining a stable condition is important for IBD management. This study demonstrated that patients who were on infliximab, reference product or biosimilar, can remain stable after switching to another biosimilar, without major safety concerns.”

Another study looked at real-world utilization pattern of infliximab products for IBD, within the context of Veterans Affairs National Formulary (VANF) Policy. It found that adoption of RENFLEXIS®, which became the preferred infliximab product on VANF in September 2018, was faster than adoption of the previous biosimilar (infliximab-dyyb) that was listed on VANF in May 2017.

“We are confident that this real-world switch data will provide additional reassurance to gastroenterologists who are treating patients with IBD,” said Seongwon Han, Vice President, Medical & Lifecycle Safety Team Leader, at Samsung Bioepis. He continued “together with our partners, we remain committed to demonstrating the value of biosimilars for patients and physicians, as well as payers.”

Both studies are presented as ePosters, which are available on the ACG 2020 Virtual Meeting Platform.

RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2017 as a biosimilar to REMICADE®1 (infliximab). In the United States, RENFLEXIS® is commercialized by Merck, also known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada. In September 2018, it was awarded a national contract from U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and is currently the only infliximab option listed on the VA National Formulary (VANF). RENFLEXIS® is currently listed at USD 121.43 (National Contract Price)2 on VANF and is expected to bring cost savings of approximately USD 81 million every year for the Veteran Affairs Healthcare System from 2018 to 2023, if widely adopted.3

About two real-world studies of RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) in IBD patients

Abstract P1597: The safety of switching from originator infliximab or CT-P13 to SB2 among a nationwide cohort of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients. Nabeel Khan et al.

For the nationwide retrospective cohort study, a total of 298 patients registered to the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) from Jan 1, 2017 to May 1, 2020 were followed-up for one year after starting treatment with infliximab-abda. Patients who were treated with reference infliximab and/or infliximab-dyyb and maintained stable IBD conditions1 for three months before switching were eligible for the study. The primary outcome observed was the discontinuation rate at one-year, which was 17%. Continuation rates were similar between patients who switched one time (reference infliximab → infliximab-abda) and two times (reference infliximab → infliximab-dyyb → infliximab-abda), at 87% and 82% respectively. 13% of the total patients stopped due to either loss of response, development of antibodies, or a hypersensitivity reaction.

Abstract P1570: Infliximab Biosimilar use for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A National Veterans Affairs Experience. Jessica Johnson et al.

The purpose of the second study was to describe infliximab product selection for Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) during the time frame when biosimilars entered the VA and obtained VANF status. Infliximab products were used in 3,204 Veterans with IBD (60.2% CD, 39.8% UC). Non-formulary use of infliximab occurred in higher percentage of infliximab experienced patients than infliximab-naïve patients. Product selection changed throughout the years, reflecting VANF status: Infliximab was used with the highest frequency in 2016-2017, infliximab-dyyb during 2018, and infliximab-abda during 2019. The time delay between the initial designation as the preferred infliximab product and becoming the most frequently used infliximab product in infliximab-naïve Veterans was five months for infliximab-dyyb and two months for infliximab-abda.

Indications for RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda) for Injection, for intravenous use 100 mg

RENFLEXIS is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker approved in the U.S. for the following indications.

Crohn’s Disease – RENFLEXIS is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. RENFLEXIS is indicated for reducing the number of draining enterocutaneous and rectovaginal fistulas and maintaining fistula closure in adult patients with fistulizing Crohn’s disease.

Pediatric Crohn’s Disease – RENFLEXIS is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in pediatric patients 6 years of age or older with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy

Ulcerative Colitis – RENFLEXIS is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing and maintaining clinical remission and mucosal healing, and eliminating corticosteroid use in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.

Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis — RENFLEXIS is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy

Rheumatoid Arthritis – RENFLEXIS is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in combination with methotrexate (MTX).

Psoriatic Arthritis – RENFLEXIS is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of active arthritis, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

Ankylosing Spondylitis – RENFLEXIS is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Plaque Psoriasis – RENFLEXIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic severe (i.e., extensive and/or disabling) plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy and when other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate. RENFLEXIS should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a physician.

Selected Safety Information about RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda)

SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with infliximab products are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue RENFLEXIS if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.

Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent TB before RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda) use and during therapy.1,2 Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to RENFLEXIS use.
Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, pneumocystosis, and cryptococcosis. Patients may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.
The risks and benefits of treatment with RENFLEXIS should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with RENFLEXIS, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy, who are on treatment for latent TB, or who were previously treated for TB infection.

Risk of infection may be higher in patients greater than 65 years of age, pediatric patients, patients with comorbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressant therapy. In clinical trials, other serious infections observed in patients treated with infliximab products included pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, and skin ulceration.

MALIGNANCIES

Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including infliximab products. Approximately half of these cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of malignancies, including rare malignancies that are usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months after the first dose of therapy. Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants.

Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers, including infliximab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported cases have occurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. Carefully assess the risks and benefits of treatment with RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda), especially in these patient types.

In clinical trials of all TNF inhibitors, more cases of lymphoma were observed compared with controls and the expected rate in the general population. However, patients with Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or plaque psoriasis may be at higher risk for developing lymphoma. In clinical trials of some TNF inhibitors, including infliximab products, more cases of other malignancies were observed compared with controls. The rate of these malignancies among patients treated with infliximab products was similar to that expected in the general population whereas the rate in control patients was lower than expected. Cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported with postmarketing TNF-blocker use. As the potential role of TNF inhibitors in the development of malignancies is not known, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of patients with a current or a past history of malignancy or other risk factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF-blocker therapy, including infliximab products. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer.

A population-based retrospective cohort study found a 2- to 3-fold increase in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer in women with rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab compared to biologics-naïve patients or the general population, particularly those over 60 years of age. A causal relationship between infliximab products and cervical cancer cannot be excluded. Periodic screening should continue in women treated with infliximab products.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda) is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe (NYHA Class III/IV) congestive heart failure (CHF) at doses greater than 5 mg/kg. Higher mortality rates at the 10 mg/kg dose and higher rates of cardiovascular events at the 5 mg/kg dose have been observed in these patients. RENFLEXIS should be used with caution and only after consideration of other treatment options. Patients should be monitored closely. Discontinue RENFLEXIS if new or worsening CHF symptoms appear. RENFLEXIS should not be (re)administered to patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction or to patients with hypersensitivity to murine proteins or other components of the product.

HEPATITIS B REACTIVATION

TNF inhibitors, including infliximab products, have been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases were fatal. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating RENFLEXIS. For patients who test positive, consult a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B. Exercise caution when prescribing RENFLEXIS for patients identified as carriers of HBV and monitor closely for active HBV infection during and following termination of therapy with RENFLEXIS. Discontinue RENFLEXIS in patients who develop HBV reactivation and initiate antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. Exercise caution when considering resumption of RENFLEXIS and monitor patients closely.

HEPATOTOXICITY

Severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis, and cholestasis have been reported rarely in patients receiving infliximab products postmarketing. Some cases were fatal or required liver transplant. Aminotransferase elevations were not noted prior to discovery of liver injury in many cases. Patients with symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction should be evaluated for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or marked liver enzyme elevations (e.g., ≥5 times the upper limit of normal) develop, RENFLEXIS should be discontinued, and a thorough investigation of the abnormality should be undertaken.

HEMATOLOGIC EVENTS

Cases of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia (some fatal) have been reported in patients using infliximab products. The causal relationship to infliximab therapy remains unclear. Exercise caution in patients who have ongoing or a history of significant hematologic abnormalities. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms of blood dyscrasias or infection. Consider discontinuation of RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda) in patients who develop significant hematologic abnormalities.

HYPERSENSITIVITY

Infliximab products have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions that differ in their time of onset and required hospitalization in some cases. Most hypersensitivity reactions, which include anaphylaxis, urticaria, dyspnea, and hypotension, have occurred during or within 2 hours of infusion. Serious infusion reactions including anaphylaxis were infrequent. RENFLEXIS should be discontinued for severe hypersensitivity reactions. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions should be available.

CARDIOVASCULAR AND CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIONS DURING AND AFTER INFUSION

Serious cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial ischemia/infarction (some fatal), hypotension, hypertension, and arrhythmias have been reported during and within 24 hours of initiation of infliximab infusion. Cases of transient visual loss have been reported during or within 2 hours of infusion of infliximab. Monitor patients during infusion and, if a serious reaction occurs, discontinue infusion. Manage reactions according to signs and symptoms.

NEUROLOGIC EVENTS

TNF inhibitors, including infliximab products, have been associated in rare cases with CNS manifestation of systemic vasculitis, seizure, and new onset or exacerbation of CNS demyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disorders, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Exercise caution when considering RENFLEXIS in patients with these disorders and consider discontinuation if these disorders develop.

AUTOIMMUNITY

Treatment with infliximab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.

USE WITH OTHER DRUGS

Concomitant use of RENFLEXIS with anakinra, abatacept, tocilizumab, or other biologics used to treat the same conditions as RENFLEXIS is not recommended because of the possibility of an increased risk of infection. Care should be taken when switching from one biologic to another, since overlapping biological activity may further increase the risk of infection.

LIVE VACCINES/THERAPEUTIC INFECTIOUS AGENTS

Live vaccines or therapeutic infectious agents should not be given with RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda) due to the possibility of clinical infections, including disseminated infections. Bring pediatric patients up to date with all vaccinations prior to initiating RENFLEXIS. At least a 6-month waiting period following birth is recommended before the administration of any live vaccine to infants exposed in utero to infliximab products.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In clinical trials with infliximab products, the most common adverse reactions occurring in >10% of patients treated with infliximab products included infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis, and pharyngitis), infusion-related reactions, headache, and abdominal pain.

51079,Sanofi and Regeneron Report Results of Dupixent (dupilumab) in Part A of P-lll Study for Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE),Dupixent® (dupilumab) late-breaking pivotal data showing significant improvement in eosinophilic esophagitis signs and symptoms presented for the first time at scientific meetings,"Part A of P-lll study involves assessing of Dupixent (qw, 300mg) vs PBO in 81 patients aged≥ 12 yrs. with EoE. The study resulted in meeting its co-primary and all key 2EPs, presented at the virtual ACG 2020 and UEG Week 2020
 Results: Patients reported significant improvement on DSQ as 4 wks. and continued to improve through 24 wks; reduced EEC (<15) eos/hpf (64% vs 8%) @24wks. Peak EEC (71% vs 3%). ET changes associated with the disease reduced (0.761 and 0.753 vs 0.001 and 0.012) reduction @24wks.; gene expression patterns associated with type 2 inflammation and EoE were reduced (1.97-fold & 2.66-fold vs 0.32-fold & 0.16-fold); SAEs (86% vs 82%)
 Dupixent is mAb inhibiting the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 proteins and has received the US FDA’s BT designation for the treatment of patients ≥12yrs. with EoE","PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – October 26, 2020 – Additional positive results were announced from Part A of a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in patients 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). As previously reported, the trial met both of its co-primary and all key secondary endpoints. New late-breaking data showing additional improvements in disease severity and extent at the microscopic level, as well as normalization of gene expression pattern associated with type 2 inflammation, were presented at the virtual American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Annual Scientific Meeting and the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week Virtual 2020.

There are currently no FDA-approved medicines for EoE, a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. Over time, excessive type 2 inflammation may cause scarring and narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow. EoE can affect a patient’s ability to eat and cause food to become stuck after being swallowed (food impaction), which can lead to a medical emergency.

Previously announced results showed Dupixent improved symptomatic, structural and histologic measures of EoE. The use of Dupixent to treat EoE is investigational and has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

“The results from this trial show dupilumab significantly improved both patients’ ability to swallow as well as structural abnormalities in the esophagus, by targeting type 2 inflammation to help reverse tissue damage and scarring that usually worsens over time,” said Evan S. Dellon, M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and principal investigator of the trial. “These results also demonstrate that eosinophilic esophagitis is a disease caused by factors beyond just the presence of elevated eosinophils. Dupilumab, which targets the activity of the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 that drive type 2 inflammation, was able to show significant improvements in a broad range of clinical, anatomic, cellular and molecular measures.”

Part A of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 81 patients aged 12 years and older with EoE, who were treated with Dupixent 300 mg weekly over a 24-week treatment period or placebo.

New results presented at virtual ACG 2020 and UEG Week 2020 showed patients treated with Dupixent experienced:

Rapid improvement in ability and comfort of swallowing: patients reported significant improvement on the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) as early as 4 weeks and continued to improve through 24 weeks (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively).
Reduced esophageal eosinophil count below the diagnostic disease threshold: 64% of patients treated with Dupixent achieved <15 eosinophils/high-power field (eos/hpf) compared to 8% for placebo at 24 weeks (p<0.001). Peak esophageal eosinophil count was reduced by 71% with Dupixent compared to 3% with placebo from baseline (p<0.001).
Reduced severity and extent of the disease at the microscopic level: the grade and stage scores that measure esophageal tissue changes associated with the disease were reduced by 0.761 and 0.753 with Dupixent compared to a 0.001 and 0.012 reduction for placebo at 24 weeks; the EoE Histology Scoring System (EoE-HSS) grade and stage scores measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on four-point scales, respectively (p<0.001 for all values).
Normalized gene expression in esophageal tissue: gene expression patterns associated with type 2 inflammation and EoE were reduced by 1.97-fold and 2.66-fold, compared to a 0.32-fold and 0.16-fold reduction with placebo, respectively, as measured by the Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) at 24 weeks from baseline. The NES evaluated a panel of genes associated with type 2 inflammation or EoE (p<0.001 for all values). The changes observed with Dupixent demonstrate a shift in gene expression pattern from one that resembles EoE disease to a pattern that resembles healthy controls.
The trial demonstrated similar safety results to the well-established safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. For the 24-week treatment period, overall rates of adverse events were 86% for Dupixent and 82% for placebo. Adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent included injection site reactions (n=15 for Dupixent, n=12 for placebo) and upper respiratory tract infections (n=11 for Dupixent, n=6 for placebo). There was one treatment discontinuation in the Dupixent group due to joint pain.

In September, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with EoE. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs in the U.S. that target serious or life-threatening conditions. Drugs qualifying for this designation must show preliminary clinical evidence that it may demonstrate a substantial improvement on clinically significant endpoints over available therapies, or over placebo if there are no available therapies. In 2017, Dupixent also was granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE. This is given to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. and in which no adequate medicines have been developed and approved.

Dupixent is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) proteins. Data from Dupixent clinical trials have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis.

About the Dupixent eosinophilic esophagitis trial

The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adolescents and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. Part A of the trial enrolled 81 patients (42 treated with Dupixent and 39 with placebo) aged 12 years and older with EoE, as determined by histological and patient-reported measures. The co-primary endpoints assessed the change from baseline in the DSQ, a patient-reported measure of difficulty swallowing, and the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf, a measure of esophageal inflammation, at 24 weeks. Key secondary endpoints of the trial assessed histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus, as measured by the EoE-HSS grade and stage scores, and the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of <15 eos/hpf at 24 weeks. Other secondary endpoints of the trial assessed NES for the relative change from baseline to week 24 in the EoE diagnostic panel and type 2 inflammation transcriptome signatures. In total, 85% of these patients suffered from at least one concurrent atopic condition such as allergic rhinitis, food allergy and asthma. Patients received weekly subcutaneous injections of Dupixent 300 mg or placebo for the 24-week treatment period.

The EoE trial is ongoing, with additional patients enrolling in Part B as well as patients continuing in a 28-week extended active treatment period (Part C) after completing either Part A or Part B. Part B of the trial is evaluating an additional Dupixent dosing regimen.

About Dupixent

Dupixent is approved for adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, asthma and/or in adults with CRSwNP in a number of countries around the world, including the European Union and Japan, as well as the U.S. where Dupixent is also approved for children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is currently approved in more than 60 countries, and more than 190,000 patients have been treated globally.

Dupilumab development program

To date, dupilumab has been studied in more than 10,000 patients across 50 clinical trials in various chronic diseases driven by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, including EoE (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), pediatric asthma (6 to 11 years of age, Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), and food and environmental allergies (Phase 2). These potential uses are investigational, and the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.

51089,Novartis Presents Results of Iptacopan (LNP023) in P-ll Study for C3 Glomerulopathy at ASN Annual Meeting 2020,Novartis presents promising interim Phase II data of potential first-in-class oral therapy iptacopan (LNP023) in rare renal disease C3 glomerulopathy (C3G),"The P-II study involves assessing the efficacy, safety and PK of Iptacopan (LNP023) in patients with C3G (Cohort A) and patients who have undergone a kidney transplant and have C3G recurrence (Cohort B), interim results presented at ASN 2020
 Result: @12wks., reduction in proteinuria (49%) as measured by 24hrs. UPCR assessment; improvement in plasma C3 level; inhibit alternative complement pathway activity; stabilized renal function as assessed by eGFR
 Iptacopan (PO) is a first-in-class reversible inhibitor of factor B and has received EMA’s PRIME designation for iptacopan in C3G and EMA’s ODD in IgAN. The therapy is in development for multiple renal conditions including C3G, IgAN, aHUS, iMN as well as in PNH which is a hematological disease","Basel, October 26, 2020 — Novartis today announced positive Phase II interim analysis results for iptacopan (LNP023), an investigational oral treatment for C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), presented at the virtually held American Society of Nephrology (ASN) 2020 Annual Meeting.

Data from the open-label Phase II study (NCT03832114), showed that after 12 weeks, iptacopan significantly reduced proteinuria by 49% compared to baseline values, as measured by 24-hour urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) assessment, in twelve patients with C3G (P=0.0005). Iptacopan strongly inhibited alternative complement pathway activity and improved plasma C3 levels. In addition, iptacopan stabilized renal function as assessed by eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) at week 12 and this effect was maintained in the seven patients that were treated for a total of six months after rolling over into the long-term extension study (NCT03955445)7.

“Proteinuria indicates the presence of inflammation in the kidney. Results from this study demonstrate that iptacopan significantly reduces proteinuria in patients with C3G,” said the lead study investigator, Dr Edwin Wong, Consultant Nephrologist at the National Renal Complement Therapeutics Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle University. “This data also highlights iptacopan’s ability to strongly and specifically inhibit the alternative complement pathway, targeting the underlying cause of this disease and potentially providing a much needed treatment option for C3G patients who have significant unmet needs.”

Iptacopan also had a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this Phase II study with no deaths, no serious adverse events suspected to be related to iptacopan and no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.

“Iptacopan is the most advanced asset in our nephrology pipeline.” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer at Novartis. “These data demonstrate that it has the potential to improve the lives of patients with C3G.”

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted PRIME designation for iptacopan in C3G. PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. This voluntary program is based on enhanced interaction and early dialogue with developers of promising medicines, to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so these medicines can reach patients earlier. In addition, EMA has also granted an orphan drug designation for iptacopan in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).

About C3 glomerulopathy (C3G)
C3G is an ultra-rare and severe form of primary glomerulonephritis, characterized by complement dysregulation.1,9 It has a worldwide annual incidence of 1–2 per million11 and an approximate prevalence of 10,000 in the US, ~10,500 in Europe, 3,200 in Japan and 32,000 in China12.

C3G is commonly diagnosed in adolescents and young adults. The disease has a poor prognosis; about 50% of patient progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years, and 50–70% experience disease recurrence post kidney transplant.2

Currently, there are no approved therapies specifically designed to target the underlying complement dysregulation that occurs in people with C3G. Current standard of care is with non-specific immunosuppressants with limited clinical evidence. Although antihypertensive or immunosuppressive agents and terminal complement pathway blockers are helpful in some patients, no treatment is universally effective or curative. 2,3,9,10 Therefore, novel treatment options are needed to address disease symptoms and slow the progression of C3G.

About iptacopan
Iptacopan (LNP023) is a first-in-class oral, small-molecule, reversible inhibitor of factor B, a key serine protease of the alternative pathway of the complement cascade.4,5

In addition to C3G, iptacopan is in parallel development for a number of other renal conditions with complement system involvement where significant unmet needs exist, including IgA nephropathy, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and membranous nephropathy.

Novartis is also investigating iptacopan in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Following positive Phase II data presented at the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) congress in August, a randomized, active-comparator controlled open-label Phase III trial (NCT04558918) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iptacopan in PNH patients with residual anemia despite treatment with anti-C5 antibody therapy is planned to start in Dec 2020.13

Iptacopan has the potential to become the first alternative complement pathway inhibitor to slow disease progression in a number of complement driven diseases.

About the Study
The study (NCT03832114) is a Phase II, open-label, two cohort, non-randomized study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of iptacopan in patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) (Cohort A) and patients who have undergone kidney transplant and have C3G recurrence (Cohort B).14 On completion of the study, patients can roll over into a long-term extension study (NCT03955445).

About Sugemalimab (PD-L1)

Sugemalimab is an investigational anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody discovered by CStone. Authorized by a company based in the U.S., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: LGND), sugemalimab is developed using the OmniRat® transgenic animal platform, which can generate fully human antibodies in one stop. As a fully human, full-length anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, sugemalimab mirrors the natural G-type immunoglobulin 4 (“IgG4”) human antibody, which may reduce the risk of immunogenicity and toxicities in patients, a potentially unique advantage over similar drugs.

Sugemalimab has completed a Phase I dose-escalation study in China. During Phase 1a and 1b stages of the study, sugemalimab showed antitumor activity in multiple tumor types and was well-tolerated.

Currently, sugemalimab is being investigated in a number of ongoing clinical trials. In addition to a Phase I bridging study in the U.S., the clinical programs in China include one multi-arm Phase Ib study for several tumor types, one Phase II registrational study for lymphoma, and four Phase III registrational studies, respectively, for stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer. The phase III clinical trial of sugemalimab in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer has reached its primary endpoint.

Exact Sciences also Announces Acquisition of Base Genomics to Advance its DNA Methylation Capabilities

MADISON, Wis. and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Exact Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: EXAS) and Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. (“Thrive”), a healthcare company dedicated to incorporating earlier cancer detection into routine medical care, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Exact Sciences will acquire Thrive for cash and stock consideration of up to $2.15 billion. The transaction was unanimously approved by both companies’ Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close during the first quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval and the satisfaction of other conditions.

Combining Thrive’s pioneering early-stage screening test, CancerSEEK, with Exact Sciences’ best-in-class scientific platform, clinical organization, and commercial infrastructure will establish Exact Sciences as a leading competitor in blood-based, multi-cancer screening. Thrive, with an early version of CancerSEEK, has conducted a first-of-its-kind 10,000-patient, prospective, interventional study in a real-world clinical setting. In this landmark study, using its mutation and protein biomarker approach, CancerSEEK achieved promising results detecting 10 different types of cancer, including seven with no recommended screening guidelines, with very few false positives. Bringing together highly complementary scientific approaches and the strengths of both organizations, Exact Sciences expects to develop a more accurate test and accelerate the widespread adoption of this potentially life-saving advancement.

“The acquisition of Thrive is a giant leap toward ensuring blood-based, multi-cancer screening becomes a reality and eventually, the standard of care. We couldn’t be more excited that Exact Sciences will be at the forefront of this incredible opportunity to serve patients,” said Kevin Conroy, Chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. “We have long respected the Thrive team for their rigorous scientific approach, having participated in both funding rounds as an investor. We are proud to take our partnership to the next level by leveraging Exact Sciences’ established R&D team and highly accurate testing platform to augment development of CancerSEEK and accelerate its commercialization. By combining the expertise of both organizations, we believe we can bring this powerful technology to patients faster.”

“Thrive is driven by the knowledge that if cancer is caught early enough, it can be more effectively treated or even cured, and every patient deserves a chance for a better outcome,” said David Daly, CEO of Thrive. “Our team has made significant progress toward our mission and we are eager to collaborate with and benefit from Exact Sciences’ expertise, and believe that together we will enable broader, quicker adoption of our test. With the support of our ongoing partnership with Johns Hopkins University, we are energized to contribute meaningfully to our shared mission of advancing the fight against cancer and providing life-changing answers to patients in need.”

Creating a Leader in Blood-Based, Multi-Cancer Screening

Transforming the Future of Cancer Diagnostics with a Premier R&D Team: The Exact Sciences R&D team has robust clinical and evidence generation capabilities. This powerful team will be complemented and enhanced by the addition of Thrive’s R&D groups specializing in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics in liquid biopsy. The combined R&D team’s impact will be amplified by Exact Sciences’ database of proprietary biomarkers, extensive blood sample biorepository, financial strength, and each company’s established partnerships with leading institutions, including Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins University.
Accelerating the Approval, Availability, and Adoption of Multi-Cancer Screening: Exact Sciences is uniquely positioned to support the development of Thrive’s CancerSEEK product and facilitate its success. By leveraging Exact Sciences’ proven clinical and regulatory teams, scaled laboratory and IT capabilities, and well-established primary care sales team and direct-to-consumer marketing experience, the Company expects to bring blood-based, multi-cancer screening to patients faster and with greater certainty.
Positioning Exact Sciences as a Leader in a $25 Billion+ Market and Demonstrating Capabilities as a Research and Commercialization Partner-of-Choice: The need to detect the deadliest cancers at earlier, more treatable stages is urgent, and multi-cancer screening can be an impactful solution. Thrive has conducted a large study in a real-world clinical setting, with promising results at a low false positive rate. By joining with Thrive, Exact Sciences would be well-positioned to compete in a significant U.S. market, estimated to be at least $25 billion. Exact Sciences is already home to two of the strongest and fastest-growing brands in cancer diagnostics, Cologuard® and Oncotype DX®. With the addition of Thrive, Exact Sciences would have the scientific rigor necessary to bring tests to patients at every step of their cancer journey, from screening to minimal residual disease, recurrence monitoring, and therapy selection. This rigor and Exact Sciences’ existing commercial strength further distinguish the Company as a leading developer and provider of innovative products across the cancer continuum.

51143,Sanofi Presents Results of Olipudase Alfa in Two Clinical Studies at ASHG 2020,Olipudase alfa demonstrated significant improvement in lung function and spleen volume in patients with ASMD,"The P-II/III ASCEND trial involves assessing olipudase alfa 3 mg/kg (IV, q2w) vs PBO in 36 adult patients with ASMD type B to evaluate treatment impact on pulmonary function & spleen & liver volume for 52wks. The study demonstrated improvement in lung function (22% vs 3%), reduction in spleen volume (39.5% vs 0.5%), reduction in liver volume (31.7% vs 1.4%); improvement in platelet counts (16.8% vs 2.5%)
 The P-II ASCEND-Peds trial involves assessing olipudase alfa 3 mg/kg (IV) q2w for 64 wks, in 20 pediatric patients with ASMD without acute or rapidly progressive neurological abnormalities. The study demonstrated 33% increment in predicted DLCO, reduction in spleen volume & liver volume (49% & 41%); 34% increment in platelet count
 Olipudase alfa is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy designed to replace deficient or defective ASM, allowing for the breakdown of sphingomyelin, currently being investigated to treat non-CNS manifestations of ASMD. The therapy has received FDA’s BT designation, EMA’s PRIME Designation and MHLW’s SAKIGAKE designation","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. – October 27, 2020– Olipudase alfa, an investigational recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase, demonstrated significant improvement in lung function and spleen volume in patients with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD). Results from two separate clinical trials of adult and pediatric patients were presented at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2020 Virtual Meeting this week and will form the basis of global regulatory submissions expected to begin in the second half of 2021.

Historically referred to as Niemann-Pick Disease (NPD) type A and type B, ASMD is a rare, lysosomal storage disease that results from a deficient activity of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), which is found in special compartments within cells called lysosomes and is required to breakdown lipids called sphingomyelin. If ASM is absent or not functioning as it should, sphingomyelin cannot be metabolized properly and accumulates within cells, eventually causing cell death and the malfunction of major organ systems. The deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme ASM is due to disease-causing variants in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 gene (SMPD1). The overall global estimated incidence of ASMD is 0.4-0.6 in 100,000 births.i,ii

“ASMD is a progressive and potentially life-threatening genetic disease with no approved treatment options,” said Melissa Wasserstein, MD, Chief, Division of Pediatric Genetic Medicine, Children’s Hospital at Montefiore; Professor of Pediatrics and Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. “Results from both the adult and pediatric clinical trials with olipudase alfa clearly demonstrate the potential of this investigational therapy to impact visceral manifestations of ASMD and have a meaningful impact on the lives of those impacted by this devastating disease.”

Data in Adult Patients with ASMD (ASCEND)

The Phase 2/3 trial randomized 36 adult patients with ASMD type B to receive either placebo or olipudase alfa up to 3 mg/kg administered via intravenous infusion every two weeks for 52 weeksiii to evaluate treatment impact on pulmonary function and spleen and liver volume. An open-label, single-arm extension of this study is ongoing to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of olipudase alfa.

Lung function at 52 weeks:

Olipudase alfa significantly improved lung function by 22% from baseline compared to 3% for patients receiving placebo (p=0.0004), as measured by percent predicted diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO).
Spleen volume and Splenomegaly Related Score (SRS) at 52 weeks:

Olipudase alfa significantly reduced spleen volume by 39.5% compared with a 0.5% increase in the placebo arm (p<0.0001), as assessed by percent change from baseline in multiples of normal (MN) of spleen volume.
For the US, this was combined with the SRS, a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement that evaluated patient symptoms associated with an enlarged spleen. There was no meaningful difference between the treatment and placebo arms (8.0 point decrease for olipudase alfa vs. 9.3 point reduction for placebo; p=0.70); therefore this combination endpoint was not met for the US.
Our analysis of the SRS data did not find a correlation with spleen volume at baseline, nor was the change in SRS correlated with the change in spleen volume at week 52.
Liver volume and platelet count at 52 weeks (pre-specified secondary endpoints):

Olipudase alfa reduced liver volume by 31.7%, compared with a 1.4% decrease in the placebo arm, as measured by percent change from baseline in MN of liver volume.
Mean platelet counts improved by 16.8% in olipudase alfa versus 2.5% in placebo-treated patients.
Overall safety and tolerability profile at 52 weeks:

All patients in the placebo and olipudase alfa arms experienced at least one adverse event (AE). The number of events was lower in the olipudase alfa arm (242 events) compared with the placebo arm (267 events).
Severe AEs were less frequent in the olipudase alfa arm (3 events) compared with the placebo arm (13 events).
There were five serious AEs in the olipudase alfa arm and 11 in the placebo arm, none of which were treatment related. There were no adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation or study withdrawal.
Infusion associated reactions were mild to moderate, with 44% of olipudase alfa patients and 33% of placebo patients experiencing infusion-related reactions.
The most common AEs in the trial were headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and arthralgia (as defined by percentages of events ≥ 2% and number of olipudase alfa treated patients ≥ 2).
Treatment-induced anti-drug antibodies occurred in 22% of olipudase alfa patients.
“These are powerful data evidenced by statistically significant improvement in lung function and spleen volume and clinically meaningful reduction in liver volume,” said Karin Knobe, Head of Development of Rare Diseases and Rare Blood Disorders at Sanofi. “The totality of the study data shows olipudase alfa has the potential to provide meaningful improvements to adults who have lived with a debilitating rare disease for decades.”

Data in Pediatric Patients with ASMD (ASCEND-Peds)

This single arm, open label Phase 2 trial of 20 pediatric patients (birth to <18 years) with ASMD without acute or rapidly progressive neurological abnormalities evaluated the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa up to 3 mg/kg administered intravenously every two weeks for 64 weeks.iv All 20 patients completed the study and continue in an extension trial.

Safety data at 64 weeks:

All patients treated with olipudase alfa in the trial experienced treatment-emergent AEs that were mostly mild or moderate.
Eleven patients had infusion-associated reactions. The most frequent were: urticaria (4 patients), pyrexia (7 patients) and vomiting (6 patients).
Five treatment-related serious adverse events were observed in three patients: two cases of transient, asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase in one patient, one case each of urticaria and rash in one patient, and one anaphylactic reaction in one patient.
No patients had to permanently discontinue treatment due to an adverse event.
The most common AEs were pyrexia, cough, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, contusion, abdominal pain, nasal congestion, rash, urticaria, scratch, and epistaxis (as defined by percentages of events ≥2% and number of olipudase alfa-treated patients ≥2).
Also presented were 52-week exploratory efficacy results, defined as secondary objectives in the trial, measuring lung function, spleen and liver volume, and patient growth. These results showed improvement in these clinically relevant disease endpoints.

Percent predicted DLCO increased by a mean of 33% (32.9% + 29.1%) in nine patients who were able to perform the test at baseline (children over the age of five were assessed if they were able to perform the test).
Spleen volume decreased by 49% (49.2% + 9.7%) and liver volume by 41% (40.6% + 9.4%), as assessed by mean MN.
Fifteen patients (78.9%) improved in the Height Z-score category, and four (21.1%) patients remained in the same category.
Platelet count increased 34% (34.0% +36.42%).
About ASMD

ASMD represents a spectrum of disease caused by the same enzymatic deficiency, with two types that may represent opposite ends of a continuum, sometimes referred to as ASMD type A and ASMD type B. ASMD type A is a rapidly progressive neurological form of the disease resulting in death in early childhood due to CNS complications. ASMD type B, is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease that predominantly, but not only, impacts the lungs, liver, spleen and heart. ASMD type A/B represents an intermediate form that includes varying degrees of neurologic involvement. Patients with ASMD type A/B or ASMD type B were studied in the ASCEND trial program. Another type of NPD is NPD type C, which is unrelated to ASMD.

About olipudase alfa

Olipudase alfa is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy designed to replace deficient or defective ASM, allowing for the breakdown of sphingomyelin. Olipudase alfa is currently being investigated to treat non-CNS manifestations of ASMD. Olipudase alfa has not been studied in ASMD type A patients.

Olipudase alfa is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority worldwide.

The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to olipudase alfa. This designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. The criteria for granting Breakthrough Therapy designation include preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the molecule may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available therapies.

The EMA has awarded PRIority MEdicines, also known as PRIME, designation to olipudase alfa. This designation is designed to aid and expedite the regulatory process for investigational medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options.

Olipudase alfa was awarded the SAKIGAKE designation in Japan. SAKIGAKE is intended to promote research and development in Japan for innovative new medical products that satisfy certain criteria, such as the severity of the intended indication.

51174,Novartis Signs an Option and License Agreement with Molecular Partners to Develop Two DARPin Therapies for COVID-19,Novartis announces collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19,"Molecular Partners to receive $65.8M as up front, including equity, and will receive $164.7M as an option payment for both MP0420 and MP0423 along with royalties on sales of therapies. Novartis to get an option to in-license global rights of MP0420 and MP0423
 During the option period, Molecular Partners will conduct a P-I study for MP0420, expected to initiate in Nov’2020, and perform all remaining preclinical work for MP0423 while Novartis will lead P-II & P-III study
 Upon option exercise, Novartis will lead further development and commercialization activities while Molecular Partners will provide clinical supply during the development stage. MP0420 and MP0423 are potential medicines for the prevention & treatment of COVID-19, with the possibility of being manufactured at scale and the potential to bypass cold storage","Basel, October 28, 2020 — Novartis and Molecular Partners AG today announced a collaboration in the form of an option and license agreement to develop, manufacture and commercialize Molecular Partners’ anti-COVID-19 DARPin® program, consisting of two therapeutic candidates, MP0420 and MP0423. The collaboration aims to leverage Molecular Partners’ proprietary DARPin® technologies and Novartis broad expertise in global drug development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and commercialization to rapidly advance the program in keeping with the unprecedented global urgency created by the pandemic.

Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of those efforts, it has become increasingly clear that to tackle the pandemic at a global level the development of medicines that can prevent and treat the virus, in addition to the development of vaccines, will be crucial. Multiple treatment options increases the likelihood of reaching and treating patients around the world and, in addition, may be especially important for certain populations at greater risk who may benefit from a prophylactic treatment. MP0420 and MP0423 are potential medicines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, with the possibility of being manufactured at scale and the potential to bypass cold storage.

“Novartis remains unwavering in its support for tackling COVID-19 and it is clear that this pandemic calls for not just scientific solutions, but also for collaboration between companies to provide treatments in an area of high unmet need. This Swiss led partnership, which could deliver both prophylactic and treatment options at scale for COVID-19 patients across the globe, is another demonstration of our sustained commitment to addressing one of the greatest health challenges of our time,” said Vas Narasimhan, Chief Executive Officer of Novartis.

Molecular Partners are a Swiss based clinical-stage biotech company that are developing a new class of custom-built protein therapeutics known as DARPin® therapeutics. Under the agreement, during the option period, Molecular Partners will conduct Phase 1 clinical trials for MP0420, expected to begin in November 2020, and perform all remaining preclinical work for MP0423 and Novartis will conduct Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, with Molecular Partners as sponsor of these trials. Upon option exercise, Novartis would be responsible for all further development and commercialization activities. During the clinical development stage, Molecular Partners will provide clinical supply. The companies will work together to scale-up manufacturing capacity, in collaboration with Sandoz, the generics and biosimilar Novartis division, to provide worldwide supply.

Several characteristics of DARPin® therapeutics make them ideally suited for antiviral therapy including multi-specific target binding with the potential to prevent viral escape via mutations, the possibility for subcutaneous administration, long half-life for sustained activity, the potential to bypass cold storage and typically high-yield, highly scalable production in bacterial fermenters. These factors provide the possibility of developing and manufacturing this innovation at scale. This supports the commitment of both companies to leverage their respective strengths and expertise to urgently develop these two potential treatments and if the data are positive, facilitate access to these medicines for patients around the world as quickly as possible.

“Our team rapidly mobilized to deliver a unique DARPin®-based approach to address the overwhelming need for effective therapeutics against COVID-19. As a class, DARPins have demonstrated over years of clinical research a number of characteristics that enhance their profile as antiviral therapeutics for a global pandemic. We have built on this long-term research with these two candidates, which have demonstrated extremely potent neutralization of the virus through inhibiting multiple viral mechanisms,” said Patrick Amstutz, Chief Executive Officer of Molecular Partners. “We are thrilled to partner with Novartis, who has shown great commitment to combatting this pandemic and bringing innovative solutions to people around the world.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Molecular Partners will receive an upfront payment of CHF 60 million, including equity.

Molecular Partners will receive a further payment of CHF 150 million, upon Novartis electing to take up the option to both therapeutic candidates, and significant royalty on sales. Molecular Partners has agreed to forgo royalties in lower income countries, and is aligned with Novartis’ plans to ensure affordability based on countries’ needs and capabilities.

Novartis response to COVID-19 Pandemic
Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis has been active in two key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard, as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). The company is also separately supporting COVID-19 related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low- and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is found. This includes dexamethasone which is the only medicine shown to decrease mortality so far in severe hospitalized COVID pneumonia patients. Novartis also announced a collaboration with the African Union (AU) through the Africa Medical Supplies Platform (AMSP) to facilitate the supply of medicines from the Novartis Pandemic Response Portfolio to the AU member states and Caricom countries. Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID.

51192,AstraZeneca's Forxiga (dapagliflozin) Receive NMPA's Approval for Label Update to Include Data of P-III DECLARE-TIMI 58 Study,Forxiga cardiovascular outcomes benefit approved in China,"The updated label includes P-III DECLARE-TIMI 58 study that assesses the effect of Forxiga vs PBO on CV outcomes in 17000+ patients with T2D at risk of CV events also assessed key renal 2EPs, across 882 sites in 33 countries
 The study demonstrated that Forxiga achieved a significant reduction in the composite EP of hHF or CV death. The trial confirmed the well-established safety profile of Forxiga
 The NMPA’s label update follows the update to the EU MAA in Aug’2019 and the US FDA’s approval granted in Oct’2019","Update to approval includes DECLARE-TIMI 58 Phase III trial that reduced the risk of composite of hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death in type-2 diabetes
China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has updated the label for AstraZeneca’s Forxiga (dapagliflozin) to include data from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 Phase III trial.

DECLARE-TIMI 58 demonstrated that Forxiga achieved a statistically significant reduction in the composite endpoint of hospitalisation for heart failure (hHF) or cardiovascular (CV) death, versus placebo, in adults with type-2 diabetes (T2D) and established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors. The trial confirmed the well-established safety profile of Forxiga.1

DECLARE-TIMI 58 is the largest sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor CV outcomes trial conducted to date, and data from the trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in January 2019.

There are an estimated 463 million people living with diabetes worldwide, with nearly 120 million in China.2 Patients with T2D are two to five times more likely to develop chronic heart failure (HF) than those without T2D.3

Ruud Dobber, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit, said: “Heart failure is one of the first cardiovascular complications for patients with type-2 diabetes. The DECLARE-TIMI 58 Phase III data show that Forxiga reduces the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure and, with this label update, we look forward to bringing this significant benefit to patients in China.”

Forxiga is indicated as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapies to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D. The NMPA label update, based on the DECLARE-TIMI 58 Phase III data, follows the update to the EU marketing authorisation in August 2019 and the approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2019 of an indication for Forxiga (known as Farxiga in the US) to reduce the risk of hHF in adults with T2D and established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors.

In May 2020, Farxiga was approved in the US to reduce the risk of CV death and hHF in adults with HF (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with and without T2D, and in October 2020 Forxiga was recommended for approval for HF in the EU by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. Additionally, the FDA granted Farxiga Breakthrough Therapy Designation in October 2020 to accelerate the development and regulatory review for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with and without T2D.

Type-2 diabetes

T2D is a chronic disease characterised by pathophysiologic defects leading to elevated glucose levels, or hyperglycaemia.2 Over time, this sustained hyperglycaemia contributes to further progression of the disease.2 The prevalence of diabetes is projected to reach 578 million people worldwide by 2030, and 700 million by 2045.2 T2D accounts for approximately 90-95 percent of all cases of diagnosed diabetes.4

DECLARE-TIMI 58

DECLARE-TIMI 58 is an AstraZeneca-sponsored, Phase III, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial designed to evaluate the effect of Forxiga compared with placebo on CV outcomes in adults with T2D at risk of CV events, including patients with multiple CV risk factors or established CV disease, and also assessed key renal secondary endpoints. The trial included more than 17,000 patients across 882 sites in 33 countries and was independently run in collaboration with academic investigators from the TIMI study group (Boston, US) and the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center (Jerusalem, Israel).1

Forxiga

Forxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction.

Forxiga has been evaluated in patients with CKD in the Phase III DAPA-CKD trial, with the full results announced in August 2020 demonstrating that Forxiga met all primary and secondary endpoints, providing overwhelming efficacy. Forxiga is currently being tested for patients with HF in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) Phase III trials. Forxiga will also be tested in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking registry-based randomised controlled trial. Forxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

51239,Lilly Reports Results of Bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in P-II BLAZE-1 Study in New England Journal of Medicine,Data for Lilly’s bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in COVID-19 outpatients published in New England Journal of Medicine,"The P-II BLAZE-1 study assesses bamlanivimab (700, 2800 & 7000 mg) vs PBO in the outpatient setting in patients with mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than 3 days prior to drug infusion
 Results: The study showed that bamlanivimab may be effective in treating COVID-19 by reducing viral load, symptoms and the risk of hospitalization in patients recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19
 LY-CoV555 is a neutralizing IgG1 mAb directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 & designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing & treating COVID-19","INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The New England Journal of Medicine has published data from the monotherapy arms of BLAZE-1, a Phase 2 study assessing the efficacy and safety of Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) – a neutralizing antibody – in the COVID-19 outpatient setting. This study focused on ambulatory COVID-19 patients being treated in the outpatient setting, whose symptoms did not require hospitalization at the time of enrollment. The publication, which can be found here, follows Lilly’s proof-of-concept data announcement for bamlanivimab as monotherapy in September 2020.

“The publication of these data in a peer-reviewed journal adds to the growing body of evidence for the potential utility for neutralizing antibodies as therapeutics for people recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19, particularly high-risk patients,” said Ajay Nirula, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology at Lilly and co-first author of the study. “These data show bamlanivimab may be effective in treating COVID-19 by reducing viral load, symptoms and the risk of hospitalization in outpatients.”

“It is important to treat people with COVID-19 as soon as possible after diagnosis in order to forestall development of more severe disease,” said Peter Chen, M.D., director of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Cedars-Sinai and co-first author of the study. “Our findings indicate that neutralizing antibodies may have the potential to be useful in this early-stage intervention.”

These data were submitted as part of Lilly’s request for an emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for bamlanivimab in higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19.

About BLAZE-1

BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone or in combination with a second antibody for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than three days prior to drug infusion.

The monotherapy arms of the trial enrolled mild to moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, studying three doses of bamlanivimab (700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg) versus placebo.

The primary outcome measure for the completed arms of the BLAZE-1 trial was change from baseline to day 11 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Additional endpoints include the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through day 29, as well as safety.

The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll over 800 participants.

Data from the BLAZE-1 study show bamlanivimab may be effective in treating COVID-19 by reducing viral load, symptoms and the risk of hospitalization in patients recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19. In the BLAZE-1 trial, rates and types of adverse events were similar between bamlanivimab and placebo, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity and with no drug-related serious adverse events reported thus far. In other bamlanivimab studies, there have been isolated drug-related infusion reactions or hypersensitivity that were generally mild (two reported as serious infusion reactions, both patients recovered).

About bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555)

LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. LY-CoV555 emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628). A Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. A Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987) is also ongoing. In addition, bamlanivimab is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 study of ambulatory COVID-19 patients.

51289,Boehringer Ingelheim Initiates P-II Study of BI 764198 for Patients with Severe Respiratory Illness from COVID-19,Boehringer Ingelheim Begins Phase 2 Clinical Trial of a Targeted Therapy to Help People with Severe Respiratory Illness from COVID-19,"The P-II trial will assess BI 764198 (qd for ~4wks.) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with expected enrollment initiation in Oct’2020. The 1EPs will be the percentage of patients who are alive and free of mechanical ventilation at day 29 of treatment while other EPs include clinical improvement, oxygen saturation & ICU admission
 The therapy has shown a reduction in cellular damage and lung edema in preclinical studies and may provide similar benefits in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. BI 764198 was well tolerated in P-I study in healthy adults
 BI 764198 is potent & selective inhibitor of TRPC6, focusing to reduce the need for ventilator support and to improve patient recovery rate","Ingelheim, Germany – 28. October 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim today announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of BI 764198, an inhibitor of TRPC6, a receptor-operated cation channel. This potent and selective inhibitor of TRPC6 may alleviate the damage to the lung and decrease the risk or severity of acute respiratory complications in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The aim of therapy with BI 764198 is to reduce the need for ventilator support, to improve patient recovery rate and ultimately to save lives. Boehringer Ingelheim is committed to fighting COVID-19 and contributing with its expertise and resources to develop new therapeutic options for patients suffering from the virus’ severe complications.

“COVID-19 can cause serious lung complications, such as viral pneumonia, and in severe cases can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and lung failure,” said Dr. Lorraine B. Ware, Ralph and Lulu Oven Endowed Chair and Professor of Medicine, and Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University. “Patients hospitalized with ARDS due to COVID-19 are often unable to breathe on their own and may require life support from a mechanical ventilator to help supply oxygen to the body. While we hope that future vaccines will help reduce cases of severe COVID-19, there remains an unmet need to address respiratory complications in infected patients, and provide healthcare professionals an effective alternative to mechanical ventilation that can potentially reduce the treatment burden within the hospital setting.”

Approximately 15% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe disease and up to 30% of severely ill patients may require medical care in an intensive care unit (ICU). Between 67 and 85 percent of patients in the ICU develop ARDS, a potentially deadly complication of severe COVID-19.1 Therapeutic options, such as BI 764198, are urgently needed to reduce severe respiratory distress, save lives and ultimately help reduce the incredible burden the virus is placing on healthcare systems.

“This therapy may provide the first potential treatment for COVID-19 related respiratory distress syndrome, helping to close a significant gap in the treatment regimen for COVID-19 patients. As we have understood more in recent months about the pathology of this disease, we realized that BI 764198 might have a unique potential to help the most severely affected patients and we felt compelled to bring it to clinical studies,” said Dr. Mehdi Shahidi, Corporate Senior Vice President Medicine and Chief Medical Officer, Boehringer Ingelheim. “It is our hope that this step forward will provide treating physicians with a new tool to improve the outlook for their hospitalized patients affected by the respiratory complications of COVID-19.”

As a research-driven company, Boehringer Ingelheim is part of the collective effort in fighting COVID-19. Drawing from their areas of expertise, the company has engaged in a number of activities to find medical solutions to this pandemic, working closely with academic researchers, international institutions, and others in the pharma industry. Boehringer Ingelheim is currently involved in a broad set of initiatives to fight the disease and save patients’ lives, including the research and development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that can neutralize the virus, small molecules to inhibit its replication, and therapy development to prevent microcoagulation (blood clots). Boehringer Ingelheim is also an active participant in the global access initiative with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as global development initiatives including the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator (CTA) and the CARE Consortium.

About the Study
This Phase 2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial will evaluate BI 764198 in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with participants taking one capsule per day for up to four weeks. The primary endpoint will be the percentage of patients who are alive and free of mechanical ventilation at day 29 of treatment. Other endpoints include clinical improvement, oxygen saturation and ICU admission. In patients hospitalized for COVID-19, there is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to airway injury. ROS have been shown to activate TRPC6, which may cause a cascade of cellular damage resulting in disruption of cellular barrier function, hyper-permeability, edema and ultimately acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). BI 764198 treatment in animal models of lung injury has been shown to reduce cellular damage and lung edema. Treatment with BI 764198 may provide similar benefits in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. BI 764198 has been shown to be well tolerated in a previous Phase 1 study in healthy adults (NCT03854552).

Trial enrollment for BI 764198 is expected to begin in October 2020 and will include approximately 40 study sites across eight countries. For more information, please visit: clinicaltrials.gov and mystudywindow.com.

51367,Roche's Tecentriq in Combination with Avastin Receives China NMPA's Approval for the Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Roche’s Tecentriq in combination with Avastin approved in China for people with the most common form of liver cancer,"The approval was based on the P-III IMbrave150 study (n=501) assessing the combination of Tecentriq (1200 mg, IV) and Avastin (15 mg/kg, IV) or sorafenib (400 mg, bid) in unresectable HCC patients who had not received prior systemic therapy which included analyses of a cohort of Chinese patients (n=194) from the same study
 Results: Tecentriq in combination with Avastin reduced the risk of OS by 56% (among Chinese patients) and 42% (global results) & the PFS risk by 40% (among Chinese patients) and 41% (global results) as compared with sorafenib
 IMbrave150 is the 1st P-III cancer immunotherapy study to show an improvement in OS and PFS in people with unresectable or metastatic HCC compared with sorafenib. Additionally. in May 2020, the US FDA approved Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for the treatment of people with unresectable or metastatic HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy","Basel, 29 October 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with Avastin® (bevacizumab) for the treatment of people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy.

“Today’s approval of Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma means that people in China now have a cancer immunotherapy option which is changing the treatment landscape for this aggressive disease”, said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “With almost half of the world’s hepatocellular carcinoma cases diagnosed in China, this approval marks a major advance for Chinese patients.”

“In China, primary liver cancer ranks as the fourth most common malignancy and is the second leading cause of cancer death. With most patients diagnosed at the intermediate and advanced stages where surgery or other locoregional therapies are not an option, there is an urgent need for effective treatments for unresectable HCC”, said Prof. Shukui Qin, Leading Principal Investigator of the IMbrave150 study in China and Chairman of the Liver Cancer Expert Committee of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO). “The IMbrave150 study demonstrated that the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin in this setting can significantly improve outcomes for patients. It is truly gratifying news that the combination is now approved in China and gives a new option to Chinese liver cancer patients.”

Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers in China, accounting for nearly 400,000 diagnoses and approximately 368,000 deaths every year, equivalent to over 1,000 per day.1 Only 20% of people with HCC in China are diagnosed in the early stages, when curative treatments are still an option.2 The average 5-year survival rate for people in China with liver cancer is only approximately 15%.3 Roche is committed to tackling liver disease right across the disease journey, from the earliest stages through to advanced disease, with the ultimate goal of one day stopping chronic liver disease.

The approval was based on results of the Phase III IMbrave150 study, which included analyses of a cohort of Chinese patients (n=194) from the same study. Data from this cohort were consistent with the global results. Among Chinese patients, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin reduced the risk of death (overall survival; OS) by 56% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.44; 95% CI: 0.25–0.76) and reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival; PFS) by 40% (HR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.40–0.90), compared with sorafenib. Tecentriq and Avastin were generally well-tolerated with manageable toxicities, and the safety profile was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines and with the underlying disease.

Global results from the IMbrave150 study demonstrated that Tecentriq in combination with Avastin reduced the risk of death (OS) by 42% (HR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.42–0.79; p=0.0006) and reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 41% (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.47–0.76; p<0.0001), compared with sorafenib. IMbrave150 is the first Phase III cancer immunotherapy study to show an improvement in OS and PFS in people with unresectable or metastatic HCC compared with sorafenib. Grade 3–4 adverse events occurred in 57% of people receiving Tecentriq and Avastin and 55% of people receiving sorafenib. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and fever. These results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 14 May 2020.4 

In May 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for the treatment of people with unresectable or metastatic HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy. In addition, in September, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the approval of Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy. Tecentriq in combination with Avastin was also recently recommended as a preferred option by the CSCO for the treatment of unresectable HCC, as well as by many clinical practice guidelines globally.

Earlier this year, the China NMPA also approved Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) for the first-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), an area of major unmet need and one that has seen limited advances in treatment until now. The submission was based on the results from the positive Phase III IMpower133 study and was the first cancer immunotherapy available in China for the initial treatment of ES-SCLC.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMbrave150 study
IMbrave150 is a global Phase III, multicentre, open-label study of 501 people with unresectable HCC who had not received prior systemic therapy. People were randomised 2:1 to receive the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin or sorafenib. Tecentriq was administered intravenously (IV), 1200 mg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, and Avastin was administered IV, 15 mg/kg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Sorafenib was administered by mouth, 400 mg twice per day, on days 1-21 of each 21-day cycle. People received the combination or the control arm treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The two primary endpoints were OS and independent review facility (IRF)-assessed PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Additional study endpoints included IRF-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and HCC mRECIST.

About hepatocellular carcinoma
HCC, the most common form of liver cancer, is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options and is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide.5 Every year, more than 750,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with HCC,5,6 with the majority of cases in Asia and almost half of all cases in China.1,6 In the US, the number of liver cancer cases have more than tripled since 1980 and HCC represents the fastest-rising cause of cancer-related death, while in Europe, liver cancer is also on the rise.7-9 HCC develops predominantly in people with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis (B or C) or alcohol consumption, and typically presents at an advanced stage.5 The prognosis for unresectable HCC remains poor, with few systemic therapeutic options and a 1-year survival rate of less than 50% following diagnosis.10

About the Tecentriq and Avastin combination
There is a strong scientific rationale to support the use of Tecentriq plus Avastin in combination. The Tecentriq and Avastin regimen may enhance the potential of the immune system to combat a broad range of cancers. Avastin, in addition to its established anti-angiogenic effects, may further enhance Tecentriq’s ability to restore anti-cancer immunity, by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related immunosuppression, promoting T-cell tumour infiltration and enabling priming and activation of T-cell responses against tumour antigens.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, China and a number of other countries, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for a type of liver cancer.

About Avastin
Avastin is a prescription-only medicine that is a solution for intravenous infusion. It is a biologic antibody designed to specifically bind to a protein called VEGF that plays an important role throughout the lifecycle of the tumour to develop and maintain blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Avastin is designed to interfere with the tumour blood supply by directly binding to the VEGF protein to prevent interactions with receptors on blood vessel cells. The tumour blood supply is thought to be critical to a tumour’s ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasise).

51374,AstraZenca Reports Results of Fasenra (benralizumab) in P-lllb PONENTE Trial for Asthma,Fasenra eliminated oral corticosteroid use in a majority of OCS-dependent patients with asthma in PONENTE Phase IIIb trial,"It is based on P-lllb PONENTE trial assessing Fasenra (benralizumab, 30mg) in adult patients with severe Asthma on high-dose ICS + LABA and long-term use of OCS therapy with or without additional asthma controller. This study included approx. 600 patients in EU, North America, South America, and Taiwan
 Results: 62% of patients achieved complete elimination of daily OCS use on 1EP and on the 2EP, 81% of patients achieved complete elimination or were able to reduce their daily OCS dose to 5mg or less when further reduction was not possible due to adrenal insufficiency
 Fasenra is mAb that binds directly to IL-5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis. It is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma and is approved for self-administration in the US, EU and other countries","High-level results from the PONENTE Phase IIIb open-label trial showed Fasenra (benralizumab) eliminated the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) in OCS-dependent asthma patients with a broad range of blood eosinophil counts.

Severe asthma is an often debilitating condition affecting approximately 34 million people worldwide.1,2 More than one-third of these patients currently use chronic or intermittent OCS on top of other therapies to control their symptoms and exacerbations.3,4 However, frequent or chronic OCS use can lead to serious adverse effects.5-7

On the first primary endpoint, 62% of patients achieved complete elimination of daily OCS use. On the second primary endpoint, 81% of patients achieved complete elimination or were able to reduce their daily OCS dose to 5mg or less when further reduction was not possible due to adrenal insufficiency. Both primary endpoints were sustained for at least four weeks while maintaining asthma control. PONENTE included nearly 600 patients in Europe, North America, South America, and Taiwan.

Professor Andrew Menzies-Gow, Director of the Lung Division, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK, the principal investigator of the PONENTE trial, said: “These exciting results demonstrate Fasenra’s impact in eliminating or reducing oral corticosteroid use. The reductions achieved with the personalised oral corticosteroid tapering schedule are particularly important because adrenal insufficiency can be a barrier to safe and meaningful oral corticosteroid reduction. These data should inform severe asthma treatment guidelines and strengthen physicians’ confidence to more safely eliminate chronic oral corticosteroid use in their patients.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Around 13.5 million people worldwide with severe asthma currently rely on oral corticosteroids to control exacerbations and prevent hospitalisations. However, over-reliance on oral corticosteroids can also cause significant health risks for patients, as well as additional strain on health systems. These data further support Fasenra’s clinical profile in eliminating oral corticosteroid use across a broader population of severe asthma patients.”

The trial expands on OCS-sparing data previously seen in the ZONDA Phase III trial by using a faster steroid tapering schedule in patients who did not experience adrenal insufficiency to reduce OCS use from higher doses. The PONENTE trial also has a longer maintenance phase of approximately 24–32 weeks, which shows more durable OCS reduction and asthma control than was shown in ZONDA and all other published trials for biologic medicines.8,9 The safety profile and tolerability of Fasenra in PONENTE were consistent with the known profile of the medicine. The trial results will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

Fasenra is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU, Japan and other countries, and is approved for self-administration in the US, EU and other countries. In January 2020, AstraZeneca announced Fasenra is being evaluated in eight eosinophil-driven diseases beyond severe asthma.

Severe asthma

Asthma affects approximately 339 million individuals worldwide.1,2 Approximately 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, which may be uncontrolled despite high dosages of standard of care asthma controller medicines and can require the long-term use of OCS.2,10,11 Severe, uncontrolled asthma is debilitating and potentially fatal, with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations and significant limitations on lung function and health-related quality of life.2,11,12 Severe, uncontrolled asthma has a greater risk of mortality than severe asthma.10 70% or more of people with severe asthma have elevated counts of eosinophils, white blood cells that are a normal part of the immune system and can drive airway inflammation in some patients.10,11,13,14

Severe, uncontrolled asthma can lead to a dependence on OCS, with cumulative steroid exposure leading to serious short- and long-term adverse effects including weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, glaucoma, anxiety, depression, cardiovascular disease immunosuppression and adrenal insufficiency.5-7 OCS over-reliance can also place additional strain on health systems; a UK analysis identified OCS-dependent asthma patients have an average of 43% greater associated direct healthcare treatment costs than patients not receiving maintenance OCS.15

Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones.16,17 Steroid hormones are important to help control metabolism, inflammation, immune functions and salt and water balance, among other critical functions.17 Adrenal insufficiency can develop as a result of taking chronic OCS and may persist following steroid reduction or discontinuation, potentially causing serious clinical consequences including shock, seizure, coma and even death in cases of an acute adrenal crisis.16,17

PONENTE

PONENTE is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, Phase IIIb trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reducing daily OCS use after initiation of 30 mg dose of Fasenra administered subcutaneously (SC) in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and long-term use of OCS therapy with or without additional asthma controller(s). Patients recruited into the study had been on maintenance OCS dose of ≥5 mg of prednisone for at least three months and had a baseline peripheral blood eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/μL or baseline eosinophils below 150 cells/μL with a documented eosinophil count of ≥300 cells/μL in the past 12 months. The treatment period consisted of a four-week induction phase with no OCS adjustments, a variable OCS tapering phase and an ongoing 24-32-week maintenance phase.8,18

The primary outcome measures of the trial were the proportion of patients achieving a 100% reduction in daily OCS dose and the proportion of patients achieving a 100% reduction or a daily OCS dose of ≤5 mg if the reason for no further OCS reduction was adrenal insufficiency, both sustained for at least four weeks without worsening of asthma.8,18

Compared to published trials, PONENTE has a personalised OCS tapering schedule that allows for more rapid OCS tapering from high OCS doses, followed by an assessment of the adrenal function as part of decision-making to manage the risk of adrenal insufficiency. PONENTE also has a significantly longer maintenance phase, (approximately 24-32 weeks versus four weeks for published trials of other biologics) allowing assessment of the durability of OCS reduction.8,18

Fasenra

Fasenra (benralizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to IL-5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis (programmed cell death).19,20

Fasenra is in development for other eosinophilic diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.21-25 The Food and Drug Administration granted Orphan Drug Designation for Fasenra for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in 2018, and hypereosinophilic syndrome and eosinophilic oesophagitis in 2019.

Fasenra was developed by AstraZeneca and is in-licensed from BioWa, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., Japan.

51381,Sanofi Entered into an Agreement with Merck to Conduct a P-II Study of THOR-707 in Sequenced Administration with MSD's KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in Patients with Various Cancers,Sanofi to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel investigational candidate THOR-707 and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in pursuit of establishing a new treatment option in oncology,"Sanofi will sponsor the clinical trials while MSD will provide KEYTRUDA. Additionally, Sanofi is separately evaluating the activity of THOR-707 in combination with other anti-PD-1 antibodies, including Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) and with anti-EGFR and anti-CD38 antibodies for various types of cancer tumors
 In preclinical studies, THOR-707 demonstrated the ability to induce the expansion of CD8+T-cells resulting in anti-tumor effects both as a single agent as well as in combination with an anti-PD1 mAb
 THOR-707 is currently being evaluated by Sanofi in an ongoing P-I dose escalation and expansion trial assessing THOR-707 and determining its recommended P-II dose alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-EGFR antibodies","PARIS – October 29, 2020 – Sanofi has entered into an agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA (known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada) to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of THOR-707, a highly differentiated non-alpha IL-2 candidate with a best-in-class profile, combined with or in sequenced administration with MSD’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with various cancers.

Under the agreement, Sanofi will sponsor the clinical trials while MSD will provide KEYTRUDA.

“We believe that THOR-707 has the potential to become a foundation of the next generation of immuno-oncology therapies,” said Peter Adamson, Global Head, Oncology Development and Pediatric Innovation, Sanofi. “This collaboration with MSD will enable us to explore whether THOR-707 can increase and expand the effectiveness of KEYTRUDA and improve the outcomes for patients with cancer.”

THOR-707 is currently being evaluated by Sanofi in an ongoing Phase 1 open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion trial. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of THOR-707, and to determine its recommended Phase 2 dose alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-EGFR antibodies.

In addition to testing THOR-707 in combination with KEYTRUDA, Sanofi is separately evaluating the activity of this novel biologic in combination with other anti-PD-1 antibodies, including Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) and with anti-EGFR and anti-CD38 antibodies for various types of cancer tumors.

THOR-707 demonstrated in preclinical studies the ability to induce the expansion of CD8+T-cells resulting in anti-tumor effects both as single agent as well as in combination with an anti-PD1 mAb.

It is the first molecule from the Synthorin platform, Sanofi’s unique expanded genetic alphabet platform, which has the potential to create a new generation of precision medicines for oncology and autoimmune disease.

About THOR-707

THOR-707 has the potential to be a best-in-class IL-2 therapeutic for the treatment of many types of malignancies and may demonstrate improved pharmacology allowing for less frequent dosing. In pre-clinical experiments, THOR-707 shows striking synergy with anti-PD-1 therapeutics.

It is a precisely PEGylated engineered version of interleukin-2 (IL-2), where the PEG chain is attached at a location on IL-2 that prevents it from binding to immune receptors that cause drug toxicities (IL-2R-alpha, CD25) while preserving binding to immune receptors that selectively expand tumor-killing T effector and Natural Killer (NK) cells without the immunosuppressive effects of regulatory T cells or vascular leak syndrome (VLS) inducing eosinophils.

Editor’s Note: As discussed at Sanofi’s R&D Day in June, full Phase 1 results for THOR-707 and the recommended Phase 2 dose are expected by 2021.

51398,AbbVie Reports Results of SKYRIZI (risankizumab) in P-III LIMMitless Study in Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis,New Data Show SKYRIZI [® ]▼ (risankizumab) Maintains Completely Clear Skin for Over Three Years in Nearly Two-Thirds of Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis,"The P-III LIMMitless study is designed to evaluate the long-term safety & efficacy assessing risankizumab (150 mg q12wks.) continuous risankizumab with a loading dose in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The analysis includes integrated data from five P-II & III studies (ultIMMa-1, ultIMMa-2, SustaIMM, IMMvent and NCT03255382) and the LIMMitless study
 Results: ~63% of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated with SKYRIZI achieved completely clear skin for 172 wks., as measured by 100% improvement from baseline in the PASI 100. New results from the P-III LIMMitless study were presented at the 29th EADV Virtual Congress
 Risankizumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. It is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim & AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development & commercialisation globally","MAIDENHEAD, UK, OCTOBER 29, 2020 – AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated with SKYRIZI®▼ achieved completely clear skin for over 3 years (172 weeks), as measured by 100 percent improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100).1 Additionally, after more than 3 years of treatment with risankizumab, 88 percent of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin, as measured by a static Physician’s Global Assessment of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0/1) or a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90).1 No new safety signals were noted through more than 3 years of continuous treatment.1 New results from the Phase 3 open-label extension (OLE) study, LIMMitless, were presented at the 29th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Virtual Congress, October 29-31.
A separate analysis of Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores from the LIMMitless study showed that risankizumab had a substantially positive impact on health-related quality of life.2 DLQI is a measure of a patient’s health-related quality of life, ranging from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating the disease has less impact on life quality.4 After continuous treatment with risankizumab for more than 3 years, the majority of patients (85 percent) achieved a DLQI score of 0 or 1, indicating a significant improvement in quality of life.2 Additionally, after more than 3 years (172 weeks), approximately 91 percent of patients achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in DLQI scores (at least a 4 point reduction from baseline).2 The proportion of patients achieving this reduction remained consistent from one year (week 52; n=873) to over 3 years (week 172; n=505).2

Integrated safety results across psoriasis studies also being presented show that risankizumab’s safety profile remained consistent over the long-term, with no new safety signals identified up to 5.5 years with continuous treatment with SKYRIZI.3 The latest data was from a separate study that evaluated the short-term (16 weeks) and long-term (up to 5.5 years) safety of risankizumab in data pooled from 17 Phase 1-3 studies.3 This analysis was the largest reporting of safety data for risankizumab to date, including more than 3,000 patients with over 7,900 patient years (PY) of exposure from the psoriasis clinical trial programme.3

“Long-term, complete skin clearance is now a realistic treatment goal, and the data being presented at EADV reinforce that,” said Belinda Byrne, AbbVie UK Medical Director. “It is encouraging to see that patients who were continuously treated with risankizumab were able to improve their quality of life over the long-term.”

“People with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis want treatment options that help them achieve and maintain clear skin so they can return to a better quality of life,” said Kim Papp, M.D., Ph.D., founder and president, Probity Medical Research, Waterloo, Ontario. “Alleviating the burden of living with psoriasis is a critical focus for the scientific community. It is wonderful and exciting to see new research showing how risankizumab has helped make this happen.”

Risankizumab is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialisation globally.

About risankizumab in the European Union5

Risankizumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.

Important EU Safety Information5

Risankizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Risankizumab may increase the risk of infection. In patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, or known risk factors for infection, risankizumab should be used with caution. Treatment with risankizumab should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

Prior to initiating treatment with risankizumab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving risankizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating risankizumab in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.

Prior to initiating therapy with risankizumab, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be considered according to current immunisation guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination (viral or bacterial), it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with risankizumab. Patients treated with risankizumab should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory infections, which occurred in 13 percent of patients. Commonly (greater than or equal to 1/100 to less than 1/10) reported adverse reactions included tinea infections, headache, pruritus, fatigue and injection site reactions.

▼Adverse events should be reported. Reporting forms and information can be found at www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard. Adverse events should also be reported to AbbVie on UK_PVVendor@abbvie.com. With biological medicines, healthcare professionals should report adverse reactions by brand name and batch number.

51407,GSK's Zejula (niraparib) Receives EC's Approval as a Treatment in Advanced Ovarian Cancer,European Commission approves Zejula (niraparib) as first-line monotherapy maintenance treatment in advanced ovarian cancer,"The approval is based on PRIMA study assessing Zejula (300mg qd), later amended to incorporate an individualised starting dose of Zejula (200 mg or 300 mg, qd) based on the patient’s baseline weight and/or platelet count
 Results: The PRIMA study improved PFS for patients treated with Zejula, regardless of biomarker status. In the HRd population, Zejula reduced the risk of disease progression or death vs. pbo by 57% and the risk of disease progression or death vs. pbo by 38% in the overall population. Additionally, risk of progression in those with BRCA mutation tumours showed 60% reduction
 Zejula is an oral, once-daily PARP inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in multiple pivotal trials. It is the first PARP inhibitor approved as monotherapy in the EU for patients with platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer","GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) plc today announced the European Commission has approved Zejula (niraparib), an oral, once-daily poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, as first-line monotherapy maintenance treatment for adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response following platinum-based chemotherapy. This approval makes Zejula the only PARP inhibitor approved in the European Union for use as a monotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer, regardless of their biomarker status.

Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “Over 65,000 women in Europe are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year.[i] This approval of Zejula means that many more women will have the option to receive this innovative medicine earlier, potentially extending the time they may spend without their devastating cancer progressing.”

In April 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Zejula in the United States for the same indication, which is supported by data from the pivotal phase 3 PRIMA study (ENGOT-OV26/GOG-3012) that demonstrated a clinically meaningful progression-free survival benefit of Zejula in the first-line maintenance setting. The PRIMA study enrolled patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer who responded to first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, a population with high unmet needs and limited treatment options.

Dr Antonio Gonzalez-Martin, Co-Director, Department of Medical Oncology, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Spain, and Primary Investigator for PRIMA, said: “Until now, only women with BRCA-mutant (BRCAm) ovarian cancer, representing just 20% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer, were eligible to be treated with a PARP inhibitor as monotherapy in the first-line maintenance setting.[ii] Expanding the potential use of Zejula, regardless of biomarker status, is an important step forward in treating this challenging cancer.”

The primary endpoint in the PRIMA study was progression free survival analysed sequentially, first in the homologous recombination deficient (HRd) population, then in the overall population. The PRIMA study significantly improved PFS for patients treated with Zejula, regardless of biomarker status. In the HRd population, Zejula resulted in a 57% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death vs. placebo (HR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.59; p<0.0001) and a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death vs. placebo in the overall population (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.76; p<0.001). In addition, there was a 60% reduction in risk of progression in those with BRCA mutation tumours (HR 0.40; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.62; p<0.001).

Zejula’s safety profile, as demonstrated by the PRIMA results, was consistent with the previously observed clinical safety profile. At initiation of the PRIMA study, patients received a fixed starting dose of 300 mg of Zejula once-daily. The study was later amended to incorporate an individualised starting dose of either 200 mg or 300 mg of Zejula once-daily based on the patient’s baseline weight and/or platelet count. Lower rates of grade 3 and 4 haematologic treatment-emergent adverse events were observed with an individualised starting dose, compared to the overall population, including thrombocytopenia (21% compared to 39%), anaemia (23% compared to 31%) and neutropenia (15% compared to 21%).

Based on these results, the Zejula EU prescribing information has been updated to include the individualised starting dose once-daily based on the patient’s baseline weight and/or platelet count.

Clara MacKay, Chief Executive Officer, World Ovarian Cancer Coalition, said: “Having a new first-line maintenance option for patients with platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer in Europe — regardless of BRCA mutation status — speaks to the important role of PARP inhibitors in the fight against ovarian cancer. We are especially delighted that today’s approval means that more women in Europe who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer will have this new treatment option. We appreciate the commitment and scientific leadership required to develop innovative new therapies that address unmet needs in women’s cancer.”

About Ovarian Cancer

In Europe, ovarian cancer is the sixth deadliest cancer among women[iii] and more than 65,000 women are diagnosed each year.i Despite high response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line, approximately 85% of women with advanced ovarian cancer will see their disease return.[iv] With each recurrence, the time a woman may spend without her cancer progressing gets shorter.

About Zejula (niraparib)

Niraparib is an oral, once-daily PARP inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in multiple pivotal trials. GSK is building a robust niraparib clinical development programme by assessing activity across multiple tumour types and by evaluating several potential combinations of niraparib with other therapeutics. The ongoing development programme for niraparib includes several combination studies.

GSK in Oncology

GSK is focused on maximising patient survival through transformational medicines. GSK’s pipeline is focused on immuno-oncology, cell therapy, cancer epigenetics and synthetic lethality. Our goal is to achieve a sustainable flow of new treatments based on a diversified portfolio of investigational medicines utilising modalities such as small molecules, antibodies, antibody drug conjugates and cell therapy, either alone or in combination.

Important Information for ZEJULA

Zejula approved indication:

Zejula is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

Important Safety Information

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to niraparib or to any of the excipients and breast-feeding.

Warnings and precautions: Test complete blood counts (CBC) weekly for the first month of treatment, followed by monthly monitoring for the next 10 months of treatment and periodically after this time. This is recommended to monitor for clinically significant changes in any haematologic parameter during treatment. If a patient develops severe persistent haematologic toxicity (thrombocytopenia, anaemia and neutropenia including pancytopenia) that does not resolve within 28 days following interruption, Zejula should be discontinued. Patients with lower body weight or lower baseline platelet count may be at increased risk of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia. Due to the risk of thrombocytopenia, anticoagulants and medicinal products known to reduce the thrombocyte count should be used with caution. If MDS and/or AML are confirmed while being prescribed Zejula, treatment should be discontinued, and the patient treated appropriately. Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported with the use of Zejula. Pre‑existing hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting Zejula treatment. Zejula should be discontinued in case of hypertensive crisis or if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately controlled with antihypertensive therapy. There have been reports of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) in patients receiving Zejula. In case of PRES, it is recommended to discontinue treatment. Patients with galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. Tartrazine may cause allergic reactions. Paediatric safety and efficacy has not yet been established.

Undesirable effects: The most common serious adverse reactions were thrombocytopenia and anaemia.

Very common (≥1/10): anaemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, fatigue, constipation, vomiting, headache, insomnia, platelet count decreased, neutropenia, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, hypertension, asthenia, dizziness, neutrophil count decreased, cough, arthralgia, back pain, white blood cell count decreased, and hot flush.

Common (≥1/1000 to <1/10): bronchitis, conjunctivitis, leukopenia, hypersensitivity, hypokalemia, anxiety, depression, dysgeusia, tachycardia, hypertension, epistaxis, dry mouth, abdominal distension, mucosal inflammation (including mucositis), stomatitis, photosensitivity, rash, myalgia, oedema peripheral, fatigue, asthenia, Gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, AST increased, blood creatinine increased, ALT increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased and weight decreased.

51446,UCB Reports Results of Bimekizumab in P-III BE SURE Study for Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis,Bimekizumab Phase 3 Data Shows Superior Skin Clearance Over Humira® in Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis Patients,"The P-III BE SURE study involves assessing bimekizumab vs Humira (adalimumab) for 24wks. is followed until 56wks. in 478 adult patients with chronic PsO for at least 6 mos. before screening & with an affected body surface area of at least 10%, PASI of at least 12 & IGA score equal to or > 3 on a 5point scale
 Results: The study met its 1EPs & 2EPs, @16wks. PASI 90 (86.2% vs 47.2%); IGA 0/1 (85.3 % vs 57.2%); PASI 100 (60.8% vs 23.9%); PASI 100 @24wks. (66.8% vs 29.6%); PASI 90, PASI 100 and IGA 0/1 response rates were maintained through 1year with both q4w & q8w; skin clearance rates increased in patients who switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab @24wks., with response rates @56wks. comparable to patients treated with bimekizumab throughout the study
 Bimekizumab is an investigational humanized IgG1 mAb that selectively inhibits both IL-17A & IL-17F","BRUSSELS, Oct. 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — UCB, a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced the detailed results of the head-to-head Phase 3 BE SURE study, which demonstrated that patients treated with investigational IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor bimekizumab achieved superior skin clearance, as compared to adalimumab, in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.1 These findings were presented for the first time as an oral presentation at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress, taking place virtually between October 29-31, 2020.

BE SURE met all primary and secondary ranked endpoints.1 The co-primary endpoints were at least a 90 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clear or almost clear (IGA 0/1) versus adalimumab at week 16. Secondary endpoints included PASI 90 and IGA 0/1 at weeks 24 and 56, and PASI 100 at weeks 16 and 24.

In BE SURE, patients treated with bimekizumab achieved significantly higher PASI 90, IGA 0/1 and PASI 100 skin clearance rates compared to patients treated with adalimumab at week 16.1 In patients that started bimekizumab at baseline, response rates were maintained up to a year. Rapid increases in skin clearance rates were seen in patients who switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab at week 24.1 The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab have not been established, and it is not approved by any regulatory authority worldwide.

“In BE SURE, we saw significantly higher skin clearance rates with bimekizumab compared with one of the most commonly used biologic treatments in psoriasis. The study results also demonstrated the potential benefits of switching patients who are being treated with adalimumab to bimekizumab,” said study investigator, Professor Richard Warren, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust and The University of Manchester, United Kingdom.

“These findings from BE SURE, the third positive study in the psoriasis clinical development program, are further evidence of bimekizumab’s superior depth of response. The results also add to the mounting evidence supporting the potential value of selective inhibition of IL-17F, in addition to IL-17A, for rapid, complete and durable skin clearance, if approved by health authorities. UCB is proud to be developing innovative solutions for psoriasis patients,” said Emmanuel Caeymaex, Executive Vice President Immunology Solutions and Head of US, UCB.

In BE SURE, 86.2 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved almost clear skin (PASI 90), compared with 47.2 percent of patients treated with adalimumab at week 16 (p<0.001).1 Additionally, 85.3 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved IGA 0/1, versus 57.2 percent of patients treated with adalimumab at week 16 (p<0.001).1 Significantly more patients treated with bimekizumab achieved complete skin clearance (PASI 100) than those treated with adalimumab: 60.8 percent versus 23.9 percent at week 16, and 66.8 percent versus 29.6 percent at week 24 (p<0.001 for each comparison).1

In the two bimekizumab study arms, PASI 90, PASI 100 and IGA 0/1 response rates were maintained through to week 56.1 These results were observed across both dosing regimens: bimekizumab every four weeks (Q4W dosing) until week 56, or Q4W dosing for 16 weeks, followed by bimekizumab every eight weeks (Q8W dosing) from week 16 to week 56.1 In patients treated with adalimumab, response rates for PASI 90, PASI 100 and IGA 0/1 rapidly increased after patients were switched to bimekizumab Q4W dosing at week 24, through to week 56.1 At week 56, response rates in switched patients were comparable to those who had been treated with bimekizumab throughout the study.1

Through weeks 0–24, the active comparator period, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs were comparable for patients receiving bimekizumab (71.5 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively) and adalimumab (69.8 percent and 3.1 percent).1 Through weeks 0–56, 81.4 percent and 5.1 percent of patients receiving bimekizumab (including those who switched from adalimumab) experienced TEAEs and serious TEAEs, respectively.1 The most common TEAEs that were observed for bimekizumab through weeks 0–56 were nasopharyngitis (20.9 percent), oral candidiasis (16.2 percent) and upper respiratory tract infection (9.0 percent).1 Through week 56, there were no suicidal ideation/behavior, inflammatory bowel disease, or major adverse cardiac events reported in patients treated with bimekizumab.1

About BE SURE 
BE SURE is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab to adalimumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The active-controlled initial treatment period of 24 weeks is followed by a dose-blind maintenance treatment period until week 56. BE SURE enrolled 478 participants with chronic plaque psoriasis for at least six months prior to screening and with an affected body surface area of at least 10 percent, PASI of at least 12 and IGA score equal to or greater than three on a five-point scale.2

The co-primary endpoints of the study were PASI 90 response (defined as a patient who achieves a 90 percent improvement in PASI) and IGA response (defined as clear or almost clear with at least a two-category improvement relative to baseline) at week 16.

About Bimekizumab
Bimekizumab is an investigational humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits both IL-17A and IL-17F, two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.3 IL-17F has overlapping biology with IL-17A and drives inflammation independently to IL-17A.4,5,6,7,8 Selective inhibition of IL-17F in addition to IL-17A suppresses inflammation to a greater extent than IL-17A inhibition alone.7,8 The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab are being evaluated across multiple disease states as part of a robust clinical program.

About Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory disease with primary involvement of the skin. This skin condition affects men and women of all ages and ethnicities.9 Psoriasis signs and symptoms can vary but may include red patches of skin covered with silvery scales; dry, cracked skin that may bleed; and thickened, pitted or ridged nails.10

Psoriasis affects nearly three percent of the population, or about 125 million people worldwide.6 Unmet needs remain in the treatment of psoriasis. A population-based survey identified that approximately 30 percent of psoriasis patients reported that their primary goals of therapy, including keeping symptoms under control, reducing itching and decreasing flaking, were not met with their current treatment.11 Psoriasis has a considerable psychological and quality of life impact, potentially affecting work, recreation, relationships, sexual functioning, family and social life.12

Forward looking statements UCB
This press release may contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “seeks”, “estimates”, “may”, “will”, “continue” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and beliefs of management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial information, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements of UCB, or industry results, to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19, changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’ efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also, UCB or others could discover safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover, sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, including pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally, a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of UCB’s data and systems.

Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market, or at any particular time, nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.

UCB is providing this information, including forward-looking statements, only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release, either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

Additionally, information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

 Regeneron shared the update with the trial’s IDMC and regulatory authorities and will conduct a review of the study to better understand the benefit/risk profile of garetosmab in people with FOP
 Garetosmab is a VelocImmune-derived mAb that binds and neutralizes Activin A, which is involved in the development of heterotopic bone in people with FOP","Regeneron today notified clinical investigators to pause dosing of the investigational therapy
garetosmab (REGN2477) in the ongoing Phase 2 LUMINA-1 trial in patients with the ultra-rare
genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). The decision was based on
reports of fatal serious adverse events in the trial during the open-label extension, during
which all patients received active treatment. These deaths are being further investigated to
understand if they are related to garetosmab treatment. During the 28-week double-blind
treatment period, there were no deaths in the trial.
Regeneron also shared this update with the trial’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee
and regulatory authorities, and will conduct a review of the trial data to date, to better
understand the benefit/risk profile of garetosmab in people with FOP. Regeneron announced
topline 28-week results from the 44-patient LUMINA-1 trial earlier this year; this is the only
active trial evaluating garetosmab.
About Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP)
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a relentless, progressive, ultra-rare genetic
disorder in which muscles, tendons and ligaments are progressively replaced by bone, a
process known as heterotopic ossification (HO). There are believe to be approximately 900
patients diagnosed with FOP worldwide. HO of the jaw, spine, hip and rib cage can make it
difficult to speak, eat, walk or breathe, leading to weight loss and escalating loss of mobility
and skeletal deformity. Most people with FOP are wheelchair bound by 30 years old and the
median age of survival is approximately 56 years. Death often results from complications, such
as pneumonia, heart failure and aspiration stemming from HO and loss of mobility in the chest,
neck and jaw.

51464,Medtronic Expands ENT Portfolio with the Acquisition of Ai Biomed and the Approval of NIM Vital Nerve Monitoring System,Medtronic Expands ENT Portfolio with FDA Clearance of NIM Vital™ Next Generation Intraoperative Nerve Monitoring System and Acquisiton of Ai Biomed Corp.,"Medtronic has expanded its portfolio of technologies focusing on improving the safety of head and neck surgeries with the acquisition of Ai Biomed and the US FDA’s 510(k) clearance of NIM Vital nerve monitoring system
 The NIM Vital nerve monitoring system enables physicians to identify, confirm, and monitor nerve function to help reduce the risk of nerve damage during head and neck surgery
 The acquisition marks the 7th acquisition by Medtronic in 2020. The acquisition will add the PTeye laser system to Medtronic’s ENT portfolio which a tissue-detecting probe used in thyroid surgery","DUBLIN, Oct. 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance of the NIM Vital™ nerve monitoring system, which enables physicians to identify, confirm, and monitor nerve function to help reduce the risk of nerve damage during head and neck surgery.1 The NIM Vital system uses proprietary technology to provide detailed intraoperative nerve condition data that informs surgical strategy,2 increases operative efficiency and precision,3 and helps protect patients’ quality of life.4

The company also announced further enhancement of its ENT portfolio with the recent acquisition of privately-held Ai Biomed Corp., maker of the PTeye™ parathyroid detection system. The only probe-based technology of its kind,5 the PTeye system is designed to help confirm parathyroid tissue identified visually by the physician during thyroid surgery.

“Protecting critical structures during surgery has evolved to an extensive system that brings crucial information to the surgeon’s hands and eyes,” said Gregory Randolph, M.D., professor of Otolaryngology, Claire and John Bertucci endowed chair in Thyroid Surgical Oncology at Harvard Medical School and surgeon at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. “There are things we can’t do with our eyes and our hands. Both the NIM Vital and PTeye systems empower surgeons to improve their procedures, and Medtronic continues to provide these types of important operative solutions.”

“The addition of these two technologies builds on our 20-year legacy of providing innovative solutions that assist surgeons during critical head and neck procedures,” said Vince Racano, vice president and general manager of the ENT business, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group at Medtronic. “By offering these complementary technologies – the NIM Vital system to protect crucial nerves and the PTeye system to help confirm parathyroid tissue identified visually by the surgeon – we’re helping physicians address two of the most common challenges during these procedures.”

About the NIM Vital Intraoperative Nerve Monitoring System
Even with detailed knowledge of anatomy and surgical skill, motor nerves can sometimes be difficult to identify during surgery due to disease, a previous operation, or normal anatomical variations.6,7 Clinical evidence demonstrates the benefits of intraoperative nerve monitoring for nerve preservation and as a risk-minimizing tool.2,3,8

The NIM Vital system enables surgeons to locate and identify nerves, monitor and control manipulation effects, and confirm nerve integrity prior to completing the surgery. Proprietary technology provides real-time feedback on nerve function during intermittent or continuous monitoring so surgeons can adjust course as needed. A large touch-screen and streamlined interface provide an intuitive, guided workflow with enhanced visualization.9 Now available in the United States, the NIM Vital system is also CE marked for distribution outside the U.S.

About the Ai Biomed Corp. Acquisition and the PTeye System
The acquisition of Ai Biomed Corp. expands upon intraoperative technology like the NIM Vital platform and supports the Medtronic goal of using innovative technologies to improve head and neck surgery. The PTeye system helps confirm parathyroid tissue identified visually by the physician, which is a crucial step in thyroid surgery.

The most common type of thyroid surgery involves partial or full removal of the thyroid glands. During thyroid procedures, it is important for surgeons to identify and preserve parathyroid tissue so that it is not inadvertently removed, which may result in hypocalcemia, or low calcium levels. Hypocalcemia can cause numbness in fingers and toes, muscle cramps in legs and feet, irritability, and seizures.10

The acquisition of Ai Biomed Corp. is the seventh in a series of tuck-in acquisitions that Medtronic has made in calendar year 2020. The revenue and earnings contribution is expected to be immaterial to the Medtronic ENT business in the first year and accretive thereafter. In addition, this transaction is expected to meet Medtronic’s long-term financial metrics for acquisitions. Additional terms of the agreement are not being disclosed. The Ai Biomed Corp. facility in Santa Barbara, Calif., and its employees joined Medtronic ENT as part of the acquisition.

51471,Sun Pharma Reports Five Year Results of Ilumya (tildrakizumab-asmn) in P-III Studies for Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis,Sun Pharma Announces 5-Year Sustained Efficacy and Safety Results for ILUMYA® (tildrakizumab-asmn) in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis,"The P-III extension studies (reSURFACE 1 & reSURFACE 2) involves assessing Ilumya (100 & 200mg) vs PBO in moderate-to-severe PsO participants with at least 50% improvement in PASI 50 at base study completion who received Ilumya within 12wks. of base study end (52 or 64wks.) were eligible to enroll in the extension study & continued on the same Ilumya dose vs PBO (q12w)
 Results: Ilumya (100 mg) @244wks., PASI 90 & PASI 100 (65.9% & 32.8%); PASI75 (88.7%). In long-term analyses, absolute PASI <1/<3/<5 scores @28wks. (50.8%, 85.1% & 96.4%, respectively) were sustained @244wks. (47.7%, 78.8% & 88.7%) respectively. Additional data results presented provide insight into the positive long-term safety profile for Ilumya in five year
 Ilumya is a humanized lgG1/k mAb, targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23 & inhibit its interaction with the IL-23 receptor and is approved in Australia, Japan & EU for PsO","MUMBAI, India and PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Reuters: SUN.BO, Bloomberg: SUNP IN, NSE: SUNPHARMA, BSE: 524715, “Sun Pharma” including its subsidiaries and/or associate companies) today announced that one of its wholly owned subsidiaries presented positive, five-year Phase 3 data for ILUMYA® (tildrakizumab-asmn) from the combined reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 extension studies. Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who continued to receive ILUMYA through five years of continuous treatment maintained consistent and extensive skin clearance with no new safety issues reported.1 These data were presented for the first time at the 29th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Virtual Congress.

“These results are important as we now have five-year data reinforcing our understanding that ILUMYA may provide patients with sustained skin clearance and a well understood safety profile that was comparable to placebo,” said Richard Langley, M.D., FRCPC, professor of medicine and director of research, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University. “ILUMYA is a valued option for patients in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and these findings are reassuring for physicians and their patients living with this chronic disease.”

In an analysis of the pooled reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 extension studies, patients received ILUMYA 100 mg or 200 mg through five years of continuous treatment. ILUMYA 100 mg is approved in the U.S., Japan and Australia, and 200 mg is additionally approved under the brand name ILUMETRI™ in Europe. In patients who were treated with ILUMYA 100 mg, clear or almost clear skin (PASI 90) was achieved by 65.9% of patients and 32.8% of patients achieved completely clear skin (PASI 100) at Week 244. The standard goal of treatment, a PASI 75 response, was achieved by 88.7% of patients at Week 244.1 The long-term analyses also showed absolute PASI <1/<3/<5 scores at Week 28 (50.8%, 85.1% and 96.4%, respectively) were sustained through Week 244 (47.7%, 78.8% and 88.7%, respectively).1 Absolute PASI scores can provide an indication of the extent of residual disease after treatment. Achievement of an absolute PASI score of <3 has been proposed as comparable to a PASI 90 response, which is equivalent to clear or almost clear skin.3

ILUMYA 100 mg was well-tolerated during the Phase 3 trials. The three adverse reactions that occurred more frequently than placebo and ≥1% in clinical trials were upper respiratory infections (14% vs. 12%), injection site reactions (3% vs. 2%) and diarrhea (2% vs. 1%). Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated similar exposure-adjusted incidence rates of malignancies throughout five years of study. A majority of malignancies were singular events with similar incidence rates as seen in the general US population.2

“These impressive results show that ILUMYA keeps working year-on-year, maintaining a high level of skin clearance and a durable safety profile regardless of baseline level of skin disease, age or background illnesses,” said Abhay Gandhi, CEO, Sun Pharma, North America. “Patients living with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis need therapies they can use over long periods of time without loss of efficacy, and we are pleased these data show that ILUMYA is a sustainable choice for patients over the long term.”

ILUMYA is approved for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and is being evaluated for other possible uses. See ongoing studies below for more information.

About the reSURFACE Extension Studies

The Phase 3 studies (reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2) were randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, three-part studies designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of ILUMYA 100 mg and 200 mg in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis compared to placebo and comparative drug and to assess safety and tolerability. Participants with at least 50 percent improvement in PASI 50 at base study completion who received ILUMYA within 12 weeks of base study end (week 52 or 64) were eligible to enroll in the extension study and continued on the same ILUMYA dose or placebo once every 12 weeks. Researchers evaluated PASI and PGA response (score of 0 or 1 with ≥2 grade reduction from baseline) and incidence rates for prespecified adverse events, including severe infections, cardiovascular events and drug-related hypersensitivities.

About ILUMYA (tildrakizumab-asmn)

ILUMYA (tildrakizumab-asmn) is a humanized lgG1/k monoclonal antibody designed to selectively bind to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23 (IL-23) and inhibit its interaction with the IL-23 receptor, leading to inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. ILUMYA is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, in the United States. ILUMYA has also been approved for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in Australia and Japan, and under the brand name ILUMETRI in Europe.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

ILUMYA is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tildrakizumab or to any other excipients.

Cases of angioedema and urticaria occurred in ILUMYA-treated subjects in clinical trial. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ILUMYA immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.

ILUMYA may increase the risk of infection. Treatment with ILUMYA should not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to prescribing ILUMYA in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Instruct patients receiving ILUMYA to seek medical help if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important or serious infection, or is not responding to standard therapy, closely monitor and discontinue ILUMYA until the infection resolves.

Evaluate patients for TB infection prior to initiating treatment with ILUMYA. Do not administer ILUMYA to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering ILUMYA. Consider antiTB therapy prior to initiation of ILUMYA in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving ILUMYA should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after ILUMYA treatment.

Prior to initiating therapy with ILUMYA, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Patients treated with ILUMYA should not receive live vaccines.

Most common (≥1%) adverse reactions associated with ILUMYA include upper respiratory infections, injection site reactions, and diarrhea. Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% but greater than 0.1% in the ILUMYA group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group included dizziness and pain in extremity.

51480,Novartis Reports Results of Aimovig (erenumab) in P-lV Study for Episodic and Chronic Migraine,Novartis announces positive results from a Phase IV study showing superior tolerability and efficacy of Aimovig® (erenumab) compared with topiramate in migraine prevention,"The P-IV HER-MES study involves assessing Aimovig (erenumab 70mg and 140mg) vs topiramate in 777 patients in a ratio (1:1) with episodic or chronic migraine (≥4 migraine days/month) prior not treated with migraine prevention treatment or previously failed up to three prophylactic migraine treatments
 The study met its 1EPs & 2EPs and had superior tolerability against topiramate, with a higher proportion of patients remaining on Aimovig than on topiramate. The therapy showed superior efficacy, with a greater proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in their MMDs
 Aimovig is the first EMA, Swissmedic, and US FDA’s approved migraine prevention treatment designed to target CGRP-R","Basel, November 2, 2020 — Novartis announced today that HER-MES, the first Phase IV, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, head-to-head study of Aimovig® (erenumab) against topiramate, an anticonvulsant, in patients with episodic and chronic migraine met its primary and secondary endpoints. The results of HER-MES showed that Aimovig had a superior tolerability and efficacy profile than topiramate, with less discontinuation over the course of the 24-week treatment phase. Aimovig also showed superior efficacy, with a greater proportion of patients achieving at least 50% reduction in their monthly migraine days (MMDs).

“The data generated by this first of a kind head-to-head study reinforces the value of erenumab as a safe and effective migraine prevention treatment. The findings also provide novel insights into migraine therapy for physicians and patients,” said Prof. Uwe Reuter, Managing Medical Director at Charité Universitätsmedizin.

“With Aimovig continuing to be the anti-CGRP treatment with the longest safety and efficacy experience, these results further emphasize its potential to provide significant relief from migraine with an infrequent dosing compared with the oral treatment,” said Estelle Vester-Blokland, Global Head Neuroscience Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Novartis remains fiercely committed to reimagining migraine care worldwide, contributing to the improvement of life for people living with this highly debilitating neurological disease.”

HER-MES aimed to determine the tolerability and efficacy of Aimovig 70 mg and 140 mg compared with topiramate, an anticonvulsant commonly used as standard of care in migraine prevention, in the highest tolerated dose (50-100 mg daily). The study enrolled 777 adult patients suffering from ≥ 4 MMDs and who were naïve to, not suitable for or had previously failed up to three prophylactic migraine treatments.

The primary outcome of HER-MES explored the Aimovig treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events compared with topiramate during the double-blind treatment phase of the study. Overall, Aimovig showed superior tolerability against topiramate, with a higher proportion of patients remaining on Aimovig than on topiramate.

The secondary endpoint looked into the superiority of Aimovig compared with topiramate in terms of at least 50% reduction in MMDs to baseline in the last three months of the 24-week, double-blind treatment phase. A higher number of patients in the Aimovig treatment arm experienced a significant (≥50%) reduction in MMDs compared with those on topiramate treatment arm. The safety profile in the HER-MES study was generally consistent with those seen in previous Aimovig clinical trials.

Additional findings and detailed results of primary and secondary endpoints from this trial will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress.

Migraine is a highly debilitating disease that has a significant impact on people’s lives, including time spent with family and friends, or at work2,3. Aimovig is the first European Medicines Agency (EMA), Swissmedic, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved migraine preventive treatment that targets the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R). It is self-administered once monthly via the SureClick® autoinjector, does not require a loading dose and is easy to use4.

Aimovig is the only CGRP-R inhibitor with up to 5-year clinical trial data in episodic and chronic migraine, adding to the breadth of data showcasing the expanded long-term safety and efficacy of the treatment for migraine patients.

About HER-MES
HER-MES (NCT03828539) is a two-armed, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, Phase IV study to assess the tolerability and efficacy of Aimovig® (erenumab) versus topiramate in a patient-centered setting5. The primary endpoint was treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events compared with topiramate during the double-blind treatment phase of the study5. The secondary endpoint was efficacy of 70 mg and 140 mg erenumab versus topiramate in terms of at least 50% reduction in monthly migraine days to baseline in the last three months (months 4, 5 and 6) of the double-blind, 24-week treatment phase5 in the highest tolerated dose (50-100 mg daily). The HER-MES study enrolled 777 adult patients with episodic or chronic migraine (≥4 migraine days per month) who had not previously received migraine prevention treatment or had unsuccessfully discontinued up to three previous therapies with propranolol/metoprolol, amitriptyline and flunarizine5. After a 2-week screening and 4-week baseline phase, patients were randomized 1:1 to erenumab or topiramate. In the double-blind, 24-week treatment phase, patients in the erenumab arm received either 70 mg or 140 mg directly after the baseline phase according to the current expert information, as estimated by the investigator5. An increase in dose from 70 mg to 140 mg was possible at any time during the study. Patients in the topiramate arm were given topiramate at the highest tolerated dose (50-100 mg), starting with a 6-week titration phase, according to the latest expert information5. The HER-MES study has been fully developed in Germany. The study was conducted in 82 centers from the end of February 2019 to the end of July 2020.

About Aimovig® (erenumab)
Aimovig is the first European Medicines Agency (EMA), Swissmedic, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved migraine prevention treatment designed specifically to block the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R), which plays a critical role in migraine. Aimovig has been studied in several large, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to assess its safety and efficacy in migraine prevention. More than 3,000 patients have participated in our overall clinical trial program. This includes 2,600 participants across the four placebo-controlled pivotal Phase II and Phase III clinical studies as well as participants in further studies such as LIBERTY, a dedicated study in a difficult-to-treat treatment failure population. The most common side effects in the clinical program to date have been viral upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, influenza, and back pain. Aimovig is the most prescribed anti-CGRP worldwide, with more than 480,000 patients prescribed in the post-trial setting.

Migraine is a distinct neurological disease6. It involves recurrent attacks of moderate-to-severe head pain that is typically pulsating, often unilateral and associated with nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light, sound and odors7. Migraine is associated with personal pain, disability, reduced quality of life and financial cost to society8. It has a profound and limiting impact on an individual’s abilities to carry out everyday tasks; the World Health Organization reported migraine to be one of the top 10 causes of years lived with disability for men and women8,9. It remains under-recognized and under-treated8,10.

51486,Sanofi to Acquire Kiadis for ~$358M,"Sanofi offers to acquire Kiadis, a clinical-stage company developing cell-based immunotherapy products","Sanofi to acquire all outstanding shares of Kiadis for $6.34/ share, representing an equity value of $358.76M. The offer price represents a premium of 272% over the closing price on Oct 30, 2020, a premium of ~247% over the 30 trading days VWAP and a premium of ~200% over the 90 trading days VWAP
 The transaction is expected to be completed in H1’21. The addition of Kiadis’ NK cell platform and pipeline of cell-based cancer immune-therapeutics & infectious disease therapies complements Sanofi’s existing therapeutic expertise
 In July’2020, Sanofi licensed Kiadis’ pre-clinical K-NK004 program for MM. Sanofi’s infrastructure and capabilities will be leveraged to advance the development of Kiadis’ pipeline","PARIS and AMSTERDAM – November 2, 2020 – Sanofi and Kiadis, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative ‘off the shelf’ natural killer (NK) cell based medicines for the treatment of life-threatening diseases, entered into a definitive agreement under which Sanofi will make a public offer (subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions) to acquire the entire share capital of Kiadis for EUR 5.45 per share, representing an aggregate adjusted equity value of €308m1.

“We believe the Kiadis ‘off the shelf’ K-NK cell technology platform will have broad application against liquid and solid tumors, and create synergies with Sanofi’s emerging immuno-oncology pipeline, providing opportunities for us to pursue potential best-in-disease approaches,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research & Development at Sanofi.

“Kiadis’ vision is to bring novel cell-based medicines to people with life-threatening diseases, and this transaction will help achieve that vision,” said Arthur Lahr, Chief Executive Officer of Kiadis. “After the discontinuation of our lead product candidate and subsequent reorganization in 2019, we restarted Kiadis in 2020 as an entirely new company focused solely on the proprietary and differentiated NK-cell platform that we obtained through the acquisition of Cytosen Therapeutics. Sanofi’s offer is a clear testimony to the uniqueness of our NK-cell platform and the rapid success of Kiadis’ transformation. The Kiadis Boards unanimously believe that Sanofi has the resources and financial strength to accelerate development of our NK-cell products, to the benefit of patients. We believe this transaction represents compelling value to shareholders and offers a fair reflection of the potential of our platform and pipeline, given the risk/reward profile typical to biotech and the capital required to execute our business plan. Finally, this transaction will provide excellent career opportunities for our employees, who will be viewed by Sanofi as their internal cell-therapy experts.”

Innovative K-NK cell platform

Kiadis’ proprietary platform is based on allogeneic or ‘off-the-shelf’ NK cells from a healthy donor. NK cells seek and identify malignant cancer cells and have broad application across various tumor types. The platform has the potential to make products rapidly and economically available for a broad patient population across a wide range of indications.

Kiadis’ NK cell-based medicines will be developed alone and in combination with Sanofi’s existing platforms.

Complementary strong science to generate first-in-class medicines and strategic fit across core therapeutic areas

Sanofi’s research, development, and commercial expertise will be leveraged to advance Kiadis’ pipeline, which includes NK cell based medicines for the treatment of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, liquid and solid tumors, as well as infectious disease.

In July 2020, Sanofi licensed Kiadis’ pre-clinical K-NK004 program for potential combination for multiple myeloma.

Kiadis’ pipeline of NK cell therapies includes:

K-NK002 is in a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating NK cells to prevent post-transplant relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes. The Phase 2 trial will be conducted in collaboration with premier U.S. transplant centers.

K-NK003 is a Phase 1 study evaluating NK cells for patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

KNK-ID-101 is a program evaluating the properties of K-NK cells and their suitability to fight SARS-CoV-2 and the option to develop K-NK cells as a post-exposure pre-emptive therapy for COVID-19 in high risk patients. Kiadis plans to initiate a phase 1/2a clinical trial evaluating use of K-NK cells to treat COVID-19 patients with government grant funding.

Accelerates the clinical development and broadens patient reach of current Kiadis pipeline

Subject to the completion of the public offer, Sanofi will provide the resources and capabilities necessary to accelerate the development of current Kiadis programs for the treatment of blood tumors, solid cancers, and infectious diseases, maximizing their potential to the benefit of patients.

 Results demonstrated non-inferior efficacy of PP6M to PP3M on the 1EPs of time to relapse at the end of the 12mos. period in both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis sets, the safety profile is consistent with no new safety signals
 If approved, PP6M will be the first and only long-acting injectable schizophrenia treatment with a twice-yearly dosing regimen. Additionally, Janssen plans to submit an MAA extension to the EMA for PP6M in the coming months","TITUSVILLE, N.J., Nov. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) today announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for paliperidone palmitate 6-month (PP6M) for the treatment of adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. If approved, PP6M will be the first and only long-acting injectable (LAI) schizophrenia medication with a twice-yearly dosing regimen.

“Janssen’s roots in neuroscience began with research and development of novel therapeutic options for schizophrenia, and this filing builds on that 60-year commitment,” said Bill Martin, Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Neuroscience, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We designed this unique dosing regimen so people with schizophrenia and their healthcare teams can focus less on medication intervals and more on other aspects of their treatment plans, such as psychosocial interventions. We look forward to working with the FDA to add a 6-month formulation to our family of paliperidone palmitate products.”

The submission is based on the Route 6 Study, a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority Phase 3 global study that enrolled 702 adults living with schizophrenia from 20 countries. Data showed non-inferior efficacy of PP6M compared to paliperidone palmitate 3-month (PP3M) on the primary endpoint of time to relapse at the end of the 12-month period in both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis sets.1 The safety profile observed for PP6M was consistent with previous studies of paliperidone palmitate 1-month (PP1M) and 3-month (PP3M) formulations with no new safety signals emerging.

“Antipsychotic medication plays an important role in schizophrenia symptom control; however, nonadherence to prescribed medicines has been recognized as a problem worldwide,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Addressing this challenging aspect of treatment has been the catalyst for our research and development of long-acting injectable medications for people living with schizophrenia.”

PP6M is intended to be used only after patients have been stabilized on a shorter acting formulation of paliperidone palmitate (PP1M or PP3M), with the goal of administering fewer injections. The Janssen U.S. portfolio of LAI medicines currently approved to treat adults with schizophrenia includes RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone 2-weekly)2, INVEGA SUSTENNA®3 and INVEGA TRINZA®4 (PP1M and PP3M formulations, respectively), all of which are administered in a clinical setting by a medical professional.

Janssen plans to submit a Marketing Authorization Application extension to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for PP6M in the coming months.

About the Route 6 Trial
The Route 6 Study was a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority global Phase 3 study of 702 adults with schizophrenia, designed to demonstrate that injection of PP6M is not less effective than PP3M for the prevention of relapse in participants previously stabilized on corresponding doses of PP1M or PP3M.

The study consisted of three phases: a screening phase (up to 28 days), a maintenance phase (of 1 or 3 months), and a double-blind phase (of 12 months). Additional/conditional phases included a transition phase and maintenance phase. The maintenance phase was used to stabilize patients on PP1M or PP3M prior to the double-blind phase. Study evaluations included efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety. The study’s duration varied from approximately 13 months to 19 months.

About Long-Acting Injectables
Long-acting injectables (LAIs) allow for the slow release of medicine into the blood and have been available for more than 50 years.5 LAI antipsychotics offer a number of advantages compared with oral medication, including not having to remember to take drugs daily, improved patient outcomes, improved patient and physician satisfaction, and lower relapse rates.6 Based on clinical guidance developed by the American Association of Community Psychiatrists and research evidence from the National Institute for Mental Health and others, the National Council of Behavioral Health recommends LAIs as a first-line treatment to eligible patients.7

About Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe brain disorder affecting approximately 20 million people worldwide8 and an estimated 2.8 million people in the U.S.9,10 The disease is characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self and behavior leading to neurological impairment and severe disability.8

Antipsychotic medication is recognized as an essential component in the treatment of schizophrenia, and adherence to medication plays a critical role in preventing symptoms and costly relapses.11 However, nearly 75 percent of patients with schizophrenia experience a relapse, often driven by non-adherence to prescribed medication.12,13

51515,Tetra Therapeutics Reports Positive Results of BPN14770 in P-II Study for Fragile X Syndrome,Tetra Therapeutics Announces Positive Topline Results from Phase 2 Study of BPN14770 in Patients with Fragile X Syndrome,"The P-II study is a two-way crossover study assessing BPN14770 (25mg, bid) vs PBO in 30 adult male patients aged 18-45yrs. with FXS due to >200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene
 The study demonstrated benefits in oral reading recognition (+2.80), picture vocabulary (+5.79), cognition crystallized composite score (+5.29), benefits were maintained up to 12wks. and was well tolerated
 BPN14770 is a novel therapy that selectively inhibits PDE4D to increase the levels of cAMP. In preclinical trials, it promotes the maturation of connections between neurons, which is impaired in patients with FXS and has received the US FDA’s ODD as well as approved for investigational use in the US","GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Tetra Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shionogi & Co. Ltd., today announced positive topline results from its Phase 2 exploratory study in adult patients with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). The study evaluated its lead candidate, BPN14770, a first-in-class phosphodiesterase‐4D (PDE4D) allosteric inhibitor. In this single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study, BPN14770 demonstrated excellent safety as well as benefits on cognitive function and behavior in 30 patients with FXS.

BPN14770 is a novel therapeutic agent that selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase‐4D (PDE4D). In preclinical studies, BPN14770 promoted the maturation of connections between neurons, which is impaired in patients with FXS, the most common genetic form of Autism.

“We are very excited about the results of this study,” said Mark Gurney PhD, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tetra. “In addition to being safe and well tolerated, treatment with BPN14770 led to significant cognitive improvement, specifically in the language domains, and we also saw a clinically meaningful benefit in overall daily functioning. These findings validate our approach to treating this disease through a mechanism that addresses a core deficit in the disorder. On behalf of the entire Tetra team, I want to sincerely thank the patients, families and investigators who participated in this study as well as the FRAXA Research Foundation, for their assistance in this study.”

The Phase 2 clinical trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study. Each period was 12 weeks in duration with no washout between periods. The study enrolled 30 adult male subjects age 18-41 years with FXS due to >200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Subjects received daily oral doses of 25 mg twice a day of BPN14770 or placebo. Parents/caregivers and physician raters were blinded to treatment. Study enrollment occurred between July 9, 2018 and July 31, 2020. All subjects completed both treatment periods, although carryover effects limited the primary statistical analysis to Period 1. The following results, therefore, describe the outcomes for patients who received BPN14770 during Period 1, compared to those who received placebo.

Cognitive assessments using the NIH-Toolbox revealed significant benefit in Oral Reading Recognition (LSMean Difference +2.80, p=0.0157), Picture Vocabulary (+5.79, p=0.0342), and Cognition Crystallized Composite Score (+5.29, p=0.0018). Parent/Caregiver ratings using 100 point Visual Analog Scales revealed benefit that was judged to be clinically significant in Language (LSMean Difference +14.04, p=0.0051) and Daily Functioning (+14.53, p=0.0017). The benefit of BPN14770 was maintained up to 12 weeks after the crossover from drug to placebo. BPN14770 was very well tolerated in the Phase 2 trial with few adverse events.

“These results offer hope for Fragile X Syndrome patients and their parents” said Dr. Elizabeth Berry-Kravis, pediatric neurologist, Rush University Medical Center, and principal investigator. “The preponderance of clinical outcome measures were in favor of the drug. These included performance-based as well as parent and physician-rated scales which suggests a meaningful impact on the global FXS disease process. I find it exciting that we have a drug that potentially addresses a core deficit in FXS, a decrease in cAMP, that has been documented in patients as well as in the fly and mouse models of the disorder.”

About the Phase 2 Trial

The Phase 2 clinical trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study in 30 adult male patients with FXS, ages 18-45, to assess the safety and efficacy of BPN14770. The study was conducted at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois by principal investigator Elizabeth M. Berry-Kravis, M.D., Ph.D. with financial support from the FRAXA Research Foundation. Additional information is available through clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03569631).

About BPN14770

BPN14770 is a novel therapeutic agent that selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D) to increase the levels of cAMP, a key signaling molecule, in brain. In preclinical models, BPN14770 promotes the maturation of connections between neurons, which is impaired in patients with Fragile X Syndrome, an indication for which BPN14770 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This unique mechanism of action has the potential to improve cognitive and memory function in devastating CNS disorders, including FXS, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, learning/developmental disabilities and schizophrenia. BPN14770 currently is approved for investigational use only by the FDA.

 Results demonstrated that CT-P17 has equivalent efficacy to reference adalimumab i.e. ACR20 is 82.7% for both, 2EPs include ACR20/50/70 response rates, mean DAS28, CDAI & SDAI & EULAR (CRP) response, Ctrough of adalimumab is higher for CT-P17 & lower in the ADA positive subgroup than the ADA negative subgroup in both treatment groups, the safety profile is comparable
 Additionally, comparable PK and safety data is presented for CT-P17 in comparison with EU-approved & US-licensed adalimumab in 312 healthy subjects. Celltrion also presented PK and safety data for two delivery methods for CT-P17, the auto-injector (AI) and pre-filled syringe (PFS)","INCHEON, South Korea–(BUSINESS WIRE)–New data to be presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2020 demonstrate that the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and overall safety of CT-P17, a proposed high concentration (100mg/mL) and citrate-free adalimumab biosimilar, is comparable to reference adalimumab in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.

The randomised, double-blind, phase III study investigated the equivalence of CT-P17 to reference adalimumab in terms of efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and overall safety over 24 weeks.1 648 patients with active moderate-to-severe RA despite methotrexate (MTX) treatment were randomly assigned to receive 40mg of CT-P17 or reference adalimumab every 2 weeks up to week 24.

Results demonstrated CT-P17 has equivalent efficacy to reference adalimumab – the ACR20 response rate at week 24 was 82.7% (268/324) for both CT-P17 and reference adalimumab. Similar additional secondary efficacy endpoints were seen in terms of ACR20/50/70 response rates, mean DAS28 (CRP), clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and EULAR (CRP) response. The PK results in terms of mean Ctrough of adalimumab up to week 24 were slightly higher for CT-P17 and the mean Ctrough was generally lower in the anti-drug antibody (ADA) positive subgroup than the ADA negative subgroup in both treatment groups. The safety profile of CT-P17 up to week 24 was comparable to that of the reference adalimumab as the majority of events were grade 1 or grade 2 in intensity.1

“These phase III results show a comparable PK, efficacy and safety profile between CT-P17 and the reference adalimumab, building on evidence demonstrating that CT-P17 is equivalent to reference adalimumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis”, said Professor Edward Keystone, Senior Consultant Rheumatologist, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada. “These promising study results support the use of CT-P17, the first adalimumab biosimilar with high concentration and citrate-free formulation as an alternative option for eligible patients with rheumatoid arthritis.”

Further data presented by Celltrion Healthcare at ACR Convergence 2020 investigated the PK and safety of CT-P17 in comparison to EU-approved adalimumab (EU- adalimumab) and US- licensed adalimumab (US- adalimumab) in healthy subjects up to 10 weeks. In this phase I, randomised, double-blind, single-dose study, 312 healthy subjects aged 19 to 55 years were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either CT-P17, EU- adalimumab or US- adalimumab after a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of 40mg (100mg/mL). The results showed that the 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the geometric least squares mean ratio of each of the primary PK parameters (AUC0-inf, AUC0-last, and Cmax) were within the predefined equivalence margin of 80% to 125%. The overall safety profile was comparable, and the number of subjects who had positive ADA and neutralising ADA (NAb) results were also similar among the three treatment groups.2

Celltrion Healthcare also presented PK and safety data for two delivery methods for CT-P17, the auto-injector (AI) and pre-filled syringe (PFS). As part of the study, 193 healthy subjects were randomly split into two groups to receive 40mg of either CT-P17 AI or CT-P17 PFS. Following a single SC administration of CT-P17 via AI, mean peak and total systemic exposure (AUC0-inf, AUC0-last and Cmax) were equivalent with those of CT-P17 PFS, which indicates that CT-P17 AI could be a viable alternative administration option.3

Notes to editors:

About CT-P17 (biosimilar adalimumab)

CT-P17 is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that contains the active ingredient adalimumab. Adalimumab is a fully human anti–tumour necrosis factor α (anti-TNFα) monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), psoriasis (PsO), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), uveitis (UV) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). CT-P17 is the first proposed high concentration (100mg/mL) adalimumab biosimilar with citrate-free formulation, meaning it causes less pain upon injection.

A phase I randomised, double-blind, three-arm, single-dose study demonstrated PK and safety equivalence of CT-P17 to the high concentration (100mg/mL), citrate-free formulation of both US- and EU- sourced reference adalimumab in healthy subjects.2 A phase III randomised, double-blind study demonstrated the equivalence efficacy to CT-P17 at week 24 to reference adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis.1 A phase I, randomised, open-label, parallel group, single-dose study demonstrated PK equivalence of CT-P17 auto-injector (AI) and pre-filled syringe (PFS) in healthy subjects.3

51544,Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) + Avastin (bevacizumab) Receive the EC's Approval for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma,European Commission approves Roche’s Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for the treatment of people with the most common form of liver cancer,"The approval is based on P-III IMbrave150 study involves assessing of Tecentriq (atezolizumab, 1200mg) + Avastin (bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle vs sorafenib (400mg, bid) on days 1-21 of each 21-day cycle in 501 patients in a ratio (2:1) with unresectable HCC, prior not treated with systemic therapies
 Result: reduction in the risk of OS (42%); reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death, PFS (41%); showed improvement in both OS and PFS; Grade 3–4 AEs (57% vs 55%), published in the NEJM
 The approval follows an EMA’s CHMP positive opinion received in Sept’2020. The dual regimen also recently included as a class I, A recommendation by the ESMO for unresectable HCC, as well as by many clinical practice guidelines globally","Basel, 2 November 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has approved Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with Avastin® (bevacizumab) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy.

“Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is the first treatment to be approved in over a decade that has improved overall survival for people with previously untreated advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We’re delighted that people in Europe can now benefit from this combination and we look forward to working with individual countries within the EU to ensure people can access the combination as soon as possible.”

“The results of the IMbrave150 study mark a breakthrough in the treatment of advanced liver cancer, one of the few cancers with a rising death rate and limited options in the first-line setting,” said Dr Arndt Vogel, Professor of Medicine at Hannover Medical School. “After many failures in the last 12 years, the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin shows improvement in overall survival compared to sorafenib and offers patients the opportunity for improved disease control with a high overall response rate.”

The approval is based on results from the Phase III IMbrave150 study, which showed that Tecentriq in combination with Avastin reduced the risk of death (overall survival [OS]) by 42% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.58; 95% CI: 0.42–0.79; p=0.0006) and reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival [PFS]) by 41% (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.47–0.76; p<0.0001), compared with sorafenib. IMbrave150 is the first Phase III cancer immunotherapy study to show an improvement in both OS and PFS in people with unresectable HCC compared with sorafenib. Grade 3–4 adverse events occurred in 57% of people receiving Tecentriq and Avastin and 55% of people receiving sorafenib. The most frequent serious adverse reactions for the combination (≥2%) were bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and fever. These results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 14 May 2020.

Today’s approval follows a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in September 2020. In May 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for the treatment of people with unresectable or metastatic HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy. In addition, in October 2020 the China National Medical Products Administration approved the combination for the treatment of people with unresectable HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy. In total, the combination is now approved in 59 countries for people with unresectable HCC. Tecentriq in combination with Avastin was also recently included as a class I, A recommendation by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) for the treatment of unresectable HCC, as well as by many clinical practice guidelines globally.

Roche is committed to tackling liver disease right across the disease journey, from the earliest stages through to advanced disease, with the ultimate goal of one day stopping chronic liver disease.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMbrave150 study
IMbrave150 is a global Phase III, multicentre, open-label study of 501 people with unresectable HCC who had not received prior systemic therapy. People were randomised 2:1 to receive the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin or sorafenib. Tecentriq was administered intravenously (IV), 1200mg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, and Avastin was administered IV, 15mg/kg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Sorafenib was administered by mouth, 400mg twice per day, on days 1-21 of each 21-day cycle. People received the combination or the control arm treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The two primary endpoints were OS and independent review facility (IRF)-assessed PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Additional study endpoints included IRF-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and HCC mRECIST.

About hepatocellular carcinoma
HCC is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options and is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide.1 Every year, more than 750,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with HCC,1,2 with the majority of cases in Asia and almost half of all cases in China.2,3 In the US, the number of liver cancer cases have more than tripled since 1980 and HCC represents the fastest-rising cause of cancer-related death, while in Europe, liver cancer is also on the rise, accounting for more than 80,000 diagnoses and approximately 77,000 deaths each year.4-7 HCC develops predominantly in people with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis (B or C) or alcohol consumption, and typically presents at an advanced stage.1 The prognosis for unresectable HCC remains poor, with few systemic therapeutic options and a 1-year survival rate of less than 50% following diagnosis.8

About the Tecentriq and Avastin combination
There is a strong scientific rationale to support the use of Tecentriq plus Avastin in combination. The Tecentriq and Avastin regimen may enhance the potential of the immune system to combat a broad range of cancers. Avastin, in addition to its established anti-angiogenic effects, may further enhance Tecentriq’s ability to restore anti-cancer immunity, by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related immunosuppression, promoting T-cell tumour infiltration and enabling priming and activation of T-cell responses against tumour antigens.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and for hepatocellular carcinoma. In the US, Tecentriq is also approved in combination with Cotellic® (cobimetinib) and Zelboraf® (vemurafenib) for the treatment of people with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

About Avastin
Avastin is a prescription-only medicine that is a solution for intravenous infusion. It is a biologic antibody designed to specifically bind to a protein called VEGF that plays an important role throughout the lifecycle of the tumour to develop and maintain blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Avastin is designed to interfere with the tumour blood supply by directly binding to the VEGF protein to prevent interactions with receptors on blood vessel cells. The tumour blood supply is thought to be critical to a tumour’s ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasise).

At the time of the final overall survival analysis, median overall survival was not reached in the KISQALI® arm and was 40.9 months in the placebo arm. The median duration of follow-up was 34.6 months.1
Advanced breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59 years old.2,3
DORVAL, QC, Nov. 2, 2020 /CNW/ – Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (Novartis) is pleased to announce that statistically significant overall survival (OS) results for KISQALI® (ribociclib) in combination therapy have now been approved within the KISQALI® Product Monograph. The pivotal Phase III MONALEESA-7 trial evaluated KISQALI® with endocrine therapy (goserelin plus either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen) as initial treatment compared to placebo plus endocrine therapy, in pre- and perimenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer.1

At the time of the second (final) prespecified OS analysis, the study met its key secondary endpoint of OS, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in OS, and was consistent for the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) population and across exploratory subgroups.1

“This data with improved overall survival is very compelling for the medical community when making decisions about the optimal treatment for pre- and perimenopausal patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer,” said Dr. Karen Gelmon, Professor of Medicine, University of British Columbia and Medical Oncologist, BC Cancer.

“Overall survival is considered a very important outcome in oncology clinical trials,” said Dr. Nathaniel Bouganim, Medical Oncologist, McGill University Health Centre. “To achieve overall survival benefit in metastatic disease represents a promising advancement for patients, and the medical community looks forward to future data updates on ribociclib.”

For women living with metastatic breast cancer, also known as Stage IV breast cancer, the cancer has spread beyond the breast to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bones or brain.4 It may happen before or after treatment, or it may develop from reoccurring breast cancer.5 Although there have been advancements in early detection and treatment, there is still no cure for metastatic breast cancer.6 

“When young women are diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, many don’t know what that means and have difficulty processing that the cancer is terminal. Once the news sinks in, they focus on living as well as they can for as long as they can,” said MJ DeCoteau, Founder and Executive Director, Rethink Breast Cancer. “The new ribociclib data showing overall survival benefit in the most common type of breast cancer in young women is an exciting and significant step towards meeting the most urgent unmet need for these women.”

KISQALI® is indicated in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of pre/perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as initial endocrine-based therapy. In pre/perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. KISQALI® is also indicated in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as initial endocrine-based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy.1

“At Novartis, we are at the forefront of driving scientific advancements and are proud of our heritage in breast cancer. Our dedication to breast cancer is reflective of our continued development of multiple compounds within our current pipeline,” said Daniel Hébert, Vice-President, Medical Affairs, Oncology, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. Novartis leads the industry in the discovery of new therapies and combinations, especially in HR-positive breast cancer, the most common form of the disease. “We are pleased to make yet another strong medical data announcement around KISQALI® and its potential for overall survival benefit.”

KISQALI® is reimbursed in Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan under the respective provincial drug programs. Novartis continues to work towards securing coverage across the country.

About KISQALI® (ribociclib)
KISQALI® is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, a class of drugs that help slow the progression of cancer by inhibiting two proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). These proteins, when over-activated, can enable cancer cells to grow and divide too quickly. Targeting CDK4/6 may play a role in ensuring that cancer cells do not continue to replicate uncontrollably. KISQALI® was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals.

 The trial met its co-1EPs & 2EPs demonstrating deucravacitinib was superior to Otezla (apremilast) in the patients reaching a PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 @16wks. The overall safety profile of deucravacitinib was consistent with previously reported P-II results
 Deucravacitinib (BMS-986165, PO) is the first & only novel selective TYK2 inhibitor, currently being evaluated in psoriasis, PsA, lupus, and IBD","PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) today announced positive results from POETYK PSO-1, the first pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating deucravacitinib (BMS-986165), a novel, oral, selective tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. POETYK PSO-1 evaluated 6 mg of deucravacitinib once daily and met both co-primary endpoints versus placebo, with more patients achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, defined as at least a 75 percent improvement in PASI, and a static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) score of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0/1) after 16 weeks of treatment with deucravacitinib.

The trial also met multiple key secondary endpoints, including showing deucravacitinib was superior to Otezla® (apremilast) in the proportion of patients reaching a PASI 75 response and sPGA 0/1 at Week 16. The overall safety profile of deucravacitinib in the POETYK PSO-1 trial was consistent with previously reported Phase 2 results.

“With limited oral therapeutic options available for psoriasis, there remains a significant need for safe and effective oral therapies. This makes the positive topline results for deucravacitinib in the POETYK PSO-1 trial exciting for the psoriasis community,” said April Armstrong, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Dean and Professor of Dermatology at the University of Southern California. “These findings indicate deucravacitinib has the potential to be a new treatment option for people living with psoriasis and may provide clinically meaningful improvements with the convenience of oral administration.”

The company and principal investigators will complete a full evaluation of the POETYK PSO-1 data and share the detailed results at a future medical meeting. POETYK PSO-1 is the first of two global Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of deucravacitinib compared to placebo and Otezla in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Results from the second study, POETYK PSO-2, are expected in the first quarter of 2021. In addition to psoriasis, deucravacitinib is being studied in a wide spectrum of immune-mediated diseases, and the company will present results from its Phase 2 trial in psoriatic arthritis at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2020, taking place virtually November 5-9, 2020.

“We are encouraged by the efficacy and safety profile observed in the POETYK PSO-1 study, which supports the strong potential we see for deucravacitinib, our novel, oral, selective TYK2 inhibitor, to be an important new therapy in psoriasis,” said Samit Hirawat, M.D., executive vice president, chief medical officer, global drug development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We recognize there is a significant unmet need for new therapeutic options for people with immune-mediated diseases, such as psoriasis, and are committed to pursuing potential new medicines that will give physicians additional choices to effectively treat and manage their patients.”

About Deucravacitinib
Deucravacitinib (BMS-986165) is the first and only novel, oral, selective tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor in clinical studies across multiple immune-mediated diseases. Deucravacitinib’s selectivity is driven by a unique mechanism of action that is distinct from other kinase inhibitors. TYK2 is an intracellular signaling kinase that mediates signaling of IL-23, IL-12 and Type I IFN, which are naturally occurring cytokines involved in inflammatory and immune responses.

Deucravacitinib is being studied in a wide spectrum of immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition to POETYK PSO-1, Bristol Myers Squibb is evaluating deucravacitinib in four additional Phase 3 studies: POETYK PSO-2 (NCT03611751); POETYK PSO-3 (NCT04167462); POETYK PSO-4 (NCT03924427); POETYK PSO-LTE (NCT04036435). Deucravacitinib is not approved for any use in any country.

About POETYK PSO-1
PrOgram to Evaluate the efficacy and safety of BMS-986165, a selective TYK2 inhibitor PSO-1 (POETYK PSO-1, NCT03624127) is the first of two global Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of deucravacitinib compared to placebo and Otezla® (apremilast) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. POETYK PSO-1 is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled Phase 3 study. In total, 666 participants diagnosed with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomized in the study.

The co-primary outcome measures of the trial were the percentage of participants who achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 and the percentage of participants who achieved static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 0 to 1 at Week 16 versus placebo. Key secondary outcome measures of the trial include percentage of patients who achieved PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 compared to Otezla at Week 16.

About Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a widely prevalent, chronic, systemic immune-mediated disease that substantially impairs patients’ physical health, quality of life and work productivity. Psoriasis is a serious global problem, impacting at least 100 million people worldwide. Up to 90% of patients with psoriasis have psoriasis vulgaris, or plaque psoriasis, which is characterized by distinct, round or oval plaques typically covered by silvery white scales. People with psoriasis can experience social stigma that can lead to significant psychological distress, while accompanying pain can cause functional disability and reduced quality of life. Psoriasis is associated with multiple comorbidities that are known to reduce life expectancy, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, depression and malignancies.

 The collaboration will utilize the SomaLogic proteomic technology for the identification of circulating pharmacodynamic biomarkers for therapeutic biologics
 SomaLogic’s SomaScan platform makes 5,000 protein measurements simultaneously in small samples of blood, to compare changes in circulating proteins following treatment with FDA-approved biologics and could reduce the need for costly and lengthy comparative clinical studies","BOULDER, Colo., Oct. 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — SomaLogic, Inc. announced today an agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s Division of Applied Regulatory Science to evaluate the utility of large-scale analysis of proteins (proteomics) for the identification of biomarkers that may be useful in demonstrating biosimilarity of a proposed biosimilar to a reference biologic.

The collaborative project will use data generated on the SomaLogic SomaScan® Platform, which makes 5,000 protein measurements simultaneously in small samples of blood, to compare changes in circulating proteins following treatment with FDA-approved biologics. The protein measurements from an FDA-approved reference biologic could then be compared to those generated by a candidate biosimilar drug.

“Circulating proteins, when measured at the broadest scale, provide system-wide information on the dynamic effects of drug exposure-response,” said Stephen Williams, M.D., chief medical officer at SomaLogic. “Comparing the “blood protein fingerprint” of a biosimilar to a reference biologic has the potential to be more efficient and precise than clinical observations for establishing biosimilarity.”

Despite potential cost savings in the billions, the use of biosimilars in the US has been less widespread than originally hoped. At present, there are only 28 biosimilars approved by the FDA for only a small number of biologic drugs. Regulatory approval of a proposed biosimilar requires demonstration that it is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from an existing FDA-approved reference product, a process that can take several years. The research at the center of this agreement aims to advance the use of novel tools and approaches that could streamline biosmiliar development.

Under the terms of the new five-year agreement, SomaLogic will collaborate with the FDA to identify circulating pharmacodynamic biomarkers and analytical approaches that could be used to demonstrate biosimilarity of a candidate biosimilar drug to a reference FDA-approved biologic drug. If successful, this proteomic strategy could reduce the need for costly and lengthy comparative clinical studies. This, in turn, should streamline the development of biosimilars and thus accelerate delivery of safe, effective, and affordable biosimilar treatments to patients.

Specific details of the agreement were not disclosed.

51597,CEPI to Invest ~$328M in Clover's COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate,CEPI Extends Partnership With Clover Biopharmaceuticals to Fund COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Through Global Phase 2/3 Study to Licensure,"CEPI’s total investment in Clover’s S-Trimer vaccine candidate will be up to $328 M, including $69.5M previously announced have funded preclinical studies and P-l study, preparations for the global pivotal P-ll/lll efficacy study, and initial manufacturing scale-up activities
 The expanded collaboration will provide $258.5M for a global pivotal P-ll/lll efficacy clinical trial which is expected to begin before the end of 2020 and generates the safety and efficacy data to support licensure of the vaccine candidate in China and across the globe
 The collaboration anticipates that the vaccine will be made available for procurement and allocation through the COVAX Facility, which aims to fairly distribute 2B doses of COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021","OSLO, Norway & CHENGDU, China–(BUSINESS WIRE)–CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, today announced that it will fund the development of the protein-based S-Trimer COVID-19 vaccine candidate by Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Inc (China) (“Clover”) through a global pivotal Phase 2/3 efficacy clinical trial and to licensure in China and globally, if the vaccine is proven to be safe and effective.

CEPI’s total investment in Clover’s S-Trimer vaccine candidate will be up to $328 million, including previously announced commitments of $69.5 million which have funded preclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trials, preparations for the global pivotal Phase 2/3 efficacy study, and initial manufacturing scale-up activities. Promising preclinical and preliminary Phase 1 data – which will be published in a peer-reviewed publication in the near future – indicate that S-Trimer is well-tolerated and produces strong neutralizing antibody and Th1-biased cell-mediated immune responses, which merit ongoing evaluation of the vaccine candidate.

The expanded partnership is a result of Clover’s successful early stage clinical development of the S-Trimer vaccine candidate. It will provide full funding for a global pivotal Phase 2/3 efficacy clinical trial of S-Trimer which is expected to begin before the end of 2020 and aims to generate the necessary safety and efficacy data to support licensure of the vaccine candidate. It will also fund additional clinical studies in special populations, such as people with autoimmune conditions, immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women and children. In parallel to the clinical development process, the programme will continue scaling up the manufacturing process to potentially allow the production of more than one billion doses annually, and build up vaccine inventory which – if the vaccine is proven to be safe and effective – could be deployed rapidly upon licensure.

Clover is exploring development pathways for the S-Trimer vaccine to be made accessible to populations in China and globally, if it is proven to be safe and effective. CEPI and Clover are committed to ensuring equitable global access to the S-Trimer vaccine, and the agreement therefore anticipates that vaccine output funded by CEPI’s investment – potentially hundreds of millions of doses per year – will be made available for procurement and allocation through the COVAX Facility. The COVAX Facility is a global initiative which aims to procure and fairly distribute two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021, to help protect the most at-risk groups in all participating countries.

Dr. Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI said:

“The clinical development and manufacturing progress of Clover’s S-Trimer vaccine candidate are very promising so far, so I am pleased to extend our partnership with Clover through to potential licensure of the vaccine.”

“CEPI’s expanded investment will fund critical late-stage clinical trials to establish the efficacy of the vaccine, in parallel to scaling up the manufacturing process with the goal of making potentially hundreds of millions of doses of this vaccine available to those who need it through COVAX, if it is proven to be safe and effective.”

Joshua Liang, CEO of Clover said:“We are honoured to receive CEPI’s continued investment which is based on months of close collaboration and early preclinical, manufacturing scale-up, and clinical success in the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine for COVID-19. This expanded partnership enables Clover to advance our S-Trimer vaccine candidate into a global Phase 2/3 efficacy study by the end of this year and subsequently to Chinese and global licensure in 2021. We look forward to continuing our partnership with CEPI as we stay committed to developing a safe and efficacious vaccine for communities in need around the globe.”

COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine

Utilizing Clover’s proprietary Trimer-Tag© technology, S-Trimer is a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein subunit vaccine candidate. Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry, making it the primary target antigen for vaccine development. S-Trimer resembles the native trimeric viral spike protein and is produced via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system.

CEPI’s COVID-19 vaccine programme

Built on the principles of speed, scale and equitable access, CEPI is supporting the research and development of a diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates based on a range of vaccine approaches. Of the nine vaccine candidates currently in the CEPI portfolio – the world’s largest – eight have entered clinical trials out of 44 globally.

CEPI has raised US$1.3bn in support of COVID-19 vaccine research and development, but urgently needs $800m in additional funds to achieve its aim of developing three safe and effective vaccines which will be made globally available through COVAX. These funds are vital for CEPI to progress the most promising vaccine candidates in the portfolio through crucial late-stage clinical trials to prove their safety and efficacy, and ultimately to licensure.

CEPI, alongside Gavi and the World Health Organisation, co-leads the vaccines pillar of the ACT Accelerator – known as COVAX – which is working to accelerate research and development for promising vaccine candidates, manufacture doses at scale, and ensure rapid global access.

CEPI opened a Representative Office in Shanghai in April 2020. Through its Shanghai Representative Office, CEPI is seeking to cooperate broadly in China on COVID-19 vaccine development and build robust collaborations to prevent and control other potential infectious disease outbreaks in the future.

51607,Boston Scientific's Ranger DCB Receives the US FDA's Approval for Peripheral Artery Disease in the SFA and PPA,Boston Scientific Receives FDA Approval for the Ranger™ Drug-Coated Balloon,"The approval is based on the RANGER II SFA pivotal study assessing the Ranger DCB vs standard PTA for the treatment in patients with PAD in the SFA & PPA
 The study met its both 1EPs @12mos. i.e. MAE (94.1% vs 83.5%); lesion revascularization rate (5.5% vs 16.5%); Binary primary patency (82.9% vs 66.3%); primary patency by Kaplan-Meier estimate (89.8% vs 74.0%). The DCB has demonstrated 90% primary patency in COMPARE trial
 The company expects to initiate a registry of the Ranger DCB and the Eluvia stent in the coming months to gather additional RWE and plans to launch the device in the US","MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Nov. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Boston Scientific (NYSE: BSX) announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the Ranger™ Drug-Coated Balloon, developed for the treatment of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and proximal popliteal artery (PPA).

Approximately 200 million people around the world are affected by PAD1, a common circulatory problem in which plaque builds up and narrows arteries, consequently reducing blood flow to limbs. The Ranger DCB was designed with a low therapeutic drug dose and proprietary coating which efficiently transfers the drug into the tissue, resulting in high primary patency rates and low systemic drug exposure for patients. The low-profile platform of the balloon also assists clinicians in performing streamlined procedures and navigating through challenging anatomy in order to deliver consistent therapy.

“This approval allows us to bring more treatment options with exceptional outcomes and proven safety to U.S. physicians and their patients who are facing this challenging disease,” said Jeff Mirviss, president, Peripheral Interventions, Boston Scientific. “Adding the Ranger DCB to our drug-eluting portfolio, which also includes our Eluvia™ Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System, reinforces our commitment to providing differentiated technology with strong clinical evidence that supports data-driven treatment decisions for millions of patients suffering from PAD worldwide.”

The FDA approval is based on results from the RANGER II SFA pivotal trial, which evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the Ranger DCB versus standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of patients with PAD in the SFA and PPA. In the randomized controlled trial, both primary endpoints were met:

The primary safety endpoint of 12-month freedom from major adverse events (MAE) was 94.1% for those treated with the Ranger DCB versus 83.5% for standard PTA (Pnon-inferiority <0.0001).2
Additionally, patients who received therapy with the Ranger DCB had a significantly lower target lesion revascularization rate – a component of MAE – of 5.5% in contrast to 16.5% observed with standard PTA (p=0.0011), substantially reducing a patient’s need for repeat procedures.2
The primary efficacy endpoint of 12-month binary primary patency – a measure of the target vessel remaining unobstructed – was 82.9% for the Ranger DCB and 66.3% for standard PTA (p=0.0017). Primary patency by Kaplan-Meier estimate was 89.8% for the Ranger DCB and 74.0% for PTA at 12 months (p=0.0005).2
“The Ranger DCB eases deliverability for a wide range of lesion complexities via a low profile platform that is compatible with smaller diameter guidewires and has shown consistent results in multiple randomized controlled trials,” said Ravish Sachar, M.D., UNC Rex Hospital Physician-in-Chief for Heart and Vascular services and principal investigator of the RANGER II SFA trial. “For physicians seeking to limit systemic drug loss without compromising outcomes, data demonstrate the Ranger DCB is a safe and effective treatment option.”

The Ranger DCB also demonstrated nearly 90% primary patency in the investigator-sponsored COMPARE trial3 – the first head-to-head prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare two different DCBs. In the trial, the Ranger DCB demonstrated a similar primary patency rate of 88.4% to that of the 89.4% observed with IN.PACT™ Admiral™ Drug-Coated Balloon (Medtronic) by Kaplan-Meier estimate (p=0.81), with a significantly lower drug dose density (2 µg/mm2 paclitaxel versus 3.5 µg/mm2 paclitaxel, respectively).3,4

Boston Scientific expects to initiate a registry of the Ranger DCB and the Eluvia stent in the coming months to gather additional real-world evidence, which will add to the breadth of clinical data collected on these devices to date. The registry is expected to include five years of patient follow-up with an emphasis on enrolling patient populations who have been historically underrepresented in clinical trials studying treatments for PAD.

The company announced CE Mark for the Ranger DCB in 2014 and plans to immediately launch the device in the U.S.

 Vosoritide (qd) is an investigational injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) for children with achondroplasia and has received the US FDA’s & EMA’s ODD for the same","SAN RAFAEL, Calif., Nov. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for vosoritide, an investigational, once daily injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) for children with achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans. This acceptance by the FDA marks the first marketing application accepted for a treatment for achondroplasia in the United States

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date is Aug. 20, 2021. The FDA has informed the company that they are not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application.

Although the FDA did not identify any filing issues with the NDA, the Agency reiterated a position raised during the Pediatric Advisory Committee (PAC) and Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) held on May 11, 2018 recommending two-year controlled trials in different age groups. BioMarin believes the highly persuasive outcomes from the one-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial, coupled with data from the Phase 2 program with up to 5 years of long-term follow-up that has been compared to robust natural history data on growth, offers a rigorous and reliable method to assess whether vosoritide has a durable impact on the rate of endochondral bone growth that ultimately increases final adult height. This information was included in the marketing application.

While not part of the vosoritide marketing application, in Q4, the Company is also expecting to complete enrollment in a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled study of vosoritide in approximately 70 infants and young children with achondroplasia, aged zero to less than 60 months, for a period of 52 weeks. The study will be followed by a subsequent open-label extension trial when all subjects receive active treatment. Children in this study will complete a minimum three-month baseline study to determine their respective baseline growth prior to dosing in the Phase 2 study. Children in this study will have completed a minimum three-month baseline study to determine their respective baseline growth prior to entering the Phase 2 study. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate safety, tolerability, and the effect of vosoritide on height Z-scores, which is the number of standard deviations in relation to the mean height of age-matched, average stature children. The company also plans to augment the height Z-score data with assessments including proportionality, functionality, quality of life, sleep apnea, and foramen magnum dimension, as well as the advent of major illnesses and surgeries.

“We are looking forward to working with the FDA and other regulatory authorities to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the potentially first pharmacological treatment for children with achondroplasia. In addition to the completed clinical studies included in the application, we have included a natural history study to understand the progression of achondroplasia and medical implications,” said Hank Fuchs, M.D., President Worldwide Research and Development at BioMarin. “Our extensive development program has been focused on addressing the underlying cause of achondroplasia. We continue to respect the community’s range of views around treatment options. We are grateful to the families who have participated in the clinical trials, the advocacy groups from around the world, and the study investigators, all who have been on this journey with us to deliver a treatment choice and contribute to further understanding achondroplasia medically and scientifically.”

“This is important progress that could lead to the first pharmacological treatment of the underlying cause of achondroplasia. As a treating physician, I feel that it is very important that such treatment options become available to families who may want to consider them for their child,” said John A. Phillips III, M.D., Vanderbilt University Medical Center (David T Karzon Professor of Pediatrics) and investigator for the vosoritide clinical program. “The comprehensive clinical program for vosoritide provides scientific and clinical knowledge that focuses on the safety and efficacy of vosoritide and better understanding of the basic cause of achondroplasia, its natural history and treatment.”

“We are hopeful that our community is one step closer to having access to the first therapeutic choice for children and families affected by achondroplasia,” said Munira Haider, co-founder of Growing Stronger. “We advocate for rigorous scientific and medical research to improve the quality of medical care for little people.”

Growing Stronger’s mission is to improve the quality of medical care for people through supporting research. The organization raises nonprofit donations that are granted to researchers focused on dwarfism.

Regulatory Status in the U.S. and Europe

BioMarin previously announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated the Company’s Marketing Authorization Application. Vosoritide has also received orphan drug designation from the FDA and EMA for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. The Orphan Drug Designation program is intended to advance the evaluation and development of products that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions.

About Achondroplasia

Achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans, is characterized by slowing of endochondral ossification, which results in disproportionate short stature and disordered architecture in the long bones, spine, face and base of the skull. This condition is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), a negative regulator of bone growth. Beyond disproportionate short stature, people with achondroplasia can experience serious health complications, including foramen magnum compression, sleep apnea, bowed legs, mid-face hypoplasia, permanent sway of the lower back, spinal stenosis and recurrent ear infections. Some of these complications can result in the need for invasive surgeries such as spinal cord decompression and straightening of bowed legs. In addition, studies show increased mortality at every age.

More than 80% of children with achondroplasia have parents of average stature and have the condition as the result of a spontaneous gene mutation. The worldwide incidence rate of achondroplasia is about one in 25,000 live births. Vosoritide is being tested in children whose growth plates are still “open”, typically those under 18 years of age. This is approximately 25% of people with achondroplasia. In the U.S., Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and most of Asia Pacific, there are currently no licensed medicines for achondroplasia.

51628,Jounce Stops Enrollment in P-II EMERGE Study Evaluating Vopratelimab for Lung Cancer,Jounce Therapeutics Announces Update on Vopratelimab Program,"The company will not expand the P-II EMERGE study that assesses Vopratelimab + ipilimumab in PD-(L)1 inhibitor experienced NSCLC patient. Early evaluation of the study showed that the trial will not meet pre-specified interim criteria for continuation of enrollment
 The company also reported the first patient dosing in P-II SELECT study assessing Vopratelimab + JTX-4014 vs JTX-4014 alone in 75 immunotherapy naïve NSCLC patients who have been pre-selected with the TISvopra predictive biomarker with its expected preliminary efficacy data in 2021
 Vopratelimab is a mAb that binds to and activates ICOS which is a protein on the surface of certain T cells found in many solid tumors","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: JNCE), a clinical-stage company focused on the discovery and development of novel cancer immunotherapies and predictive biomarkers, today provided an update on its vopratelimab (vopra) program. The intent of the EMERGE Phase 2 trial was to induce ICOS hi CD4 T cells with ipilimumab, and then administer vopra with the goal of increasing proliferation and expansion of these ICOS hi CD4 T cells, which were associated with durable clinical benefit in the ICONIC trial of vopra alone and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. Early evaluation of the data from the EMERGE trial of vopra in combination with ipilimumab in PD-(L)1 inhibitor experienced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients indicates the trial will not meet pre-specified interim criteria for continuation of enrollment. Therefore, the EMERGE trial will not be expanded. The company also announced the first patient dosed in the SELECT Phase 2 trial, supporting vopra’s potential in combination with JTX-4014 in immunotherapy naïve biomarker-selected NSCLC patients.

“We are disappointed that an early look at the EMERGE data indicates that we will not meet our pre-specified interim criteria for continued enrollment,” said Beth Trehu, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Jounce Therapeutics. “Less than 50% of the EMERGE patients had emergence of ICOS hi CD4 T cells after ipilimumab treatment, indicating that CD4 T cell activation by CTLA-4 inhibitors may be impaired in PD-(L)1 inhibitor resistant patients. Patients who have progressed on or after PD-1 inhibitor therapies represent a large and growing unmet need and new therapeutic mechanisms may be needed to more effectively treat these patients. We would like to thank the patients, investigators and study teams for their participation in the EMERGE trial.”

“The PD-(L)1 experienced or resistant population continues to prove difficult to treat. To bring necessary benefit to these patients it is becoming clearer that novel approaches beyond T cells may be needed as part of the solution,” said Richard Murray, Ph.D., chief executive officer and president of Jounce Therapeutics. “Our pipeline beyond vopra is focused on these novel approaches and we believe our existing programs, particularly, JTX-8064, our lead macrophage program targeting LILRB2 (ILT4), and other programs from our discovery platform, are poised to make meaningful contributions to both the PD-(L)1 naïve and resistant populations.”

EMERGE Enrollment, Dosing and Safety
Fifty-nine patients were enrolled, 50 of whom are evaluable based on pre-specified criteria which required at least one dose of each drug and at least one CT scan for response assessment or clinical progression without a CT. Vopra continued to be safe and the combination with ipilimumab was well tolerated. The type and frequency of adverse events were similar to those seen with ipilimumab.

Summary of EMERGE Preliminary Efficacy Data

* Dose not protocol-specified, due to dosing error at a single study site; ** Confidence interval; *** Not estimable; Ipilimumab was dosed for a maximum of 4 doses. Data as of October 26, 2020

The data for all doses combined, with or without including the 10 subjects dosed at .01 mg/kg, did not meet the pre-specified criteria for continuation of enrollment in the trial, with tumor reduction in 38% of patients and one confirmed RECIST 1.1 response. In the .10 mg/kg cohort, 55% of patients had tumor reduction and confirmed overall response rate (ORR) is 4.5%. Median overall survival (OS) for all dose groups combined was 11.6 months and has not been reached in the .10 and .03 mg/kg cohorts. Nine patients remain on study, including four patients continuing to benefit on vopra alone after completion of up to four ipilimumab doses. The biomarker analysis is not yet complete.

EMERGE Interim Analysis Clinical Criteria to Expand Trial

Tumor reduction in ≥ 50% of patients,
Median overall survival tracking to ≥ 13 months, and
Overall response rate ≥ 10%
Interim analysis criteria were selected to provide preliminary evidence that a combination of vopra and ipilimumab could potentially be superior to docetaxel in a randomized Phase 3 trial with an overall survival endpoint. Early data evaluation indicates, across all EMERGE doses, these interim criteria cannot be met and EMERGE will not be expanded beyond current enrollment.

SELECT
SELECT and EMERGE were developed to address distinct hypotheses for the potential of vopra and ICOS hi CD4 cells to improve patient outcomes. These trials are also addressing different patient populations, PD-(L)1 inhibitor resistant versus PD-(L)1 inhibitor naïve and biomarker selected.

The randomized Phase 2 SELECT trial of vopra in combination with Jounce’s PD-1 inhibitor, JTX-4014 began enrollment in October 2020. The trial compares vopra plus JTX-4014 to JTX-4014 alone in immunotherapy naïve NSCLC patients who have been pre-selected with the TISvopra predictive biomarker. SELECT will enroll approximately 75 patients. TISvopra is an 18 gene RNA tumor inflammation signature which was optimized to predict the emergence of ICOS hi CD4 T cells and associated clinical benefit. SELECT is powered to demonstrate the statistical superiority of the combination of vopratelimab plus JTX-4014 compared to JTX-4014 alone. Preliminary efficacy data from the SELECT trial is expected in 2021.

51638,Abbott to Launch its Cardiac Mapping Platform in Europe and Australia,ABBOTT INTRODUCES NEXT-GENERATION 3D CARDIAC MAPPING PLATFORM IN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA,"The company has received CE mark in EU and approval in Australia for its new EnSite X EP system which offers the option to navigate the cardiac anatomy in two different ways on one platform.
 The system can create a 3D model of the patient’s cardiac anatomy in real time and will enable physicians to spot areas of the heart that need ablation treatment. The system is currently pending 510(k) clearance from the US FDA
 Additionally, the company has received the US FDA & CE mark approval for the EnSite LiveView Dynamic Display, which allows data from the Advisor HD Grid mapping catheter, Sensor Enabled to be visualized in real-time during cardiac ablation procedures","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Nov. 2, 2020 — Abbott today announced it has received CE Mark and approval in Australia for its new EnSite™ X EP System, and is launching the system throughout Europe and Australia. The EnSite X System is the only system that offers the option to navigate the cardiac anatomy two different ways on one platform. Abbott sought physician feedback to develop the EnSite X System to meet current needs as well as address emerging opportunities during cardiac ablation procedures. The new cardiac mapping platform builds upon the company’s electrophysiology portfolio and is designed to improve how physicians deliver ablation therapy to treat abnormal heart rhythms.

Cardiac mapping systems allow electrophysiologists to create a map of the heart, helping them get a clear picture of the electrical signals that control cardiac rhythms. Once a map is created, physicians can identify electrical disruptions—or areas of the heart causing heart rhythm problems—and use ablation therapy to treat the issue. Cardiac ablation is a minimally invasive procedure that can treat abnormally fast heartbeats by creating lesions (ablations) in small areas of heart tissue that a physician has identified as causing the arrhythmia.

The EnSite X System has advanced imaging capabilities that allow for the creation of a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient’s cardiac anatomy in real-time, allowing physicians to clearly see areas of the heart that need ablation treatment. Physicians can choose traditional impedance monitoring (using mechanical activity of the heart) or electromagnetic technology, which allows precise location of Abbott’s sensor-enabled catheters during treatment.

“The new EnSite X System will fundamentally change how physicians approach longer, more complex ablation procedures as a result of its improved stability, faster mapping and better model visualization,” said Prof. Paolo Della Bella, Head of the Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmology at IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy. “In my first cases with the system it’s been apparent that the system is an important step forward in terms of technological capabilities and also truly helps improve my clinical analysis by protecting for patient movements.”

The various aspects of the EnSite X System are designed to work in harmony and allow ongoing updates as technology advances. The new mapping system is among a series of product-focused activities from Abbott designed to improve patient care and meet the needs of electrophysiologists around the world.

The company also recently secured U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CE Mark approval for the EnSite™ LiveView Dynamic Display, which allows data from the Advisor™ HD Grid mapping catheter, Sensor Enabled™ to be visualized in real-time during cardiac ablation procedures. The Advisor HD Grid catheter, SE is designed to capture information often missed with traditional mapping catheters. Additionally, physicians use magnetically sensor enabled technology, such as the TactiCath™ Contact Force Ablation Catheter, Sensor Enabled™, for precise location and navigation within the heart.

“The high-density cardiac mapping capability this new system offers helps me to more quickly and accurately collect data and diagnose arrhythmias,” said Prof. Isabel Deisenhofer, Head of Electrophysiology at the German Heart Center, Munich Germany. “The combination of the EnSite X System with the Advisor HD Grid mapping catheter, SE allows me to most effectively treat each patient’s unique needs without having to compromise our workflow in the EP lab.”

The EnSite X EP System is currently pending 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

About Cardiac Ablation:

When physicians use catheter ablation to treat cardiac arrhythmias, long flexible tubes — called catheters — are inserted into the heart to study the arrhythmia and to deliver radio frequency energy. Heat generated from the radio frequency energy creates a scar on the tissue where the abnormal heartbeats originate. As a result, this tissue is no longer capable of conducting or sustaining the arrhythmia.

About Abbott’s Electrophysiology Business

The Abbott electrophysiology (EP) business is one of the fastest growing segments within the company’s broader device portfolio. The Abbott EP product portfolio gives physicians the diagnostic, access, mapping and therapy solutions they need with designed integration for enhanced diagnosis and treatment of heart arrhythmias. A leader in collaborating with world-renowned electrophysiologists, clinicians and hospital administrators, Abbott develops safe and cost-effective treatment solutions for patients in need of advanced ablation therapies.

The title of this study is “Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of the Biosimilar HLX03 Compared with Adalimumab in Chinese Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis: A Randomised, Double-blind, Phase 3 Equivalence Study”. Professor Jianzhong Zhang from Peking University People’s Hospital, is the leading principle investigator of this study. It’s the first time that Henlius has released this Phase 3 study results. This study will help to accumulate more clinical evidence and experience of adalimumab biosimilar in this patient population.
HLX03 is an adalimumab biosimilar independently developed by Henlius in accordance with the “Technical Guidelines of Development and Evaluation of Biosimilar Drugs” to be used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis etc. Different from currently approved adalimumab biosimilars in China, the Phase 3 clinical trial of HLX03 was conducted among Chinese patients with psoriasis and provided valuable data for this population. The results show that the efficacy of HLX03 for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is equivalent to that of the reference adalimumab injection, and it is also similar to the reference drug in terms of safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics. As of now, the new drug application (NDA) for HLX03 was accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), and was assigned to the priority review list by the NMPA. Recently, Henlius drug substance (DS) line and drug product (DP) line for the production of HLX03 has successfully passed the on-site inspection conducted by Shanghai Medical Products Administration. HLX03 is expected to be approved for launch by the end of 2020, which hopefully will benefit more patients with autoimmune diseases in China.
Study Design

HLX03-Ps03 is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-controlled, phase 3 study (NCT03316781) comparing the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of HLX03 with reference adalimumab in Chinese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Enrolled patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either HLX03 or reference adalimumab by subcutaneous injection with an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 1 Day 1, followed by a dose of 40 mg at Week 2 Day 1, and then 40 mg every two weeks for up to Week 48. The primary endpoint was the percentage of improvement of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index at Week 16 (PASIwk16) relative to baseline.
Results

Efficacy
1）Primary Endpoint
262 patients were enrolled (HLX03, n = 132; Reference adalimumab, n = 130) in this study. Per FAS, the percentage improvement of PASIwk16 was 83.48% in HLX03 group and 82.02% in reference adalimumab group. The least square mean difference was 1.46% (95% CI: −3.86%, 6.79%), which fell entirely in the pre-defined equivalence margins (±15%), demonstrating equivalent efficacy between HLX03 and reference adalimumab.
2）Secondary Endpoints
There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups in secondary endpoints (including the percentage of subjects reaching an improvement of PASI by at least 75% relative to baseline, the percentage of improvement of PASI relative to baseline, the percentage of subjects with Physician’s Global Assessment [PGA] reaching clearance or close to clearance, and the change in Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] relative to baseline) at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 32, 50.
Safety and Immunogenicity
The safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar between HLX03 and reference adalimumab.
Conclusion

The results of the phase 3 study demonstrated the equivalence in efficacy between HLX03 and reference adalimumab with similar safety and immunogenicity profiles. HLX03 is expected to provide an alternative treatment option for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as an adalimumab biosimilar candidate.

51669,BioInvent Presents New Clinical and Preclinical Data of BI-1206 at ASH Annual Meeting,"BioInvent presents promising new clinical and preclinical data on anti-FcγRllB antibody, BI-1206, at the ASH Annual Meeting","The data includes P-l/lla study involves assessing BI-1206 + rituximab in patients with FL, MZL and MCL who have r/r to rituximab. The study demonstrated at BI-1206 is generating the first signs of clinical response in patients
 The company also presents results from two preclinical studies. The preclinical data further reinforce the efficacy and tolerability profile of BI-1206
 BI-1206 has a novel mode-of-action, acts by blocking the single inhibitory Ab checkpoint receptor FcγRIIB to unlock anti-cancer immunity in both liquid and solid tumors. The therapy is currently being evaluated in P-I/II study in combination with Keytruda & in P-I/IIa study in combination with MabThera (rituximab) for NHL","LUND, Sweden, Nov. 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BioInvent International AB (“BioInvent” or the “Company”) (OMXS: BINV), a biotech company focused on the discovery and development of novel and first-in-class immune-modulatory antibodies for cancer immunotherapy, today announces it will present new clinical and preclinical data on its novel anti-FcγRIIB antibody, BI-1206, at the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, taking place virtually on December 5-8, 2020.

This includes preliminary data from a Phase I/IIa trial of BI-1206 in combination with rituximab in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have relapsed or are refractory to rituximab.

The data demonstrate that increasing doses of BI-1206 from 30 mg to 70 or 100 mg gave rise to a supra-proportional increase in the maximum concentration recorded, as well as an increase in the half-life of BI-1206. In addition, the higher dose levels (70 or 100 mg) showed close to full receptor saturation up to 72 hours. Increasing the dose further will likely give rise to sustained receptor saturation over an extended period. Furthermore, complete (CR) and partial (PR) clinical responses, as assessed by reduction of tumor size, were observed, in particular in the 70 mg cohort, where 3 of 5 patients have shown clinical responses.

“These data are very encouraging and indicate the strong potential of BI-1206 to make a significant difference to patients with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL. In particular, these preliminary data suggest that BI-1206 is generating the first signs of clinical responses in patients who have relapsed after treatment with rituximab. Importantly, overcoming target-mediated drug disposition will allow weekly or even less frequent dosing,” said Martin Welschof, CEO of BioInvent.

“Our recent China licensing agreement for BI-1206 with CASI Pharmaceuticals is an important validation of BioInvent’s technology, expertise and business model. It provides further impetus to our lead drug candidate, and we look forward to continuing development of this novel treatment option in hematological cancers and solid tumors, and bringing it closer to the market.”

BioInvent will also present results from two preclinical studies with BI-1206. Results from the first study show that BI-1206 had single agent activity in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model comprising ibrutinib-venetoclax resistant MCL cells in vivo. BI-1206 enhanced the in vivo efficacy of ibrutinib plus rituximab and venetoclax plus rituximab and overcame resistance to these treatments, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor effects.

In the second preclinical study in mice, pre-medication with two doses of corticosteroids (16-24h and 1h prior to infusion) prevented infusion-related reactions associated with intravenous anti-FcyRIIB administration. This pre-medication regimen has been implemented in the clinical trials of BI-1206 and shown to greatly improve the tolerability profile.

BI-1206 has a novel mode-of-action, blocking the single inhibitory antibody checkpoint receptor FcγRIIB to unlock anti-cancer immunity in both liquid and solid tumors. BI-1206 is BioInvent’s lead drug candidate and is being investigated in a Phase I/II trial, in combination with anti-PD1 therapy Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), in solid tumors, and in a Phase I/IIa trial in combination with MabThera® (rituximab) for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

51684,Novartis Reports Results of Cosentyx (secukinumab) in P-IIIb ULTIMATE Study for Psoriatic Arthritis,Novartis Cosentyx shows early synovitis reduction in patients with psoriatic arthritis in first-of-its-kind study,"The P-IIIb ULTIMATE study involves assessing Cosentyx (300/150mg) vs PBO weekly for a mos. with treatment starting @4wks., followed by a once-a-month dose for the next 11mos. in 166 biologic-naïve patients in a ratio (1:1) with active PsA
 The study reduction of synovitis @12wks. with an early improvement observed as 1wk., ACR20 (68% vs 34%); ACR50 (46% vs 9%,) & enthesitis (change in SPARCC, -2.4 vs -1.7); safety profile was consistent with previous studies @12wks.
 Cosentyx is the first & only fully-human biologic that directly inhibits IL-17A. Novartis anticipates disclosing full 24-week data from the ongoing ULTIMATE trial at the EULAR in 2021 and final analysis at ACR 2021","Basel, November 5, 2020 — Novartis, a leader in rheumatology and immuno-dermatology, today announced 12-week results from the first-of-its-kind Phase IIIb ULTIMATE randomized controlled trial, which demonstrated the significant treatment response of Cosentyx® (secukinumab) on synovitis (joint lining inflammation) in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) versus placebo. Synovitis was assessed using an advanced and sensitive imaging technique called Power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS). These data are being presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) All-Virtual Annual Meeting, November 5-9, 2020.

“Psoriatic arthritis can have a significant impact on a patient’s joints. Joint lining inflammation, also known as synovitis, if left untreated, can cause pain to worsen, joint damage and may decrease physical function,” said Dr. Maria A. D’Agostino, Professor of Rheumatology at the Catholic University of Rome. “These data are highly encouraging, showing Cosentyx can significantly reduce synovitis at Week 12 versus placebo with results seen as early as Week 1, and that ultrasound is a sensitive and objective tool to monitor joint inflammation in PsA patients.”

The use of a standardized ultrasound synovitis score (GLOESS) as the primary endpoint showed objectively the significant benefit of Cosentyx versus placebo on synovitis at Week 12 with an early improvement observed from Week one. Treatment with Cosentyx also significantly improved key secondary endpoints versus placebo, including ACR20 (68% vs 34%, respectively), ACR50 (46% vs 9%, respectively) and enthesitis (mean change from baseline in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada enthesitis index score [SPARCC] of -2.4 vs -1.7 respectively)1. The safety profile of Cosentyx through 12 weeks was consistent with previous studies1.

Novartis anticipates disclosing full 24-week data from the ongoing ULTIMATE trial at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) annual meeting in 2021 and final analysis at ACR 2021.

“As a strong believer in the diagnostic and treatment monitoring benefits of ultrasound, this first large randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in PsA with an ultrasonographic primary endpoint is incredibly exciting. The ability to use a sensitive imaging technique to assess synovitis and enthesitis in PsA represents a breakthrough in how we conceptualize treatment goals,” said Dr. Catherine Bakewell of Intermountain Medical Group in Salt Lake City, UT and an investigator in the ULTIMATE study. “In addition to other measures, PDUS helps to provide earlier insight into treatment response, and that patients are more effectively treated across multiple domains of this heterogeneous psoriatic disease spectrum.”

PsA is a complex disease with multiple manifestations driving patient symptoms3,4. In PsA, synovitis may lead to joint damage and if left untreated, the joint damage can be irreversible5,6. In addition to reducing synovitis, Cosentyx has been proven to provide long-lasting inhibition of radiographic progression in PsA, limiting joint damage and helping to improve outcomes for patients with this debilitating condition7,8.

Plain Language Media Summaries for ULTIMATE and other key abstracts presented at ACR 2020 are available from the Novartis website: https://www.novartis.com/our-focus/immunology-dermatology/abstract-summaries-acr

About Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)
PsA is estimated to affect up to 50 million people worldwide9,10. It is part of a family of life-long inflammatory diseases (spondyloarthritis) that target the joints and is closely associated with psoriasis10. Up to 40% of patients with psoriasis may develop PsA10. Symptoms of PsA include joint pain and stiffness, skin and nail psoriasis, swollen toes and fingers, persistent painful swelling of the tendons and irreversible joint damage10.

About ULTIMATE
ULTIMATE is the first ongoing 52-week double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIIb study using ultrasound to assess time-course of response of Cosentyx on synovitis in psoriatic arthritis. The study enrolled 166 adult biologic-naïve patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either secukinumab (300-mg or 150-mg according to severity of skin disease) or placebo weekly for a month with treatment starting at Week 4, followed by a once-a-month dose for the next 11 months.

The primary endpoint is the difference in mean change from baseline to Week 12 between secukinumab and placebo in Global Omeract-European League Against Rheumatism Ultrasound Synovitis Score (GLOESS). GLOESS is a standardized composite score that has shown to be sensitive to change and is able to detect and score synovitis11. Secondary endpoints include ACR20, ACR50 and change in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) enthesitis index from baseline to Week 12 compared with placebo.

ACR20 and ACR50 are composite measures defined as both improvement of 20% or 50% in the number of tender and number of swollen joints, and a 20% or 50% improvement in three of the following five criteria: patient global assessment, physician global assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire, visual analog pain scale and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein12. The SPARCC enthesitis index is a validated clinical tool for evaluation of enthesitis13,14.

About Cosentyx® (secukinumab)
Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human biologic that directly inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)15-17. Cosentyx is the only biologic with proven efficacy in all key manifestations of PsA18.

Cosentyx is backed by more than 12 years of clinical experience and long-term five-year data across three indications of psoriasis, PsA and AS, as well as data from real-world evidence19-24. These data strengthen the unique position of Cosentyx as a rapid and long-lasting comprehensive treatment across axial spondyloarthritis, PsA and psoriatic disease, with more than 400,000 patients treated worldwide with Cosentyx since launch2 and plans to expand to 10 indications over the next 10 years.

Additionally, Novavax has multiple agreements for the supply of NVX-CoV2373 directly to the US, UK, Canada, and through partnerships, supply to Japan, South Korea, and India","GAITHERSBURG, Md., Nov. 04, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), a late stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced the signing of a non-binding Heads of Terms document with the Australian Government to supply 40 million doses of the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, for the Australian community.

“This arrangement with the Australian Government reflects the importance of the ongoing clinical development of NVX-CoV2373, and will ensure that the citizens of Australia will have access to its supply,” said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Novavax. “We are pleased with the progress of our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK, and are pressing forward to deliver efficacy data for NVX-CoV2373, with interim data in this event-driven trial expected as soon as early first quarter 2021.”

The Heads of Terms provides for the delivery of NVX-CoV2373 to Australia starting as early as the first half of 2021, subject to the successful completion of Phase 3 clinical development and approval of the vaccine by Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The vaccine regimen is expected to require two doses per individual, administered 21 days apart.

To date, Novavax has established various agreements for the supply of NVX-CoV2373 directly to the United States and the United Kingdom, Canada and now Australia, and through partnerships, supply to Japan, South Korea and India.

Australia’s clinical trial contribution

Australia has played a pivotal role in the clinical development program for NVX-CoV2373. Australian clinical researchers led the global Phase 1 clinical trial in August. This trial involved 131 Australians across two trial sites (Melbourne and Brisbane). In addition, approximately 690 Australians have participated in the Phase 2 arm of the clinical trial, which has been conducted across up to 40 sites in Australia and the U.S.

The planned global Phase 3 clinical programs evaluating NVX-CoV2373 will assess immunity, safety and COVID-19 disease prevention. The trials seek to recruit members of the community most vulnerable to COVID-19 – the elderly, those with underlying medical conditions as well as diverse racial and ethnic representation.

About NVX-CoV2373

NVX-CoV2373 is a vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. NVX-CoV2373 was created using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and contains Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. NVX-CoV2373 contains purified protein antigen and cannot replicate, nor can it cause COVID-19. In preclinical trials, NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated induction of antibodies that block binding of spike protein to receptors targeted by the virus, a critical aspect for effective vaccine protection. In the Phase 1 portion of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial, NVX-CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited robust antibody responses numerically superior to that seen in human convalescent sera. NVX-CoV2373 is also being evaluated in a Phase 3 trial in the UK and two ongoing Phase 2 studies that began in August; a Phase 2b trial in South Africa, and a Phase 1/2 continuation in the U.S. and Australia. Novavax has secured $2 billion in funding for its global coronavirus vaccine program, including up to $388 million in funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

About Matrix-M™

Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant has demonstrated a potent and well-tolerated effect by stimulating the entry of antigen presenting cells into the injection site and enhancing antigen presentation in local lymph nodes, boosting immune response.

About Manufacturing

Novavax is progressing large-scale manufacturing of NVX-CoV2373 across multiple locations around the world. Delivery of initial doses of the vaccine is expected as early as the end of this year, with the goal to expand the production to enable delivery of over 2 billion doses annually, once all production is online.

About Novavax

Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX) is a late-stage biotechnology company that promotes improved health globally through the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative vaccines to prevent serious infectious diseases. Novavax is currently conducting multiple clinical trials for NVX-CoV2373, its vaccine candidate against the virus that causes COVID-19, including a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the United Kingdom to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in individuals aged 18-84 years of age. NanoFlu™, its quadrivalent influenza nanoparticle vaccine, met all primary objectives in its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in older adults. Both candidate vaccines incorporate Novavax’ proprietary saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Novavax is a leading innovator of recombinant vaccines; its proprietary recombinant technology platform combines the power and speed of genetic engineering to efficiently produce highly immunogenic nanoparticles in order to address urgent global health needs.

51707,Coloplast Acquires Nine Continents Medical,"Coloplast acquires Nine Continents Medical, Inc.","Coloplast has acquired implantable tibial nerve stimulation (ITNS) treatment developer Nine Continents Medical for $145M upfront and an additional contingent milestone. ITNS is developed for overactive bladder (OAB)
 Coloplast expected to initiate clinical studies of ITNS in 2021 with the goal to obtain pre-market approval for a Class III device in the US and EU market approvals in the 2024-2025 timeframe
 ITNS is a miniaturized, self-powered unit placed in the lower leg in a short, minimally invasive procedure under local anesthesia. The unit does not require patient activation, recharging, or recurring visits to the doctor and works on the clinically proven MoA of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation","Coloplast announced today that it has completed the acquisition of Nine Continents Medical, Inc., an early stage company pioneering an implantable tibial nerve stimulation treatment for over-active bladder. The acquisition price consists of USD 145 million upfront cash payment and an additional contingent future milestone payment.

Founded in 2014, Nine Continents Medical, Inc. is a privately held company that has developed an innovative solution for over-active bladder (OAB), a condition characterized by a range of symptoms including the need to urinate more frequently, increased urgency, incontinence or leakage, and a need to urinate at night. The device is an implantable tibial nerve stimulator (ITNS), a miniaturized, self-powered unit placed in the lower leg under local anesthesia during a short, minimally invasive procedure. The solution requires no patient activation, recharging or recurring doctor visits, and builds on the clinically proven mode of action of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation, which is an OAB treatment available on the market today.

Coloplast’s ambition is that clinical studies will demonstrate that patients receiving this solution can live a more normal life with significantly reduced symptoms. Coloplast expects to begin pivotal studies in 2021, with the ambition to obtain pre-market approval for a Class III device in the US and EU market approvals in the 2024-2025 timeframe.

Today, +80 million people globally suffer from OAB symptoms. About 40% of the OAB patient population seek treatment and of those about 3 million patients globally are candidates for 3rd line therapies like the solution developed by Nine Continents.

The acquisition of Nine Continents and entry into the OAB segment fits with Coloplast’s strategy to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the Interventional Urology business and aligns with Coloplast’s mission and strategic direction to bring innovative solutions to the market.

“I am excited about the prospects of the Nine Continents device and pleased to confirm our commitment to the Interventional Urology business with this acquisition in the large OAB market. There is a large group of patients in the US and abroad suffering from OAB, and with Nine Continents’ innovative, minimally invasive device we hope to help these people live a better life,” says Kristian Villumsen, President and CEO of Coloplast.
The acquisition is debt financed using existing credit facilities, and Coloplast’s dividend policy is unchanged. The acquisition has no impact on Coloplast’s long-term guidance of 7-9% organic growth p.a. and more than 30% EBIT margin in constant currencies. Operational costs until commercialization are included in Coloplast’s annual incremental commercial investments of up to 2% of revenues.

Caution: Investigational Device. Not approved for sale in any jurisdiction.

51727,Merck to Acquire VelosBio for $2.75B,Merck to Acquire VelosBio,"Merck will acquire all the outstanding shares of VelosBio for $2.75B in cash. The transaction is expected to be closed by the end of 2020
 The acquisition will bolster Merck’s oncology pipeline with the addition of VelosBio’s VLS-101, which is an investigational ADC targeting ROR1 to treat hematological malignancies and solid tumors
 In Oct’2020, VelosBio has initiated P-II study to evaluate VLS-101 for the treatment of patients with solid tumors, including patients with TNBC, HR+/HER2+ BC, and NSCLC. Additionally, VelosBio is developing a preclinical pipeline of ADCs and bispecific Abs targeting ROR1 to complement VLS-101 by offering alternative methods of tumor cell killing","KENILWORTH, N.J. & SAN DIEGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and VelosBio Inc. today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all outstanding shares of VelosBio for $2.75 billion in cash, subject to certain customary adjustments. VelosBio is a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing first-in-class cancer therapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1). VelosBio’s lead investigational candidate is VLS-101, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting ROR1 that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, respectively.

“At Merck, we continue to bolster our growing oncology pipeline with strategic acquisitions that both complement our current portfolio and strengthen our long-term growth potential,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Pioneering work by VelosBio scientists has yielded VLS-101, which in early studies has provided notable evidence of activity in heavily pretreated patients with refractory hematological malignancies, including mantel cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.”

In October 2020, VelosBio announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04504916) to evaluate VLS-101 for the treatment of patients with solid tumors, including patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), hormone receptor-positive and/or HER2-positive breast cancer, and non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In early clinical trials, VLS-101 demonstrated a manageable safety profile and early signs of anti-tumor activity. Results of a Phase 1 clinical trial, to be presented virtually at the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting (Dec. 5-8, 2020), showed that VLS-101 resulted in objective clinical responses, including complete responses, in 47% (n=7/15) of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and 80% (n=4/5) of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients in this Phase 1 trial had been heavily pretreated with other anticancer medications, and their cancers had failed to respond or had relapsed after initially responding to these other anticancer medications. In addition, VelosBio is developing a preclinical pipeline of next-generation ADCs and bispecific antibodies targeting ROR1 with the potential to complement VLS-101 by offering alternative methods of tumor cell killing.

“Merck is a recognized leader in oncology, and this acquisition reflects the hard work and commitment of all the employees at VelosBio in advancing the science of ROR1,” said Dave Johnson, founder and chief executive officer at VelosBio. “We are very pleased that Merck has recognized the value of our first-in-class ROR1-directed investigational therapeutics. As part of Merck’s oncology pipeline, our lead product candidate, VLS-101, is now well positioned to achieve its maximum potential to benefit appropriate cancer patients in need.”

The closing of the transaction, which is subject to approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions, is expected by the end of 2020.

Merck was represented by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP as legal advisor and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as financial advisor. VelosBio was represented by Cooley LLP as legal advisor and Centerview Partners LLC as financial advisor.

About VLS-101

VLS-101 is an investigational ADC comprising a monoclonal antibody targeting ROR1 that is linked to a chemotherapeutic agent called monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). After the antibody binds to ROR1 on cancer cells, the ADC is designed to enter those cells and release MMAE to destroy the cancer cells. In mouse models of human hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, VLS-101 showed robust antitumor activity. VLS-101 is in clinical development for patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted VLS-101 orphan drug and fast track designations for the treatment of MCL.

51744,AstraZeneca's Forxiga (dapagliflozin) Receives EC's Approval for Heart Failure,Forxiga approved in the EU for heart failure,"The approval is based on P-III DAPA-HF study involves assessing of Forxiga (10mg) + SOC vs PBO +SOC in 4744 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%) with/out T2D
 Results: reduction in risk of the composite outcome by 26%, with both components of the 1EPs (first occurrence of a worsening HF event or CV death) contributed benefit to the overall effect.
 Forxiga is the first SGLT2 inhibitor approved in the EU for HFrEF in adult patients with/out T2D. The therapy is currently being evaluated for HFpEF in P-III DELIVER study with its anticipated results in H2’21","AstraZeneca’s Forxiga (dapagliflozin) has been approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in adults with and without type-2 diabetes (T2D).

Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening chronic disease that prevents the heart from pumping sufficient levels of blood around the body. It affects 15 million people in the EU, at least half of whom have a reduced ejection fraction,1-3 which occurs when the left ventricle muscle is not able to contract adequately and therefore expels less oxygen-rich blood into the body.4-6

The approval by the European Commission is based on positive results from the landmark DAPA-HF Phase III trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine.7 It follows the recommendation for approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency.

John McMurray, MD, Cardiovascular Research Centre, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK, said: “Today’s approval provides physicians with a completely novel treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, not only improving symptoms and reducing hospital admissions, but also increasing survival in this life-threatening condition.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “With this approval of Forxiga, we can redefine the standard of care for millions of people in the EU living with heart failure. We are another step closer to achieving our ambition of preventing or treating heart failure by providing a treatment that can significantly reduce cardiovascular death and hospitalisation.”

Forxiga is the first sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to have shown a statistically significant reduction in the risk of the composite of cardiovascular (CV) death or worsening of HF events, including hospitalisation for HF (hHF). The DAPA-HF Phase III trial demonstrated that Forxiga, in addition to standard of care, reduced the risk of the composite outcome versus placebo by 26% and both components of the primary composite endpoint contributed benefit to the overall effect. In the DAPA-HF Phase III trial, the safety profile of Forxiga was consistent with the well-established safety profile of the medicine. During the trial, one CV death or hHF or an urgent visit associated with HF could be avoided for every 21 patients treated.


Forxiga (known as Farxiga in the US) is approved in the US for the treatment of patients with HFrEF and is currently under review in Japan and in several over countries around the world.

Forxiga is advancing cardiorenal prevention as science continues to identify the underlying links between the heart, kidneys and pancreas. DAPA-HF is part of DapaCare, a robust clinical trial programme to assess the potential CV and renal benefits of Forxiga. The programme has also explored the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the ground-breaking DAPA-CKD Phase III trial. Additionally, Forxiga is currently being tested for HF patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the DELIVER Phase III trial with data anticipated in the second half of 2021.

Heart failure

HF affects approximately 64 million people worldwide (at least half of whom have a reduced ejection fraction), including 15 million in the EU and six million in the US.2-3,8 It is a chronic disease where half of patients will die within five years of diagnosis.9 There are two main categories of HF related to ejection fraction (EF), a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving the heart each time it contracts: HFrEF and HFpEF.7 HFrEF occurs when the left ventricle muscle is not able to contract adequately and therefore, expels less oxygen-rich blood in to the body.5,6 HF remains as fatal as some of the most common cancers in both men (prostate and bladder cancers) and women (breast cancer).10 It is the leading cause of hospitalisation for those over the age of 65 and represents a significant clinical and economic burden.11

DAPA-HF

DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure) is an international, multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised, double-blinded Phase III trial in 4,744 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%), with and without T2D, designed to evaluate the effect of Forxiga 10mg, compared with placebo, given once daily in addition to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint was time to the first occurrence of a worsening heart failure event (hospitalisation or equivalent event; i.e. an urgent heart failure visit), or cardiovascular death. The median duration of follow-up was 18.2 months.

Forxiga

Forxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction.

Forxiga has been evaluated in patients with CKD in the Phase III DAPA-CKD trial, with the full results announced in August 2020 demonstrating that Forxiga met all primary and secondary endpoints, providing overwhelming efficacy. Forxiga is currently being tested for patients with HF in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) Phase III trials. Forxiga will also be tested in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking, registry-based randomised controlled trial. Forxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

AstraZeneca in CVRM

Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism (CVRM) together forms one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company. By following the science to understand more clearly the underlying links between the heart, kidneys and pancreas, AstraZeneca is investing in a portfolio of medicines to protect organs and improve outcomes by slowing disease progression, reducing risks and tackling comorbidities.

51748,Merck KGaA Collaborates with Iktos to Deploy AI in New Drug Design,"Iktos Announces Additional Collaboration With Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany in AI for New Drug Design","Iktos will leverage its de novo generative design technology to be used in a structure-enabled context, facilitating the rapid & cost-effective design of Merck KGaA’s drug discovery program
 The collaboration follows the previous agreement of the companies signed in 2019. Merck KGaA is utilizing Iktos’ de novo design software platform Makya for MPO
 Iktos’ AI technology is based on deep generative models that help bring speed & efficiency to the drug discovery process by automatically designing virtual novel molecules having desired activities for treating a disease","PARIS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Iktos, a company specialized in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for new drug design, today announced an additional collaboration agreement in AI for new drug design with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a leading science and technology company. In this new collaboration, Iktos’ de novo generative design technology will be used in a structure-enabled context to facilitate the rapid and cost-effective design of an undisclosed Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany drug discovery program.

Iktos’ AI technology, based on deep generative models, helps bring speed and efficiency to the drug discovery process, by automatically designing virtual novel molecules that have desired activities for treating a given disease. This tackles one of the key challenges in drug design: rapid identification of molecules which simultaneously satisfy multiple bioactivity and drug-like criteria for drug discovery and development. In the context of the new collaboration, Iktos’ generative AI technology will be combined with structure-based modelling, with an iterative design of structures maximizing protein-ligand interaction, enabling identification of novel structures beyond the chemical space already explored in the project.

“AI has the potential to improve and accelerate the drug discovery process, which could mean faster access to novel treatment options for patients,” said Joern-Peter Halle, Global Head of Research for the Healthcare business sector of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. “This additional collaboration with Iktos illustrates our commitment to partnerships to access the latest technology to enrich our discovery engine.”

“We are thrilled to enter into this additional collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany following on the announcement of the initial collaboration in 2019,” commented Yann Gaston-Mathé, President and CEO of Iktos. “We are proud to have earned the trust of our collaborators and hope to demonstrate further value for Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany’s project with the application of our structure-guided generative AI technology. Merck’s scientists are already using our de novo design software platform Makya™ for Multi Parameter Optimization (MPO) and their feedback is highly valuable in guiding us to improve our product and better address the market’s needs.”

Iktos has emerged in the last 3 years as a world leader in AI for drug design. In 2018, Iktos was the first AI company to publish an experimental validation of the generative AI technology for MPO in a real-life drug discovery project, and since then has announced collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies. Iktos markets its AI technology both as services and as software products. Iktos’ generative AI SaaS software, Makya™, has been deployed to several customers, and Spaya™, Iktos’ retro-synthesis AI SaaS platform, which has been accessible on the Web since March 2020, is currently being deployed as a custom version within the collaborator’s IT infrastructure.

51754,AstraZeneca and MSD's Lynparza (olaparib) Receive EU's Approval as 1L Maintenance Treatment for HRD-Positive Advanced Ovarian Cancer,Lynparza approved in the EU as 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer,"The approval is based on a biomarker subgroup analysis of P-III PAOLA-1 study assessing Lynparza + bevacizumab vs bevacizumab alone as 1L maintenance treatment in patients with newly diagnosed advanced FIGO Stage III-IV high-grade serous/ endometrioid ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal cancer who had CR/PR to 1L treatment with Pt. based CT and bevacizumab
 Results: reduction in risk of disease progression or death by 67%, PFS (37.2mos. vs 17.7mos.); PFS2 (50.3mos. vs 35.3mos.)
 Following the approval, AZ will receive $25M as a regulatory milestone from MSD. The approval follows the CHMP’s positive opinion granted in Sept’2020","AstraZeneca and MSD’s Lynparza (olaparib) has been approved in the European Union (EU) for the 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab of patients with homologous recombination deficient (HRD)-positive advanced ovarian cancer.

Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the EU and the five-year survival rate is approximately 45%, due partly because women are often diagnosed with advanced disease (Stage III or IV).1-3

The approval by the European Commission was based on a biomarker subgroup analysis of the PAOLA-1 Phase III trial which showed Lynparza, in combination with bevacizumab maintenance treatment, demonstrated a substantial progression-free survival (PFS) improvement versus bevacizumab alone for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer. It follows the recommendation for approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency in September 2020.

Isabelle Ray-Coquard, principal investigator of the PAOLA-1 Phase III trial and medical oncologist, Centre Léon Bérard and President of the GINECO group, Paris, France, said: “For women with advanced ovarian cancer, the goal of 1st-line treatment is to delay disease progression for as long as possible with the intent of achieving long-term remission. Unfortunately, once a patient’s cancer recurs, it historically has been incurable. Lynparza together with bevacizumab has demonstrated an impressive median progression-free survival benefit of more than three years and is poised to become the standard of care for eligible patients with HRD-positive tumours in the EU.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Half of all newly diagnosed patients with advanced ovarian cancer have HRD-positive tumours. Women treated with Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab in the PAOLA-1 Phase III trial lived progression free for a median of more than three years, showing that HRD testing should be an essential component of clinical diagnosis. HRD status can help physicians select a personalised 1st-line treatment regimen for patients to substantially delay relapse in this devastating disease.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “Biomarker testing has rapidly enhanced our understanding of how PARP inhibition can help target this disease. The EU approval reinforces that HRD-positive tumours represent a distinct subset of advanced ovarian cancer and HRD testing is critical for women in this setting.”

The PAOLA-1 Phase III trial showed that Lynparza, in combination with bevacizumab maintenance treatment, reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 67% (based on a hazard ratio of 0.33; 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.45). The addition of Lynparza improved PFS to a median of 37.2 months versus 17.7 with bevacizumab alone in patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer. The data from the PAOLA-1 trial was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2019.

Further results recently presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual Congress 2020 showed a statistically significant improvement in the key secondary endpoint of the time to second disease progression (PFS2). Lynparza with bevacizumab provided benefit beyond first disease progression, improving PFS2 to a median of 50.3 months versus 35.3 with bevacizumab alone.

The full EU indication is for Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and whose cancer is associated with HRD positive status defined by either a breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) mutation and/or genomic instability.

Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab is approved in the US and in several other countries as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer and is currently under regulatory review in other countries around the world.

Financial considerations

Following this approval for Lynparza in the EU, AstraZeneca will receive a regulatory milestone payment from MSD of $25m, anticipated to be booked as collaboration revenue during the fourth quarter of 2020.

Ovarian cancer

In 2018, there were nearly 68,000 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in the EU and around 45,000 deaths.3 Approximately 50% of ovarian cancers are HRD-positive including BRCA1/2 mutation.4,5 Approximately 15% of ovarian cancers have a BRCA1/2 mutation.6 The primary aim of 1st-line treatment is to delay disease progression for as long as possible with the intent to achieve long-term remission.7-9

Homologous recombination deficiency

HRD, which defines a subgroup of ovarian cancer, encompasses a wide range of genetic abnormalities, including BRCA mutations and beyond. As with BRCA gene mutations, HRD interferes with normal cell DNA repair mechanisms and confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitors including Lynparza.10

PAOLA-1

PAOLA-1 is a double-blinded Phase III trial testing the efficacy and safety of Lynparza added to standard-of-care bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone, as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for newly diagnosed advanced FIGO Stage III-IV high-grade serous or endometroid ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer patients who had a complete or partial response to 1st-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. AstraZeneca and MSD announced in August 2019 that the trial met its primary endpoint of PFS in the overall trial population.

Lynparza

Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.

Lynparza is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer (BRCAm and/or genomic instability). Lynparza is approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. It is also approved in the US, the EU and several other countries for the treatment of germline BRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US for homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (BRCAm and other HRR gene mutations). Regulatory reviews are underway in several countries for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.

The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and Koselugo (selumetinib), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

AstraZeneca in oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

AstraZeneca

In the coming years, many of these biotech drugs will lose their patent protection – and by 2020, medications with revenues of approximately USD 100 billion will be off patent. Biosimilars are follow-on versions of biopharmaceuticals, for which exclusivity has expired. They are approved via stringent regulatory pathways in highly regulated markets (such as EU, US, Japan, Canada, Australia) based on proven similarity of the biosimilar with the originator biopharmaceutical reference product. In 2019, global sales of biosimilars exceeded USD12 billion. Analysts estimate that this figure could rise to around USD 69 billion by 2025.

51777,AstraZeneca's Brilinta (ticagrelor) Receives the US FDA's Approval to Reduce the Risk of Stroke in Patients with an Acute Ischemic Stroke or High-Risk Transient Ischemic Attack,Brilinta approved in the US to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with an acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk transient ischaemic attack,"The approval is based on P-III THALES study involves assessing Brilinta (180mg as a loading dose followed by 90mg, bid) + aspirin vs aspirin as monothx. in 11,000 patients with non-cardioembolic acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA for 30days
 Results demonstrated a reduction in the rate of the composite 1EP of stroke & death by 17%, risk of severe bleeding events (0.5% vs 0.1%). Regulatory submissions to expand the approved indication are under regulatory review in China and the EU
 Brilinta (ticagrelor) is an oral, reversible, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist that works by inhibiting platelet activation. The approval follows the US FDA’s PR designation granted in Jul’2020","AstraZeneca’s Brilinta (ticagrelor) has been approved in the US to reduce the risk of stroke, a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, in patients with acute ischemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≤5) or high-risk transient ischaemic attack (TIA).

The approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on positive results from the THALES Phase III trial that showed aspirin plus Brilinta 90mg significantly reduced the rate of the composite of stroke and death compared to aspirin alone in patients with acute ischaemic stroke or TIA.1 The decision follows the Priority Review designation granted by the FDA in July 2020.

Dr. Clay Johnston, lead investigator for the THALES Phase III trial and Dean of the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas in Austin, US, said: “One in four patients who have had a stroke will experience a second one, with the risk particularly high within the first 30 days. The approval of Brilinta in combination with aspirin is an important advancement to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and much-awaited good news for physicians and patients.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “In the US, someone has a stroke every 40 seconds and the impact on a person’s life can be truly devastating. Brilinta is a well-established medicine across patients with coronary artery disease and with today’s approval, we can now expand its potential to patients with an acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.”

The THALES trial demonstrated that Brilinta 90mg used twice daily and taken with daily aspirin for 30 days, reduced the rate of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death by 17% (absolute risk reduction = 1.1%; hazard ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.71-0.96, p=0.015), compared to aspirin alone in patients with an acute ischemic stroke or TIA.1 This was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction. The primary composite endpoint was driven by a reduction in stroke.

The risk for severe bleeding events was 0.5% in patients receiving aspirin plus Brilinta and 0.1% for aspirin alone. The results were in line with the known safety profile of Brilinta.1 Full data from the THALES Phase III trial can be found in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Regulatory submissions to expand the approved indication are also under regulatory review in China and in the EU where the medicine’s name is Brilique.

Brilinta is approved in more than 110 countries for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in more than 70 countries for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among patients who are at high-risk and have experienced a heart attack. In May 2020, the US FDA approved a new indication for Brilinta to include the reduction of the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease.

Stroke

An ischaemic stroke is caused by a blockage cutting off the blood supply to a region of the brain. A transient ischaemic attack, is a temporary blockage of the blood supply to a region of the brain, resulting in symptoms only lasting for a short amount of time. Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide.2 In the US, someone has a stroke every 40 seconds, and every four minutes, someone dies of stroke.3 About one in four strokes are recurrent, with the risk particularly high within 30 days after the initial event and even higher when looking at time periods closer to the initial event.4,5

THALES

THALES is an AstraZeneca-sponsored, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, international, multicentre, event-driven Phase III trial involving more than 11,000 patients from 28 countries. It tested the hypothesis whether aspirin plus Brilinta is superior to aspirin alone in preventing the composite of stroke and death in patients with non-cardioembolic acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA. Patients were randomised within 24 hours of onset of acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA symptoms and treated for 30 days. Study treatments were Brilinta 180mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 90mg twice daily on days 2-30, or matching placebo. All patients received open-label aspirin 300-325mg on day 1, followed by 75-100mg once daily on days 2-30. The primary efficacy outcome was the time to the composite endpoint of stroke and death at 30 days. The primary safety outcome is time to first severe bleeding event according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) definition, which includes fatal bleedings, intracranial haemorrhage; and bleeding causing hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention.

Brilinta

Brilinta (ticagrelor) is an oral, reversible, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist that works by inhibiting platelet activation. Brilinta, together with aspirin, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (heart attack, stroke or CV death), in patients with ACS or a history of heart attack. In the US, Brilinta is also indicated for the reduction of the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease.

About Aducanumab

Aducanumab (BIIB037) is an investigational human monoclonal antibody studied for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Based on clinical data from patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease, aducanumab has the potential to impact underlying disease pathophysiology, slow cognitive and functional decline and provide benefits on patients’ ability to perform activities of daily living, including conducting personal finances, performing household chores, such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry, and independently traveling out of the home. If approved, aducanumab would be the first treatment to meaningfully change the course of the disease for individuals living with Alzheimer’s.

Biogen licensed aducanumab from Neurimmune under a collaborative development and license agreement. Since October 2017 Biogen and Eisai have collaborated on the development and commercialization of aducanumab globally.

About Aducanumab’s Clinical Program

EMERGE and ENGAGE were Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab. Enrolled patients had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 24-30. The primary objective of the studies was to evaluate the efficacy of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared with placebo in reducing cognitive and functional impairment as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared to placebo on clinical decline as measured by the MMSE, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 Items (ADAS-Cog 13) and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory Mild Cognitive Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-MCI).

PRIME was a Phase 1b randomized, multicenter study that included a 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled period followed by a dose-blinded long-term extension period. Enrolled patients had prodromal Alzheimer’s disease or mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia with MMSE scores of 20-30. The safety and tolerability of aducanumab was the primary aim of the study. Secondary outcomes were: (1) the effect of aducanumab on brain amyloid plaque content as measured by [18F]-florbetapir PET, (2) the pharmacokinetics of aducanumab and (3) the immunogenicity of aducanumab. Clinical efficacy endpoints were prespecified in the study protocol as exploratory.

About Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that impairs thinking, memory and independence, leading to premature death. The disease currently cannot be stopped, delayed or prevented and is a growing global health crisis, affecting those living with the disease and their families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tens of millions of people worldwide live with Alzheimer’s disease, and the number will grow in the years ahead, outpacing the healthcare resources needed to manage it and costing billions of dollars.

Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by changes in the brain, including the abnormal accumulation of toxic amyloid beta plaque, which begins approximately 20 years before patients exhibit symptoms of the disease. Mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease is one of the earliest stages of the disease when symptoms start to be more visible and can be detected and diagnosed. Current research efforts are focused on catching and treating patients as early as possible for the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

51818,Eisai Reports Results of Lenvima (lenvatinib) + Everolimus in P-II 218 Study for Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,Eisai Announces New Investigational Data Evaluating TKI-mTOR Inhibitor Regimen LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) Plus Everolimus in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) at IKCS 2020,"The P-II 218 study involves assessing Lenvima (14mg, qd) + everolimus (5mg, qd) vs Lenvima (18mg, qd) + everolimus (5mg qd) in patients with clear-cell RCC, following treatment with an anti-angiogenic therapy, with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy permitted
 In the primary analysis, @24wks. ORR (32.1% vs 34.8%) i.e. lower dose did not meet the threshold for non-inferiority; Grade 2/ any ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs (82.8% vs 79.6%); discontinuation (32.4% vs 26.8%); dose interruption (74.6% vs 83.3%); dose reductions (67.6% vs 69.6%)
 Overall ORR (34.6% vs 40.6%); mPFS (11.1 vs 14.7mos.); m-OS (27.0 vs NE). Results were presented at IKCS 2020","WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., Nov. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eisai announced results from Study 218, a Phase 2 trial comparing the safety and efficacy of two different starting doses (18 mg versus 14 mg once daily) of LENVIMA, an orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovered by Eisai, plus everolimus (5 mg once daily) in patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following treatment with an anti-angiogenic therapy, with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy permitted, during an oral presentation at the International Kidney Cancer Symposium (IKCS) 2020. Results indicate that the lower starting dose (14 mg) of LENVIMA did not meet the threshold for non-inferiority compared to the FDA-approved starting dose (18 mg).

“With the influx of options for patients in the advanced RCC space, it is important that we continue to evaluate data in order to determine the most effective course of action that may help maximize therapeutic effects while managing tolerability for patients,” said Sumanta Pal, MD, Co-director of the Kidney Cancer Program and clinical professor, Department of Medical Oncology & Therapeutics at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, Calif., and lead investigator of the study. “The results from Study 218 show the potential benefit of LENVIMA plus everolimus in patients with advanced RCC, while providing a similar safety profile seen in previous studies.”

The objective of this randomized, open-label, Phase 2 trial (NCT03173560) was to assess whether a starting dose of LENVIMA 14 mg once daily plus everolimus 5 mg once daily would provide similar efficacy with an improved safety profile compared to the FDA-approved dosage of LENVIMA 18 mg once daily plus everolimus 5 mg once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was noninferiority of LENVIMA 14 mg versus 18 mg for objective response rate (ORR) at Week 24 (ORRWK24) (odds ratio: >0.76; P-value: ≤ 0.045) based on investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The primary safety endpoint was superiority of the proportion of patients with intolerable Grade 2 or any ≥ Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 24 weeks after randomization in the 14 mg versus 18 mg treatment arms. Some key secondary endpoints included overall ORR, progression-free survival (PFS) overall survival (OS) and safety. The study enrolled 343 patients.

In the primary efficacy analysis (n=311 patients), ORR at week 24 for patients treated with LENVIMA at the lower starting dose (14 mg) was not non-inferior to ORR at week 24 for patients treated with the approved starting dose (18 mg) (odds ratioORRWK24: 0.88 [90% CI: 0.59-1.32]; P-value: 0.2676). ORR at Week 24 for patients starting with 14 mg and 18 mg was 32.1% (95% CI: 24.7-39.4) and 34.8% (95% CI: 27.3-42.3), respectively. In the primary safety analysis (n=309), the occurrence of intolerable Grade 2 or any ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs was similar between the 14 mg and 18 mg treatment arms: 82.8% vs. 79.6% (P-value: 0.4763), respectively. The 18 mg starting dose of LENVIMA plus everolimus 5 mg demonstrated a similar safety profile as seen in a previous Phase 2 trial (Study 205). In the full safety analysis set (all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug, n=341), TEAEs led to:

discontinuation in 32.4% vs. 26.8% of patients who received LENVIMA 14 mg and 18 mg, respectively;
dose interruption in 74.6% vs. 83.3% of patients who received LENVIMA 14 mg and 18 mg, respectively; and
dose reductions in 67.6% vs. 69.6% of patients who received LENVIMA 14 mg and 18 mg, respectively.
Overall ORR (based on the primary efficacy analysis set of n=311) for patients starting with 14 mg and 18 mg of LENVIMA was 34.6% (95% CI: 27.1-42.1) and 40.6% (95% CI: 32.9-48.4), respectively (odds ratio: 0.77 [90% CI: 0.52-1.14]). Median PFS and median OS indicated a numerical benefit for patients treated with LENVIMA at 18 mg compared to LENVIMA at 14 mg:

Median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI: 9.0-12.9) for patients treated with 14 mg vs. 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.1-20.3) for patients treated with 18 mg; and
Median OS was 27.0 months (95% CI: 18.3-NE) for patients treated with 14 mg vs. NE (95% CI: 23.8-NE) for patients treated with 18 mg.
Some of the most common any-grade TEAEs (≥ 20%) across the 14 mg and 18 mg treatment arms included diarrhea (68.2% vs. 72.0%), hypertension (30.1% vs. 35.7%), proteinuria (22.5% vs. 35.7%), decreased appetite (35.3% vs. 34.5%), and nausea (30.6% vs. 31.0%). Serious TEAEs (≥ 2%) occurred in 49.1% of patients who received LENVIMA 14 mg and 48.8% of patients who received LENVIMA 18 mg.

“This research demonstrates our commitment to advancing our understanding of our oncology compounds and generates key insights for the medical community to help inform treatment decisions around dosing,” said Dr. Corina Dutcus, Vice President of Clinical Research for the Oncology Business Group at Eisai. “This study, in which 343 patients received LENVIMA plus everolimus, helps to contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of this TKI-mTOR combination in the advanced RCC treatment paradigm.”

Study 218 was conducted as a post-marketing commitment to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) following priority review designation (in the U.S.) and approval of LENVIMA plus everolimus for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC who were previously treated with an anti-angiogenic therapy. LENVIMA is marketed as KISPLYX® in the European Union and Switzerland for this indication.

In March 2018, Eisai and Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), through an affiliate, entered into a strategic collaboration for the worldwide co-development and co-commercialization of LENVIMA.

About Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)

Worldwide, it is estimated there were more than 403,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and more than 175,000 deaths from the disease in 2018. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated there will be nearly 74,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and almost 15,000 deaths from the disease in 2020. Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancers are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men as in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. Approximately 30% of patients with RCC will have metastatic disease at diagnosis, and as many as 40% will develop metastases after primary surgical treatment for localized RCC. Survival is highly dependent on the stage at diagnosis, and with a 5-year survival rate of 12% for metastatic disease, the prognosis for these patients is poor.

About LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) Capsules

LENVIMA is indicated:

For the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-refractory DTC)
In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy
For the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
In combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy, and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial
LENVIMA, discovered and developed by Eisai, is a kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, lenvatinib decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone. The combination of LENVIMA and everolimus showed increased anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity as demonstrated by decreased human endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signaling in vitro and tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer greater than each drug alone.

Important Safety Information

Warnings and Precautions

Hypertension. In DTC, hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In RCC, hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients, and 21% had diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg. In HCC, hypertension occurred in 45% of LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in HCC.

Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC, and HCC, grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity

Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials. Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months.

Hepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1,327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events, including hepatic failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of patients. In HCC, hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients (5% grade 3-5). Grade 3-5 hepatic failure occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. 2% of patients discontinued LENVIMA due to hepatic encephalopathy and 1% discontinued due to hepatic failure.

Monitor liver function prior to initiation, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Monitor patients with HCC closely for signs of hepatic failure, including hepatic encephalopathy. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Renal Failure or Impairment. Serious including fatal renal failure or impairment can occur with LENVIMA. Renal impairment was reported in 14% and 7% of LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, respectively. Grade 3-5 renal failure or impairment occurred in 3% of patients with DTC and 2% of patients with HCC, including 1 fatal event in each study. In RCC, renal impairment or renal failure was reported in 18% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (10% grade 3).

Initiate prompt management of diarrhea or dehydration/hypovolemia. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue for renal failure or impairment based on severity.

Proteinuria. In DTC and HCC, proteinuria was reported in 34% and 26% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 11% and 6% in DTC and HCC, respectively. In RCC, proteinuria occurred in 31% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus (8% grade 3). Monitor for proteinuria prior to initiation and periodically during treatment. If urine dipstick proteinuria ≥2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%. Permanently discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any severity or grade 3-4 fistula.

QT Interval Prolongation. In DTC, QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of >500 ms occurred in 2%. In RCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 11% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 6%. In HCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%.

Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity.

Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus– treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity.

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome. Across clinical studies of 1,823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.

Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.

Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.

Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.

Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.

Embryo-fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 30 days after the last dose.

About COVID-191,2

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of viruses that lead to illnesses from the common cold to severe diseases. Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the disease COVID-19, this new strain, discovered in 2019, is behind the ongoing pandemic outbreak.

The most common signs of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough and tiredness; however, people may also experience other symptoms including shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Most people infected with the virus will exhibit mild to moderate symptoms however older people, and those with existing underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are more likely to develop a more severe form of COVID-19.

Please find up to date information about the outbreak via the World Health Organization at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1

About CT-P59

CT-P59 was identified as a potential treatment for COVID-19 through screening of antibody candidates and selecting those that showed the highest potency in neutralising the SARS-CoV-2 virus including the mutated G-variant strain (D614G variant). In pre-clinical data the treatment candidate demonstrated a 100-fold reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2, as well as a reduction in lung inflammation.3

51861,Novartis' Ilaris (canakinumab) Fails to Meet its Primary Endpoints in P-lll Study for COVID-19 Pneumonia and CRS,Novartis provides update on CAN-COVID trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS),"The P-lll CAN-COVID trial involves assessing Ilaris (canakinumab) + SOC vs PBO + SoC in 454 patients aged 18-98yrs. with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome CRS, with its expected full results in early 2021
 Result: The trial fails to meet its 1EPs of survival without the need for mechanical ventilation up to day29 (88.8% vs 85.7%) and did not meet its 2EPs of COVID-19-related mortality up to 4 wks. (4.9% vs 7.2%)
 Canakinumab is mAb that binds to and neutralizes (IL-1β), blocking its action. Additionally, P-III trial for ruxolitinib in COVID-19 is ongoing, with preliminary results expected by end of 2020","Basel, November 6, 2020 — Novartis today announced new data from an interim analysis for the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CAN-COVID trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)6. The ongoing trial failed to meet its primary endpoint showing that treatment with canakinumab plus standard of care (SoC) did not demonstrate a significantly greater chance of survival for patients without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, compared with placebo plus SoC up to Day 291. The trial did not meet its key secondary endpoint of reducing the COVID-19-related death rate during the 4-week period after treatment1. The safety profiles of canakinumab plus SoC and placebo plus SoC were comparable1.

“Though the CAN-COVID trial did not show the patient benefit we were hoping for, it helps improve the scientific understanding of COVID-19 and the role of interleukin-1β inhibition,” said John Tsai, M.D., Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer for Novartis. “There’s still an urgent need for effective ways to combat COVID-19 and we will continue to apply our best scientific minds in support of the global pandemic response, including a Phase III trial of ruxolitinib. We’re deeply grateful to the patients who participated and their caregivers, as well as the healthcare professionals and hospital staff who made this research possible while fighting the pandemic on the front line.”

In the trial, the primary endpoint of survival without the need for mechanical ventilation was 88.8% for canakinumab plus SoC vs 85.7% for placebo plus SoC (P=0.29)1. The key secondary endpoint of COVID-19-related mortality up to 4 weeks was 4.9% for canakinumab plus SoC vs 7.2% for placebo plus SoC (P=0.33)1. Both the primary and key secondary endpoints trended in favor of canakinumab but did not reach statistical significance1. No new safety signals for canakinumab were identified1.

This interim analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks. The CAN-COVID results do not affect any other ongoing trials for canakinumab, including investigations for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)7-9.

As part of its continued efforts to support the global pandemic response, Novartis in October announced a collaboration with Switzerland-based Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-194. In addition, a Phase III trial for ruxolitinib in COVID-19 is ongoing, with preliminary results expected by year end5.

About CAN-COVID
CAN-COVID is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of canakinumab plus standard of care (SoC) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)6. Patients were hypoxic but not requiring intubation or invasive mechanical ventilation6. The primary endpoint was to demonstrate the benefit of canakinumab plus SoC vs placebo plus SoC in increasing the chance of survival without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation up to Day 296. The key secondary endpoint was to reduce the COVID-19-related death rate during the 4-week period after trial treatment6. The trial enrolled 454 patients at multiple centers across the US, Russia and Europe1. Both endpoints were analyzed at Day 296. The average age of trial participants was 58 years old, ranging from 18 to 98 years old1. Approximately 30% were Hispanic or Latino, 16% were Black or African American and 4% were Asian1. Interim analysis of Day 29 results is available. The trial is ongoing (to Day 127) with full results expected in early 20216.

About canakinumab
Canakinumab is biologic medicine used in the treatment of a number of rare, debilitating auto-inflammatory diseases, for which there are limited options available. It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), blocking its action2,3,10. Excessive production of IL-1β plays a prominent role in certain inflammatory diseases and immune responses11,12. Canakinumab is an established medicine approved under the trade name Ilaris® in approximately 60 countries including the US, Europe and others. It is indicated for rare conditions including periodic fever syndromes, adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA)2,3. First approved in 2009, canakinumab has been proven to be highly effective and well tolerated as a treatment option for its approved indications based on previously reported clinical trials2,3. As well as being studied in severe COVID-19, canakinumab is also being investigated for the treatment of a number of other diseases involving inflammation, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)7–9.

Novartis response to COVID-19 pandemic
Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis is active in several key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)13. Novartis has also announced a collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19, and the company is separately supporting COVID-19-related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines4. We continue with the Phase III trial for ruxolitinib, another Novartis medicine, in collaboration with Incyte5. Preliminary results from this trial are expected by year end. Two medicines in early stage development are also being investigated focusing on stopping or slowing the body’s overactive immune response to COVID-1914, 15. In our labs, we have started a collaborative, longer-term drug discovery effort to develop an antiviral molecule to potentially treat all coronaviruses. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low- and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is found. This includes dexamethasone, which is the only medicine shown to decrease mortality so far in severe hospitalized COVID pneumonia13. Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID16.

51875,AstraZeneca's Calquence (acalabrutinib) Receives EU's Approval for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia,Calquence approved in the EU for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"The approval is based on P-lll ELEVATE-TN study assessing Calquence + obinutuzumab or Calquence alone vs obinutuzumab + CT in patients with previously untreated CLL and ASCEND study assessing Calquence vs rituximab + idelalisib/ bendamustine in patients with r/r CLL
 ELEVATE-TN results: a reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (90% and 80%). ASCEND results: patients remained alive and free from disease progression @12mos. (88% vs 68%)
 Calquence is a selective inhibitor of BTK, binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity. The approval follows CHMP’s recommendation received in Jul’2020","AstraZeneca’s Calquence (acalabrutinib), a next-generation selective Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, has been approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most common type of leukaemia in adults.

The approval by the European Commission was based on positive results from two Phase III clinical trials, ELEVATE-TN in patients with previously untreated CLL and ASCEND in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL.1,2 This follows a recommendation for approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency in July 2020.

Paolo Ghia, MD, Director, Strategic Research Program on CLL, Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, and investigator of the ASCEND Phase III trial, said: “One of our biggest hurdles in treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is finding tolerable treatment options that manage the disease long term, which typically impacts older patients with comorbidities. Today’s news marks great progress for patients in Europe, as the Phase III clinical trials for Calquence showed a significant improvement in comparison with current standard treatments.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “This approval represents a key development for patients in Europe who until now have had limited chemotherapy-free treatment options. As our first European approval in blood cancers, Calquence provides a new tolerable treatment option with uncompromised efficacy and the potential to positively impact the quality of life for thousands of patients living with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.”

In the ELEVATE-TN Phase III trial, Calquence combined with obinutuzumab and as monotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 90% and 80%, respectively, compared with standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, in patients with previously untreated CLL.1 In the ASCEND Phase III trial, 88% of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL taking Calquence remained alive and free from disease progression after 12 months compared with 68% of patients on rituximab combined with idelalisib or bendamustine.2 Data from the interim results of the trials were published in The Lancet and Journal of Clinical Oncology, respectively.

Calquence is approved for the treatment of CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma in the US and is approved for CLL in several other countries worldwide. Calquence is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy in the US and several other countries. Calquence is not currently approved for the treatment of MCL in Europe.

As part of a broad development programme, Calquence is being assessed in more than 20 AstraZeneca-sponsored clinical trials for the treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM), follicular lymphoma (FL), and other haematologic malignancies.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukaemia in adults, with an estimated 105,000 new cases globally in 2016, and the number of people living with CLL is expected to grow with improved treatment as patients live longer with the disease.3,4,5,6 In CLL, too many blood stem cells in the bone marrow become abnormal lymphocytes and these abnormal cells have difficulty fighting infections. As the number of abnormal cells grows there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This could result in anaemia, infection, and bleeding.4 B-cell receptor signalling through BTK is one of the essential growth pathways for CLL.

ELEVATE-TN

ELEVATE-TN (ACE-CL-007) was a randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Calquence in combination with obinutuzumab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody, or Calquence alone versus chlorambucil, a chemotherapy, in combination with obinutuzumab in previously untreated patients with CLL. Patients 65 years of age or older, or between 18 and 65 years of age with a total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale >6 or creatinine clearance of 30 to 69mL/min, were enrolled. In the trial, 535 patients were randomised (1:1:1) into three arms. Patients in the first arm received chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the second arm received Calquence (100mg approximately every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the third arm received Calquence monotherapy (100mg approximately every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).1

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the Calquence and obinutuzumab arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm, assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), and a key secondary endpoint was IRC-assessed PFS in the Calquence monotherapy arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm. Other secondary endpoints included objective response rate, time to next treatment and overall survival (OS).1

ASCEND

ASCEND (ACE-CL-309) was a global, randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of Calquence in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. In the trial, 310 patients were randomised (1:1) into two arms. Patients in the first arm received Calquence monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity). Patients in the second arm received investigator’s choice of either rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody, in combination with idelalisib, a PI3K inhibitor, or rituximab in combination with bendamustine, a chemotherapy.2

The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by an IRC, and key secondary endpoints included physician-assessed PFS, IRC- and physician-assessed overall response rate and duration of response, as well as OS, patient-reported outcomes and time to next treatment.2

Calquence

Calquence (acalabrutinib) is a next-generation, selective inhibitor of BTK. Calquence binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.7,8 In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.7

51882,Pfizer and BioNTech's BNT162b2 Demonstrates 90% Efficacy in Preventing COVID-19,PFIZER AND BIONTECH ANNOUNCE VACCINE CANDIDATE AGAINST COVID-19 ACHIEVED SUCCESS IN FIRST INTERIM ANALYSIS FROM PHASE 3 STUDY,"The BNT162b2 showed more than 90% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 in participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first interim efficacy analysis, conducted on Nov 8, 2020 from P-III clinical study
 The companies reported no serious safety concerns so far while safety and additional efficacy data continues to be collected. The company expect to seek US’ EUA in the third week of Nov’2020
 The companies will continue the clinical trial for final analysis at 164 confirmed cases in order to collect further data and characterize the vaccine candidate’s performance against other study endpoints and plan to submit data from the full P-I trial for scientific peer-review publication","NEW YORK & MAINZ, GERMANY–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced their mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, against SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated evidence of efficacy against COVID-19 in participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on the first interim efficacy analysis conducted on November 8, 2020 by an external, independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) from the Phase 3 clinical study.

After discussion with the FDA, the companies recently elected to drop the 32-case interim analysis and conduct the first interim analysis at a minimum of 62 cases. Upon the conclusion of those discussions, the evaluable case count reached 94 and the DMC performed its first analysis on all cases. The case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates a vaccine efficacy rate above 90%, at 7 days after the second dose. This means that protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the vaccination, which consists of a 2-dose schedule. As the study continues, the final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. The DMC has not reported any serious safety concerns and recommends that the study continue to collect additional safety and efficacy data as planned. The data will be discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide.

“Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO. “We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen. With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis. We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks.”After discussion with the FDA, the companies recently elected to drop the 32-case interim analysis and conduct the first interim analysis at a minimum of 62 cases. Upon the conclusion of those discussions, the evaluable case count reached 94 and the DMC performed its first analysis on all cases. The case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates a vaccine efficacy rate above 90%, at 7 days after the second dose. This means that protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the vaccination, which consists of a 2-dose schedule. As the study continues, the final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. The DMC has not reported any serious safety concerns and recommends that the study continue to collect additional safety and efficacy data as planned. The data will be discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide.

“I want to thank the thousands of people who volunteered to participate in the clinical trial, our academic collaborators and investigators at the study sites, and our colleagues and collaborators around the world who are dedicating their time to this crucial endeavor,” added Bourla. “We could not have come this far without the tremendous commitment of everyone involved.”

“The first interim analysis of our global Phase 3 study provides evidence that a vaccine may effectively prevent COVID-19. This is a victory for innovation, science and a global collaborative effort,” said Prof. Ugur Sahin, BioNTech co-founder and CEO. “When we embarked on this journey 10 months ago this is what we aspired to achieve. Especially today, while we are all in the midst of a second wave and many of us in lockdown, we appreciate even more how important this milestone is on our path towards ending this pandemic and for all of us to regain a sense of normality. We will continue to collect further data as the trial continues to enroll for a final analysis planned when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to make this important achievement possible.”

The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27 and has enrolled 43,538 participants to date, 38,955 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 8, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The trial is continuing to enroll and is expected to continue through the final analysis when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the primary efficacy endpoints evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accruing from 7 days after the second dose, the final analysis now will include, with the approval of the FDA, new secondary endpoints evaluating efficacy based on cases accruing 14 days after the second dose as well. The companies believe that the addition of these secondary endpoints will help align data across all COVID-19 vaccine studies and allow for cross-trial learnings and comparisons between these novel vaccine platforms. The companies have posted an updated version of the study protocol at https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus.

Pfizer and BioNTech are continuing to accumulate safety data and currently estimate that a median of two months of safety data following the second (and final) dose of the vaccine candidate – the amount of safety data specified by the FDA in its guidance for potential Emergency Use Authorization – will be available by the third week of November. Additionally, participants will continue to be monitored for long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose.

Along with the efficacy data generated from the clinical trial, Pfizer and BioNTech are working to prepare the necessary safety and manufacturing data to submit to the FDA to demonstrate the safety and quality of the vaccine product produced.

Based on current projections we expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-review publication.

 Patients showed reduced viral load & rates of symptoms & hospitalization. The EUA includes a warning for hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions
 The US government will allocate 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab to high-risk patients, with no out-of-pocket costs for the medication. Bamlanivimab should be administered asap after a positive COVID-19 test and within 10 days of symptom onset","INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 700 mg. Bamlanivimab is authorized for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with a positive COVID-19 test, who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. Bamlanivimab should be administered as soon as possible after a positive COVID-19 test and within 10 days of symptom onset. The authorization allows for the distribution and emergency use of bamlanivimab, which is administered via a single intravenous infusion.

“This emergency authorization allows us to make bamlanivimab available as a COVID-19 treatment for recently diagnosed, high-risk patients – adding a valuable tool for doctors fighting the now-increasing burden of this global pandemic,” said David A. Ricks, Lilly’s chairman and CEO. “The rapid development and availability of bamlanivimab could not have been achieved without the relentless work of our Lilly team, collaboration across the industry and the urgent work being done by the government to ensure appropriate allocation to patients who need it the most.”

The EUA is based on data from BLAZE-1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in patients with recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Patients treated with bamlanivimab showed reduced viral load and rates of symptoms and hospitalization. In BLAZE-1, frequency and types of adverse events were similar between bamlanivimab and placebo, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. Infusion reactions and other allergic hypersensitivity events have been reported. The EUA includes a warning for hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions.

“The BLAZE-1 data show bamlanivimab, when given early in the disease course, may help patients clear the virus and reduce COVID-related hospitalizations, supporting our belief that neutralizing antibodies can be an important therapeutic option for patients fighting this virus,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “We’re proud of the speed with which we have been able to bring patients this therapy specifically designed to treat COVID-19. We thank those who have contributed to this medical advancement, particularly the clinical trial investigators and participants around the country.”

The FDA grants emergency use authorization to provide availability of a medicine that may help diagnose, treat or prevent a life-threatening disease when no adequate and approved alternatives are available. This use of bamlanivimab is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use, unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. The authorization is temporary and does not replace the formal review and approval process. Bamlanivimab remains an investigational drug and has not been approved under a Biologics License Application (BLA). Evaluation of its safety and efficacy is ongoing across a range of patient populations impacted by COVID-19. Data from these studies will be used to support a future BLA submission involving bamlanivimab.

Lilly will begin shipping bamlanivimab immediately to AmerisourceBergen, a national distributor, which will distribute it as directed by the U.S. government’s allocation program. For the most up-to-date information regarding access to bamlanivimab, patients should speak with their health care providers, and health care providers should contact their state health department directly.

For more information about the use of bamlanivimab in COVID-19, contact Lilly’s 24-hour support line at 1-855-LillyC19 (1-855-545-5921).

Allocation flow of bamlanivimab in the U.S.
The U.S. government has purchased 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab and committed that Americans will have no out-of-pocket costs for the medicine, although healthcare facilities may charge a fee for the product’s administration.

The federal government is responsible for the appropriate allocation of bamlanivimab. Weekly allocation decisions will be proportionally based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in each state and territory over the previous seven days, based on data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Protect data collection platform. Each week, state and territorial health departments will select sites of care (that are accessible and can minimize infection transmission) to receive allocated doses and will provide AmerisourceBergen the list of sites. Sites of care will then confirm their need and AmerisourceBergen will distribute bamlanivimab overnight.

Global manufacturing and supply of bamlanivimab
To ensure rapid access of this treatment to patients around the world, Lilly has invested in large-scale manufacturing of bamlanivimab at risk – even before data demonstrated its potential to become a meaningful therapeutic option for COVID-19. Lilly has a robust, global supply chain in place to produce bamlanivimab, with numerous manufacturing sites worldwide.

Lilly anticipates manufacturing up to one million doses of bamlanivimab 700 mg by the end of 2020, for use around the world through early next year. Beginning in Q1 2021, the supply of Lilly’s antibody therapy is expected to increase substantially, as additional manufacturing resources come online throughout the year.

Lilly is in discussions with global regulators to make bamlanivimab available around the world. Global allocation will be made based on Lilly’s guiding principles that aim to ensure access for patients with high unmet need, no matter where they live.

Important Information about bamlanivimab 
Bamlanivimab has not been approved by the FDA for any use. It is not known if bamlanivimab is safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19.

Bamlanivimab is authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of bamlanivimab under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

Healthcare providers should review the Fact Sheet for information on the authorized use of bamlanivimab and mandatory requirements of the EUA. Please see the FDA Letter of Authorization, Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, and Fact Sheet for Patients, Parents, and Caregivers (English) (Spanish).

Authorized Use and Important Safety Information
Bamlanivimab is authorized for use under an EUA for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization.

Limitations of Authorized Use

Bamlanivimab is not authorized for use in patients:
who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR
who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR
who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity.
Benefit of treatment with bamlanivimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bamlanivimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation with COVID-19.
Important Safety Information
There are limited clinical data available for bamlanivimab. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with bamlanivimab use.

Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis and Infusion-Related Reactions
There is a potential for serious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis, with administration of bamlanivimab. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

Infusion-related reactions have been observed with administration of bamlanivimab. Signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions may include:

fever, chills, nausea, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, dizziness.
If an infusion-related reaction occurs, consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

Limitations of Benefit and Potential Risk in Patients with Severe COVID-19
Benefit of treatment with bamlanivimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bamlanivimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation with COVID-19. See Limitations of Authorized Use.

Adverse Events
Adverse events reported in at least 1% of BLAZE-1 clinical trial participants on bamlanivimab 700 mg and placebo were Nausea (3% vs 4%), Diarrhea (1% vs 5%), Dizziness (3% vs 2%), Headache (3% vs 2%), Pruritus (2% vs 1%) and Vomiting (1% vs 3%).

Use in Specific Populations
Pregnancy
There are insufficient data on the use of bamlanivimab during pregnancy. Bamlanivimab should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.

Breastfeeding
There are no available data on the presence of bamlanivimab in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

About bamlanivimab
Bamlanivimab is a recombinant, neutralizing human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially treating COVID-19. Bamlanivimab emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628). A Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. A Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987) is also ongoing. In addition, bamlanivimab is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.

About BLAZE-1
BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone or in combination with a second antibody for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than three days prior to drug infusion.

The monotherapy arms of the trial enrolled mild to moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, studying three doses of bamlanivimab (700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg) versus placebo.

The primary outcome measure for the completed arms of the BLAZE-1 trial was change from baseline to day 11 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Additional endpoints include the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through day 29, as well as safety.

The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll over 800 participants.

Data from the monotherapy arms of BLAZE-1 were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

51901,Bayer Reports Regulatory Submission of Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) to the US and EU for CKD and T2D,Bayer submits marketing authorization applications for finerenone in the U.S. and the EU for patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes,"The MAA submitted to the EMA and the NDA to the US is based on P-III FIDELIO-DKD study assessing finerenone (10/20mg, qd) + SOC vs PBO in ~5,700 patients with CKD and T2D
 Result: reduction in the combined risk of time to kidney failure; a decrease of eGFR (≥ 40%) from baseline @4wks. or renal death by 18%, reduction in risk of 2EPs i.e. time to CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for HF by 14% over a median duration of follow-up of 2.6yrs.
 Finerenone is a selective MRA, being evaluated in FIGARO-DKD study in ~7,400 patients with CKD and T2D. Bayer has also initiated P-III FINEARTS-HF study of finerenone in symptomatic HF patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥40%","Berlin, November 9, 2020 – Bayer today announced the submission of regulatory applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of finerenone for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Finerenone is a first-in-class investigational non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that demonstrated renal and cardiovascular benefits in patients with CKD and T2D in the Phase III FIDELIO-DKD study.

“Despite recent advances in treatment, many patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes are still progressing to end-stage kidney failure or premature death,” said Professor George L. Bakris, MD, Department of Medicine, American Heart Association Comprehensive Hypertension Center, University of Chicago Medicine, USA and principal investigator of FIDELIO-DKD. “Finerenone works differently than current therapies and, if approved, provides a potential new treatment option to slow disease progression by directly targeting inflammation and fibrosis, major drivers of CKD progression.”

“With more than 160 million patients living with CKD and T2D, and the prevalence of T2D continuing to rise, CKD is a serious global health challenge that needs to be addressed,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceutical Division and Head of Research and Development. “These submissions are an important step towards our aim to providing finerenone to patients soon. The findings from the FIDELIO-DKD study demonstrated the effects of finerenone in improving outcomes in these patients by delaying CKD progression and reducing the risk for cardiovascular events, and we look forward to working with the regulatory bodies to hopefully make this treatment available to patients as soon as possible.”

The marketing authorization application (MAA) submitted to the EMA and the new drug application (NDA) submitted to the U.S. FDA were based on positive data from the FIDELIO-DKD study, which is part of the largest Phase III clinical trial program to date in CKD and T2D. Results from the trial were presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s (ASN) Kidney Week Reimagined 2020, and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October 2020.

About Finerenone
Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is an investigational novel, non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that has been shown to block many of the harmful effects of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation. MR overactivation is a major driver of kidney and cardiovascular damage through inflammatory and fibrotic processes.

The Phase III program with finerenone in CKD and T2D enrolled 13,000 patients across a broad range of disease severity including those with early kidney damage and more advanced stages of kidney disease. It is the largest Phase III clinical trial program to date in CKD and T2D and comprises two studies, evaluating the effect of finerenone versus placebo on top of standard of care on both renal and cardiovascular outcomes.

FIDELIO-DKD (FInerenone in reducing kiDnEy faiLure and dIsease prOgression in Diabetic Kidney Disease) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, event-driven Phase III study that investigated the efficacy and safety of finerenone in comparison to placebo in addition to standard of care on the reduction of kidney failure and kidney disease progression in approximately 5,700 patients with CKD and T2D from more than 1,000 sites across 48 countries worldwide.
Finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg orally once daily when added to standard of care, including blood glucose lowering therapies and a maximum tolerated dose of a RAS-blocking therapy such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), significantly reduced the combined risk of time to kidney failure, a sustained decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 40% from baseline over a period of at least four weeks, or renal death by 18% (relative risk reduction; HR 0.82 [95% CI, 0.73-0.93; p=0.0014]) over a median duration of follow-up of 2.6 years. Finerenone also significantly reduced the risk of the key secondary endpoint, a composite of time to cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure compared to placebo by 14% (relative risk reduction, HR 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.99; p=0.0339]) over a median duration of follow-up of 2.6 years. Finerenone was well-tolerated, which is consistent with the safety profile seen in previous studies with finerenone.

FIGARO-DKD (FInerenone in reducinG cArdiovascular moRtality and mOrbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease) is still ongoing and is investigating the efficacy and safety of finerenone versus placebo in addition to standard of care on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in approximately 7,400 patients with CKD and T2D across 47 countries including sites in Europe, Japan, China and the U.S.

Bayer also recently announced the initiation of the FINEARTS-HF study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study which will investigate finerenone compared to placebo in more than 5,500 symptomatic heart failure patients (New York Heart Association class II-IV) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥40%. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of finerenone over placebo in reducing the rate of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure (HF) events (defined as hospitalizations for HF or urgent HF visits).

About Chronic Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetes
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a deadly condition that is underrecognized. CKD is one of the most frequent complications arising from diabetes and is also an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. Approximately 40% of all patients with type 2 diabetes develop chronic kidney disease. Despite guideline-directed therapies, patients with CKD and T2D remain at high risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events. It is estimated that CKD affects more than 160 million people with T2D worldwide. Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes is the main cause of end stage kidney disease which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive. MR over-activation is known to trigger detrimental processes (e.g. inflammation and fibrosis) in kidneys and heart in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

51922,AstraZeneca and Amgen Report Results of Tezepelumab in P-III NAVIGATOR for Asthma,Tezepelumab NAVIGATOR Phase III trial met primary endpoint of a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in exacerbations in a broad population of patients with severe asthma,"The P-III NAVIGATOR study involves assessing Tezepelumab + SOC vs PBO + SOC in adults (18–80yrs.) & adolescents (12–17yrs.) with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were receiving treatment with medium/high dose ICS + at least 1 additional controller medication with or without OCS
 Trial met its 1EPs i.e. reduction in AAER @52wks. in the overall population. The study also met 1EPs in patients with low levels of eosinophils i.e. <300 & 150 cells/microlitre
 Tezepelumab is mAb that inhibits the action of TSLP and has received US FDA’s BT designation in Sept’2018 for patients with severe asthma, without an eosinophilic phenotype","AstraZeneca and Amgen today announced positive results from the NAVIGATOR Phase III trial for the potential new medicine tezepelumab in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma.

NAVIGATOR met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to standard of care (SoC) demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful1 reduction in the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks in the overall patient population, compared to placebo when added to SoC. SoC was medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus at least one additional controller medication with or without oral corticosteroids (OCS).

In the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 300 cells per microlitre the trial also met the primary endpoint, with tezepelumab demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in AAER. Similar reductions in AAER were observed in the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 150 cells per microlitre.

Tezepelumab was very well tolerated in patients with severe asthma. Preliminary analyses show no clinically meaningful differences in safety results between the tezepelumab and placebo groups. Results from the NAVIGATOR trial will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

Severe asthma is a debilitating condition affecting approximately 34 million people worldwide.2.3 Many severe asthma patients continue to experience symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite the use of high-dose asthma controller medicines, currently available biologic therapies and OCS.3-5

Professor Andrew Menzies-Gow, Director of the Lung Division, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK, and principal investigator of the NAVIGATOR Phase III trial, said: “Due to the complex nature of severe asthma, many patients continue to face debilitating symptoms despite receiving standard of care inhaled medicines and currently approved biologics. Today’s ground-breaking results show that tezepelumab has the potential to transform care for a broad population of severe asthma patients who are underserved today, including those without an eosinophilic phenotype.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Tezepelumab works differently from any other asthma biologic medicine and targets multiple inflammatory pathways that contribute to asthma symptoms and exacerbations. Building on the broad efficacy previously seen with tezepelumab, these are exciting data that bring us one step closer to delivering a medicine to severe asthma patients, including those with low eosinophil counts.”

Tezepelumab is a potential first-in-class medicine that blocks the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial cytokine that plays a key role across the spectrum of asthma inflammation.6,7 NAVIGATOR is the first Phase III trial to show benefit in severe asthma by targeting TSLP.

The statistically significant and clinically meaningful exacerbation rate reductions demonstrated with tezepelumab in patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 300 cells per microlitre support the US Food and Drug Administration Breakthrough Therapy Designation granted to tezepelumab in September 2018 for patients with severe asthma, without an eosinophilic phenotype. Tezepelumab is being developed by AstraZeneca in collaboration with Amgen (see AstraZeneca and Amgen collaboration below).

Severe asthma

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease affecting an estimated 339 million people worldwide.2,3 Approximately 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma.3,4 Despite the use of inhaled asthma controller medicine, currently available biologic therapies and OCS, many severe asthma patients remain uncontrolled.3-5 Due to the complexity of severe asthma, many patients have unclear or multiple drivers of inflammation and may not qualify for or respond well to a current biologic medicine.4,8,9

Severe, uncontrolled asthma is debilitating with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations, significant limitations on lung function and a reduced quality of life.3,5,10 Patients with severe asthma are at an increased risk of mortality and account for twice as many asthma-related hospitalisations.11-13 There is also a significant socio-economic burden, with these patients accounting for 50% of asthma-related costs.14

NAVIGATOR and the PATHFINDER clinical trial programme

Building on the Phase IIb PATHWAY trial, the Phase III PATHFINDER programme included two trials, NAVIGATOR and SOURCE.15,16 The programme includes additional planned mechanistic and long-term safety trials.

NAVIGATOR is a Phase III, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in adults (18–80 years old) and adolescents (12–17 years old) with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were receiving treatment with medium- or high-dose ICS plus at least one additional controller medication with or without OCS. The trial population included approximately equal proportions of patients with high (≥ 300 cells/µL) and low (< 300 cells/µL) blood eosinophil counts. The trial comprised a five to six week screening period, a 52-week treatment period and a 12-week post-treatment follow-up period. All patients received their prescribed controller medications without change throughout the trial.15,17

The primary efficacy endpoint was the annualised asthma exacerbation rate during the 52-week treatment period. Key secondary endpoints included the effect of tezepelumab on lung function, asthma control and health-related quality of life.15,17

SOURCE is a Phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial for 48 weeks in adult patients with severe asthma who require continuous treatment with ICS plus long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), and chronic treatment with maintenance OCS therapy. The primary endpoint is the categorised percentage reduction from baseline in the daily OCS dose, while not losing asthma control.16,18

Patients who participated in the NAVIGATOR and SOURCE trials were eligible to continue in DESTINATION, a Phase III extension trial assessing long term safety and efficacy.19

Tezepelumab

Tezepelumab is a potential first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of TSLP, a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and is critical in the initiation and persistence of allergic, eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma.6,7 TSLP is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations, including allergens, viruses and other airborne particles.6,7 Expression of TSLP is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity.7,20 Blocking TSLP may prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control.7,20 Tezepelumab acts at the top of the inflammation cascade and has the potential to treat a broad population of severe asthma patients regardless of their type of inflammation.7,20

AstraZeneca and Amgen collaboration

Earlier in 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated the 2012 collaboration agreement for tezepelumab. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid single-digit royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca continues to lead development and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies. Under the amended agreement in North America, Amgen and AstraZeneca will jointly commercialise tezepelumab; Amgen will record sales in the US and AstraZeneca will record sales in Canada. AstraZeneca’s share of gross profits from tezepelumab in the US will be recognised as collaboration revenue. In all countries outside the US and Canada, AstraZeneca will solely commercialise tezepelumab. AstraZeneca will record all sales outside of the US as product sales and recognise Amgen’s share of gross profit as cost of sales.

AstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology

Respiratory & Immunology is one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company.

Glenn, M.D., President of Research and Development, Novavax. “While the regulatory review of this clinical program will be expedited, Novavax remains committed to a data-driven and scientifically rigorous approach in demonstrating safety and efficacy, which we believe will support confidence in the vaccine in the U.S. and globally.”

Novavax expects to begin its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States and Mexico by the end of November. Data from the event-driven trial could support global authorization and approval, including in the U.S. The Company’s ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 is expected to be fully enrolled by the end of November. Depending on the overall COVID-19 attack rate, interim data in the UK trial, which is also event-driven, are expected as soon as early first quarter 2021.

About NVX-CoV2373

NVX-CoV2373 is a vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. NVX-CoV2373 was created using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and contains Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. NVX-CoV2373 contains purified protein antigen and cannot replicate, nor can it cause COVID-19. In preclinical trials, NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated induction of antibodies that block binding of spike protein to receptors targeted by the virus, a critical aspect for effective vaccine protection. In the Phase 1 portion of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial, NVX-CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited robust antibody responses numerically superior to that seen in human convalescent sera. NVX-CoV2373 is also being evaluated in a Phase 3 trial in the UK and two ongoing Phase 2 studies that began in August; a Phase 2b trial in South Africa, and a Phase 1/2 continuation in the U.S. and Australia. Novavax has secured $2 billion in funding for its global coronavirus vaccine program, including up to $399 million in funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and almost $1.7 billion from the U.S. government.

51965,"Henlius Reports First Patients Dosing in P-I Study of HLX14 (denosumab, biosimilar)",First Patient Dosed in Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Henlius Denosumab Biosimilar HLX14,"The first patient has been dosed in a P-I study of HLX14, conducted in 2 parts, Part 1 is a pilot study assessing PK/PD, safety, tolerability & immunogenicity of HLX14 vs EU-sourced denosumab (SC) in healthy male volunteers
 Part 2 is a four-arm study assessing the bioequivalence of HLX14 vs US-, EU-, CN-sourced denosumab. The study also evaluates PD, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity between HLX14 and the reference drug
 Results from the P-I study will provide reference for the dosing scheme in the clinical studies of HLX14","Shanghai, China, November 9th, 2020 – Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial of the company’s denosumab biosimilar HLX14, a recombinant anti-RANKL fully human monoclonal antibody injection. HLX14 was independently developed by Henlius with the denosumab originator as reference drug, and the development is in accordance with the NMPA and EMA biosimilar guidelines. It can be potentially used for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.
HLX14 can increase the bone density of osteoporotic patients
In China, osteoporosis has become a severe health problem for people over 50 years old, especially for middle and aged women. More than one third of women over 50 years old are suffering from osteoporosis[1]. Health problems caused by osteoporosis, like facture, can result in significant loss of quality of life. Nonetheless, the percentage of patients with osteoporosis that have received standardized treatment is relatively low. With the increasing patient number and improved diagnosis of osteoporosis in China, the huge unmet medical needs in the treatment of osteoporosis are urgently to be addressed[2]. HLX14 can specifically bind to RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) and block the interaction between RANKL and RANK, which is expressed on the surface of osteoclasts, thus inhibiting RANKL/RANK-mediated differentiation, maturation and activation of osteoclasts, thereby reducing bone resorption and the incidence of skeletal-related events[3]. Denosumab has been approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture and giant cell tumor of bone by NMPA. Additional indication of denosumab has been approved in the United States and the European Union, which is for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma and in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.
The result of non-clinical studies and NCT04534582 can support the following clinical studies of HLX14
Following the principles of stepwise development, comparability and similarity assessment, HLX14 has been compared with the denosumab originator via a series of head-to-head non-clinical studies. As a result, HLX14 was shown to be highly similar to denosumab in pre-clinical pharmacology, toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies, suggesting potential benefits for osteoporosis patients at high risk of fracture. This is a Phase 1 clinical study of HLX14 in healthy male volunteers conducted in two parts. Part 1 is an open-label, randomised, parallel-controlled, single-dose, two-arm pilot study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of HLX14 and EU-sourced denosumab administered via subcutaneous injection. Part 2 is a double-blind, randomised, parallel-controlled, single-dose, four-arm study primarily aimed to establish the pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of HLX14 and US-, EU-, CN-sourced denosumab (hereinafter referred to as the “reference drug”). The secondary objective of Part 2 is to evaluate the similarity of pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity between HLX14 and the reference drug. Results from this Phase 1 study will provide reference for dosing scheme in the following clinical studies of HLX14.
To address the unmet clinical needs around the globe, Henlius has pro-actively built a diversified and high-quality product pipeline. Up to date, in addition to 汉利康®, the first China-developed biosimilar and 汉曲优®, the first China-developed monoclonal antibody (mAb) biosimilar approved both in China and in the EU, HLX03 (adalimumab) is also potentially to be launched within 2020. What’s more, HLX14 and other self-developed biologics have entered clinical stage, further expanding Henlius’ therapeutic area to benefit more patients. Looking forward, Henlius will continue advancing the development of innovative biologics on the basis of its established and integrated innovation platform, to provide affordable and effective therapies for patients worldwide.

51971,NightWare Receives the US FDA's Approval for the First Medical Device to Stop NightMAres Related to PTSD,FDA Permits Marketing of New Device Designed to Reduce Sleep Disturbance Related to Nightmares in Certain Adults,"The US FDA has permitted marketing of a device intended for the temporary reduction of sleep disturbance related to nightmares in patients aged ≥22 yrs. suffering from nightmare disorder or PTSD
 Nightware utilizes Apple Watch and an iPhone that is configured and logged into a software application and the Nightware server and monitors the wearer’s HR and movement while they sleep and if they are having a nightmare, gently arouse them out of the dream without waking up completely, using the smartwatch’s vibrations
 The platform received the US FDA’s BT designation in May’2019 and now is available by prescription only and is intended for home use","Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration permitted marketing of a new device intended for the temporary reduction of sleep disturbance related to nightmares in adults 22 years or older who suffer from nightmare disorder or have nightmares from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The device provides gentle vibration through touch based on an analysis of heart rate and motion during sleep.

“Sleep is an essential part of a person’s daily routine. However, certain adults who have a nightmare disorder or who experience nightmares from PTSD are not able to get the rest they need. Today’s authorization offers a new, low-risk treatment option that uses digital technology in an effort to provide temporary relief from sleep disturbance related to nightmares,” said Carlos Peña, Ph.D., director of the Office of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

PTSD is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary, or dangerous event. People may experience a range of reactions after trauma, and most will recover from their symptoms over time. Those who continue to experience symptoms, which can include sleep problems and nightmares, may be diagnosed with PTSD. Certain medications may help address specific PTSD symptoms, such as sleep problems and nightmares. An experienced mental health professional can help people find the treatment plan that meets their symptoms and needs.

The device, called Nightware, is a digital therapeutic that uses an Apple Watch and an Apple iPhone that are configured and logged into a software application and the Nightware server. Throughout the night, Apple Watch sensors monitor body movement and heart rate during sleep. These data are sent to the Nightware server and, using a proprietary algorithm, the device creates a unique sleep profile for the patient. When Nightware detects that a patient is experiencing a nightmare based on its analysis of heart rate and body movement, the device provides vibrations through the Apple Watch while the product is in use. Nightware is available by prescription only and is intended for home use.

This device was studied in a 30-day randomized, sham-controlled trial of 70 patients. A sham therapy is an inactive treatment or procedure that is intended to mimic as closely as possible a therapy in a clinical trial. Patients in the sham group wore the device, but no vibratory stimulation was provided. Safety was assessed using validated measurements of suicidality and sleepiness, and there were no changes in either over the course of the study in either group. Sleep was assessed with two versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale, the self-rated questionnaire for assessing sleep quality, including a version of that scale that is intended for patients with PTSD. Both the sham and active groups showed improvement on the sleep scales, with the active group showing greater improvement than sham. The evidence demonstrated the probable benefits outweighed the probable risks.

Nightware is not a standalone therapy for PTSD. The device should be used in conjunction with prescribed medications for PTSD and other recommended therapies for PTSD-associated nightmares and nightmare disorder, according to relevant consensus guidelines. Nightware is intended to be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider. Patients who have been known to “act out” during their nightmares (sleepwalking, violence) should not use Nightware. A healthcare provider should be contacted if daytime sleepiness occurs (If you feel drowsy, do not drive or operate heavy machinery); if the watch vibration causes awakenings not associated with nightmares; or if nightmares persist, worsen, or recur. The watch included in the Nightware kit should be used every night when the user is planning to go to sleep. The watch should not be worn while reading or watching television in bed as this may trigger false alerts. Users should not wear the watch too tightly. If skin irritation occurs, users should discontinue the use of the watch and contact a healthcare provider. The watch included in the Nightware kit may disturb the sleep of the user’s bedpartner if the bedpartner is in contact with the watch when it vibrates. Patients are advised to avoid letting the watch come in contact with their bedpartner at night.

Nightware was granted Breakthrough Device designation for the treatment of nightmares in patients with PTSD. Breakthrough Device designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that may provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.

The FDA reviewed the device through the De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The regulation created is for digital therapy device to reduce sleep disturbance for psychiatric conditions, prescription devices that are intended to provide stimulation using a general purpose computing platform to reduce sleep disturbance in patients who experience this symptom due to psychiatric conditions such as nightmare disorder or PTSD.

The FDA granted the marketing authorization to Nightware, Inc.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

 Radiofrequency ablation uses an electric current to heat up a small area of nerve tissue to stop it from sending pain signals. Studies showed that pain relief following a single radiofrequency ablation treatment can last from 6-12mos.
 The IonicRF generator is the first Abbott-developed radiofrequency ablation device that uses heat to target specific nerves & block pain signals from reaching the brain, currently approved in the US & EU","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Nov. 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced the launch of the IonicRF™ Generator – a new device recently cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to deliver a non-surgical, minimally invasive treatment for the management of pain in the nervous system. The IonicRF Generator is a radiofrequency ablation device that uses heat to target specific nerves and block pain signals from reaching the brain.

The new device is the first Abbott-developed radiofrequency ablation device and is currently approved in the United States and Europe.

“Every patient is different and the source of their pain is unique, making it extremely important to have multiple options available, so treatment can be tailored to individual circumstances,” said Jason E. Pope, M.D., Evolve Restorative Center, Santa Rosa, Calif. “Abbott’s IonicRF is an advanced device platform that targets specific nerves to block pain signals from reaching the brain. One of the most promising aspects of the therapy is its effectiveness in targeting pain in several discrete areas of the body.”

Radiofrequency ablation uses an electric current to heat up a small area of nerve tissue to stop it from sending pain signals.1 Studies have shown that pain relief following a single radiofrequency ablation treatment can last from six to 12 months.2 Low back pain is among the most common medical complaints worldwide—and facet joint syndrome, often treated by radiofrequency ablation therapy, is estimated to account for 15% of these complaints.3 Radiofrequency ablation has been used to treat pain, such as low back pain and Sacroiliac joint (buttocks) pain, that failed to resolve with conservative treatments, such as physical therapy, injections or medication.

“Most people who are candidates for radiofrequency ablation have tried other therapies, such as medications and injections, with limited success. As a result, they are now seeking an alternative solution that does not require surgery or the use of opioid medication,” said Keith Boettiger, vice president, Neuromodulation, Abbott. “We are proud to be able to provide the first Abbott-designed radiofrequency ablation device engineered to deliver safe and effective pain management.* This is another example of our focus on widening the breadth of our neuromodulation portfolio and keeping patients central to everything we do at Abbott.”

(Nasdaq: CVAC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines based on messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”), today announced publication of detailed interim Phase 1 data, following the reporting of positive topline data on November 2, 2020. The manuscript is available on medRxiv and will also be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

The previously announced interim data showed that CVnCoV was generally well tolerated across all tested doses (2-12µg) and induced strong binding and neutralizing antibody responses in addition to first indication of T cell activation. The quality of immune response was found to be comparable to recovered COVID-19 patients, closely mimicking the immune response after natural COVID-19 infection.

CureVac will host a conference call and webcast today at 5 p.m. CET (11 a.m. EST) to provide more insight on the detailed Phase 1 interim trial data. The live webcast link and corresponding presentation slides can be accessed via the Investor Relations section of the CureVac homepage at https://www.curevac.com/en/newsroom/events/

About CVnCoV

CureVac began development of its mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate in January 2020. The compound is an optimized, non-chemically modified mRNA, encoding the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Phase 1 clinical study of CVnCoV began in June 2020 at clinical study centers in Germany and Belgium in collaboration with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI). At the end of September 2020, CVnCoV entered a Phase 2a clinical trial in Peru and Panama, extending clinical studies into older adults and regions with high-incidence of COVID-19 infections. CureVac plans to initiate a pivotal Phase 2b/3 clinical study by the end of 2020. Clinical trial material is provided by the company’s substantial production capacities for mRNA vaccines at its headquarters in Tübingen. The company is currently expanding those manufacturing capacities to allow for broad-scale manufacturing of CVnCoV for potential commercial supply preparedness.

 Results: in the HPV(-) HNSCC group, ORR (50% vs 14.6%) with 2 patients achieving CR & 3 patients achieving PR; mPFS (9.8 vs 2.0 mos.); DCR (90%); median duration of response has not been reached. No responses were observed in the MSS-CRC group of patients
 The company continues to recruit in HPV(-) HNSCC cohort and has decided to expand the size of the current cohort based on the interim data reported","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today shared interim data from the expansion cohort of its ongoing Phase 1 study of the Company’s mRNA personalized cancer vaccine (PCV) mRNA-4157 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda®1 at The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s Annual Meeting (SITC 2020). The dose expansion cohort included 10 patients with HPV(-) Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) and 17 patients with Micro-Satellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC). The data shared today showed that mRNA-4157 given in combination with Keytruda® is well tolerated at all dose levels and produced responses as measured by tumor shrinkage by RECIST 1.1 criteria in HPV(-) HNSCC patients. No responses were observed in the MSS-CRC group of patients.

Tolerability data to date consistently demonstrate that mRNA-4157 is well tolerated. Adverse events are typically low grade and reversible. In the dose expansion cohort, the Overall Response Rate (ORR) in the HPV(-) HNSCC group of patients as measured by RECIST 1.1 is 50% (5/10) with two patients achieving a complete response (CR) with no detectable disease, and three patients achieving partial response (PR), all of which are ongoing. Median progression free survival (mPFS) is 9.8 months, which compares favorably to the published ORR and mPFS of 14.6% and 2.0 months respectively, for Keytruda monotherapy. Including four patients with stable disease, the Disease Control Rate (DCR) is 90% (9/10). Median duration of response has not been reached. The HPV(-) HNSCC cohort continues to recruit and Moderna has decided to expand the size of the current cohort based on the interim data reported today.

Moderna also announced that Dr. Praveen Aanur has joined Moderna as Vice President, Therapeutic Area Head for Oncology Development. Dr. Aanur joins Moderna from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) where he was responsible for multiple regulatory submissions across BMS’ immuno-oncology portfolio. In his seven years at BMS, Dr. Aanur had a wide range of roles increasing responsibility across Clinical Development and Translational Research. Dr. Aanur started his career as a physician and completed his Hematology-Oncology Fellowship at Oregon Health Sciences University, and a Fellowship in Bone Marrow Transplantation at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York where he was also a clinical investigator in the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit. He holds an MBBS from Bangalore University, an MPH from the University of Alabama, and an MBA from Columbia University School of Business.

“We are encouraged by these interim data from our personalized cancer vaccine program, which involves designing and manufacturing a unique vaccine for each patient based on their specific tumor,” said Stephen Hoge, M.D., President of Moderna. “This study demonstrates the ability of Moderna’s mRNA personalized cancer vaccine to elicit clinical activity when given in combination with pembrolizumab. I would also like to welcome Dr. Aanur to Moderna and look forward to working closely with him to continue building our oncology therapeutic area.”

About Moderna’s Immuno-Oncology Programs

Moderna’s oncology programs are currently focused on two main areas: cancer vaccines and intratumoral immuno-oncology (I/O) therapies. Moderna is developing these potential mRNA treatments with strategic collaborators Merck and AstraZeneca. The company currently has five I/O programs in development, including two programs in Phase 2 trials.

An advantage of Moderna’s mRNA platform is that it allows for investigational medicines that combine in a single mRNA therapy several different approaches to activate the immune system to attack cancer, either with mRNA encoding for common tumor proteins found across cancer types or multiple mRNAs encoding for various immunomodulatory proteins.

Moderna’s investigational PCVs are designed to use neoantigens identified from an individual’s tumor to program the body’s immune system to elicit a more effective anti-tumor response. Upon sequencing the tumor, Moderna’s proprietary algorithms predict the neoantigens (antigens encoded by tumor-specific mutated genes) most likely to trigger the immune system to attack a particular cancer. Today, mRNA encoding up to 34 unique neoantigens can be delivered in a single vaccine. Moderna develops and manufactures these investigational PCVs at its personalized vaccines unit within its Massachusetts manufacturing facility.

About Moderna

Moderna is advancing messenger RNA (mRNA) science to create a new class of transformative medicines for patients. mRNA medicines are designed to direct the body’s cells to produce intracellular, membrane or secreted proteins that can have a therapeutic or preventive benefit and have the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases. The company’s platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science, delivery technology and manufacturing, providing Moderna the capability to pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new development candidates.

 Following an initial 12wks. induction treatment phase, fewer patients experienced a flare at any point in the trial @40wks. Abrocitinib is a JAK inhibitor, which modulates multiple cytokines involved in the pathophysiology of AD, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, and TSLP","NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today positive top-line results from the Phase 3 JADE REGIMEN study. This 52-week study investigated abrocitinib, an investigational oral once-daily Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, in patients 12 and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) following response to initial open label induction treatment with abrocitinib 200mg. Patients were randomized into one of three arms: 200mg, 100mg, or placebo. Both doses of abrocitinib met the primary endpoint, resulting in significantly fewer patients experiencing a loss of response requiring rescue treatment, or “flaring,” compared to those randomized to placebo. Both doses also met the key secondary endpoint of a larger percentage of patients maintaining an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) response of clear or almost clear relative to placebo.

“Atopic dermatitis brings a lot of uncertainty and disruption to daily life, and the unpredictability of flares can make treating and managing the disease complex and frustrating,” said Michael Corbo, PhD, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “These latest results from our Phase 3 clinical trial program shed light on the potential abrocitinib, if approved, could have to prevent troublesome flares in patients.”

JADE REGIMEN Top-Line Results

The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints. After achieving clinical response in the induction period, patients who continued on the higher dose of abrocitinib, 200mg, or switched to the lower dose, 100mg, had a significantly higher probability of not experiencing a flare compared to those on placebo through week 52 (81.1%, 57.4%, and 19.1%, respectively; p<0.0001 for both doses versus placebo). In addition, patients who continued on the higher dose of abrocitinib were significantly less likely to flare than those on the lower dose (p<0.0001). Patients on either dose of abrocitinib were significantly more likely to maintain an IGA score of clear (zero) or almost clear (one) compared to placebo (p<0.0001 for both doses versus placebo).

The primary endpoint after treatment in the 12-week induction phase was the loss of response requiring rescue treatment among groups during the blinded treatment period up to 40 weeks. Loss of response requiring rescue treatment, or a “flare,” was defined as a loss of at least 50% of the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) response at week 12 and an IGA score of two or higher (on a five-point scale). The key secondary endpoint was the loss of response based on an IGA score of two or higher.

Out of 1,233 subjects enrolled, 798 (64.7%) responded during the initial 12-week induction period with abrocitinib monotherapy (200mg, once daily), a higher than expected responder rate compared to the monotherapy studies JADE MONO-1 and JADE MONO-2. Responder criteria was defined as achieving an IGA score of clear (zero) or almost clear (one), a reduction from IGA baseline of at least two points, and reaching an EASI-75 response compared to baseline.

No new safety signals were observed in the trial. Safety results showed that during the induction period 66.5% of patients experienced an adverse event and 1.6% experienced a serious adverse event. Following randomization, a higher percentage of patients receiving either the 200mg or 100mg dose of abrocitinib experienced adverse events compared to placebo (63.2%, 54%, and 45.3%, respectively). The percentage of patients who experienced serious adverse events were 4.9%, 1.5%, and 0.7%, respectively. More patients treated with abrocitinib discontinued from the study due to adverse events (6%, 1.9%, and 1.5%, respectively). One patient died from gastric adenocarcinoma 208 days following discontinuation from the induction treatment period, which was deemed unrelated to the study drug by the investigator.

Additional Details About the JADE REGIMEN Study

JADE REGIMEN was a 52-week, randomized, responder-enriched, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 withdrawal trial enrolling 1,233 subjects globally. The trial included a 12-week open-label run-in period to determine responder status to an initial induction treatment with abrocitinib monotherapy (200mg, once daily). Patients in the open-label run-in period did not receive any topical therapy. Subjects with a positive clinical response to abrocitinib induction treatment at the end of the 12-week open-label run-in period entered a 40-week, double-blind, maintenance treatment period in which they were randomized into one of three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio: placebo, abrocitinib 100mg once daily, or abrocitinib 200mg once daily. Medicated topical and/or systemic standard of care therapies were not allowed during the open-label run-in and blinded treatment periods.

During the blinded treatment period, subjects meeting the protocol definition of flare entered an open-label rescue period during which they receive another 12-week course of abrocitinib 200mg once daily with topical therapy per local standard of care (SOC). In this study, flare requiring rescue treatment was defined as a loss of at least 50% of the EASI response at week 12 and an IGA score of two or higher.

Eligible subjects completing the 40 weeks of blinded treatment, or a full 12-week rescue treatment period, had the option to enter a long-term extension (LTE) study, B7451015. Subjects discontinuing early from treatment, or who were otherwise ineligible for the LTE study, entered a four-week follow up period in this study.

JADE REGIMEN is the fifth trial in the JAK1 Atopic Dermatitis Efficacy and Safety (JADE) global development program. Pfizer announced complete results from the second trial in the program, JADE MONO-2, as well as top-line results from the JADE TEEN and JADE COMPARE studies, earlier this year. Additionally, complete results from JADE MONO-1 were published in The Lancetin July 2020. Additional data from other studies in the JADE program will be available in the coming months.

Full results from JADE REGIMEN will be submitted for presentation at a future scientific meeting and publication in a medical journal.

About Abrocitinib

Abrocitinib is an oral small molecule that selectively inhibits Janus kinase (JAK) 1. Inhibition of JAK1 is thought to modulate multiple cytokines involved in pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).

In October 2020, Pfizer announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Priority Review designation to the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for abrocitinib 100mg and 200mg for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in patients 12 and older, with a decision expected in April 2021. Priority Review designation is granted to medicines that the FDA considers to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious condition. Abrocitinib received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD in February 2018.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for abrocitinib in the same patient population with a decision anticipated in the second half of 2021.

Abrocitinib also received a Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation from the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) earlier this year, which indicates that a product may be eligible for the early access to medicines scheme (EAMS) based on early clinical data. EAMS aims to give patients with life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to medicines that do not yet have a marketing authorization when there is a clear unmet medical need.

About Atopic Dermatitis

AD is a chronic skin disease characterized by inflammation of the skin and skin barrier defects.1,2 Lesions of AD are characterized by erythema (skin turning red or purple depending on normal skin color), itching, induration (hardening)/papulation (formulation of papules), and oozing/crusting.2,3

AD is one of the most common, chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, affecting up to 10% of adults and up to 20% of children worldwide.3,4

About Pfizer’s Immunokinase Inhibitor Leadership

The JAK pathways are believed to play an important role in inflammatory processes as they are involved in signaling for over 50 cytokines and growth factors, many of which drive immune-mediated conditions.5 JAK inhibition may offer patients with these conditions a potential new advanced treatment option.6

Pfizer’s leading JAK biology and chemistry expertise, combined with our research experience, has uniquely enabled the company to take a different R&D approach to that of other companies involved in JAK research, resulting in one of the broadest immunokinase inhibitor pipelines. Instead of studying a single molecule for all its potential uses, where it may not be optimal for some, Pfizer’s candidates with unique selectivity profiles are purposefully matched to the conditions where we believe they have the greatest potential to, if approved, address unmet need. Pfizer has five unique immunokinase inhibitors in late-stage clinical trials for the potential treatment of ten immune-mediated diseases:

Abrocitinib: A JAK1 inhibitor currently under regulatory review by the FDA and EMA for the potential treatment of moderate-to-severe AD among adolescents and adults
Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600): An oral, JAK3/TEC family kinase inhibitor in a phase 3 clinical trial for the potential treatment of alopecia areata (AA) and in phase 2 for vitiligo, Crohn’s disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC)
Brepocitinib (PF-06700841): A tyrosine kinase 2(TYK2)/JAK1 inhibitor in phase 2 clinical trials for the potential treatment of psoriasis and AD in topical formulation, and, in oral formulation for psoriatic arthritis, CD, UC, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), AA and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)
PF-06826647: A TYK2 inhibitor under investigation in phase 2 clinical trials for the potential treatment of psoriasis and HS
PF-06650833: An IL-1 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) inhibitor under investigation for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and HS in phase 2 clinical trials

Vaccine doses for Europe will be produced in BioNTech’s German manufacturing sites, as well as in Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Belgium. If the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate receives approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), then doses will be ordered by the EU Member States who have elected to receive the vaccine as part of this agreement.

“Since the onset of the pandemic, Pfizer’s priority has been to develop a safe and effective vaccine, while simultaneously scaling up our manufacturing to deliver doses before the end of the year. This is an ambitious goal but critical to halting this global pandemic,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and CEO, Pfizer. “Today’s finalized supply agreement with the European Commission represents the largest initial order of vaccine doses for Pfizer and BioNTech to date and a major step toward our shared goal of making a COVID-19 vaccine available to vulnerable populations.”

“As a company founded in the heart of Europe, we are looking forward to supplying millions of people upon regulatory approval. We would like to thank the Commission and the Member States for their support and trust in our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Our aim is to develop a safe and effective vaccine to contribute to bringing this pandemic to an end. Only through joint efforts will we be able to do so,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

Pfizer and BioNTech announced the conclusion of exploratory talks with the European Commission to supply doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate, if approved, on September 9, 2020. The proposed supply agreement is now final.

On November 9, 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced their mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, against SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated evidence of efficacy against COVID-19 in participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on the first interim efficacy analysis conducted on November 8, 2020 by an external, independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) from the Phase 3 clinical study. The DMC reviewed 94 cases. The case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates a vaccine efficacy rate above 90%, at 7 days after the second dose. This means that protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the vaccination, which consists of a 2-dose schedule. As the study continues, the final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. The DMC has not reported any serious safety concerns and recommends that the study continue to collect additional safety and efficacy data as planned. The data will be discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-review publication.

In addition to engagements with governments, Pfizer and BioNTech have provided an expression of interest for possible supply to the COVAX Facility, a mechanism established by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and World Health Organization (WHO) that, using a range of technology platforms, aims to provide governments, including those in the emerging markets, with early access to a large portfolio of COVID-19 candidate vaccines produced by multiple manufacturers across the world.

About the BNT162 Vaccine Candidate Program

The BNT162 program is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and supported by Pfizer’s global vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities. Two of the companies’ four investigational vaccine candidates – BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 – received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), based on preliminary data from Phase 1/2 studies that are currently ongoing in the U.S. and Germany as well as animal immunogenicity studies. During preclinical and clinical studies, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 emerged as strong candidates based on assessments of safety and immune response.

On July 27, 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that following extensive review of preclinical and clinical data from Phase 1/2 clinical trials, and in consultation with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and other global regulators, the companies selected the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate to move forward into a Phase 2/3 study. BNT162b2 encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein (S), which is the target of virus neutralizing antibodies.

About the Study

The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27, 2020 and has enrolled 43,538 participants to date, 38,955 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 8, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The trial is continuing to enroll and is expected to continue through the final analysis when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the primary efficacy endpoints evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accruing from 7 days after the second dose, the final analysis now will also include, with the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), new secondary endpoints evaluating efficacy based on cases accruing 14 days after the second dose. The companies believe that the addition of these secondary endpoints will help align data across all COVID-19 vaccine studies and allow for cross-trial learnings and comparisons between these novel vaccine platforms. The companies have posted an updated version of the study protocol at https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus.

Pfizer and BioNTech are continuing to accumulate safety data and currently estimate that a median of two months of safety data following the second (and final) dose of the vaccine candidate – the amount of safety data specified by the FDA in its guidance for potential Emergency Use Authorization – will be available by the third week of November. Additionally, participants will continue to be monitored for long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose. Along with the efficacy data generated from the clinical trial, Pfizer and BioNTech are working to prepare the necessary safety and manufacturing data to submit to the FDA to demonstrate the safety and quality of the vaccine product produced.

Assuming positive data and availability of the necessary safety and manufacturing data, and based on current projections, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. To meet those anticipated quantities and milestones, the companies have produced sufficient supply for their Phase 2/3 clinical trial and have begun to produce and stockpile their pandemic supply.

The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate is not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world. Both collaborators are committed to developing these novel vaccines with preclinical and clinical data at the forefront of all their decision making.

 The targeted immunodominant were identified through the T-Scan TCR/Target discovery platform enabling the mapping of the specific epitopes in SARS-CoV-2","November 10, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time
WALTHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–TScan Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cell therapies in oncology, today announced the signing of a research license and option agreement with QIAGEN to develop T cell-based laboratory tests for detecting prior exposure to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, using discoveries from TScan’s high-throughput TCR/Target discovery platform, T-Scan. Under the terms of the agreement, QIAGEN secures an option to license the rights and intellectual property for several of TScan’s discovered immunodominant T cell targets, associated sequences and relevant data for the development and commercialization of in vitro diagnostic tests. In advance of exercising its option, QIAGEN will have the right to further evaluate TScan’s discoveries.

“We are excited to partner with QIAGEN in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic by combining our unique insight into how T cells recognize the novel coronavirus with QIAGEN’s deep expertise in diagnostics,” said Gavin MacBeath, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at TScan. “Current tests for prior exposure to coronavirus rely on the detection of antibodies, which tend to diminish within a couple of months of being infected with the virus. We believe that detecting anti-viral T cells based on our discoveries will provide a more reliable way to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2 over a much longer period following infection. If the presence of anti-viral T cells can be linked to protection from future infection, a test like this may ultimately provide valuable information on the course of the pandemic and how to return safely to normal life.”

“As a world-wide leader in the development and commercialization of diagnostic products, QIAGEN is an ideal partner to develop T cell-based tests for COVID-19,” said David Southwell, Chief Executive Officer at TScan. “This marks our second collaboration in our efforts to provide tools in the fight against COVID-19 and highlights the urgency for continued innovation for next-generation vaccines, T cell therapeutics and T cell-based diagnostics to address the dire need posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This collaboration also reinforces the depth of our T-Scan discovery platform, including its broad application in target discovery across oncology, autoimmune disease and infectious disease that can be leveraged in-house or advanced with key partners.”

The immunodominant targets included in the agreement were identified through the T-Scan TCR/Target discovery platform, which enabled rapid and comprehensive mapping of the specific epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 that are recognized by the CD8+ T cells of patients recovering from COVID-19. Importantly, the study also revealed that patients’ T cells do not cross-react with seasonal coronaviruses that cause the common cold, decreasing the likelihood that a T cell-based diagnostic test would result in false-positive results. TScan recently published these findings in the scientific journal Immunity in an article titled “Unbiased Screens Show CD8+ T cells of COVID-19 Patients Recognize Shared Epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 that Largely Reside outside the Spike Protein.” The study was conducted in collaboration with academic partners Atlantic Health System in Morristown, NJ and Ochsner Medical Center, who supported sample collection from convalescent COVID-19 patients.

Financial terms of the collaboration were not disclosed.

52052,AstraZenca's Calquence (acalabrutinib) Fails to Meet its Primary Endpoint in P-II Studies for COVID-19,Update on CALAVI Phase II trials for Calquence in patients hospitalised with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19,"The P-ll CALAVI programme involves assessing Calquence + BSC vs BSC as monothx. in patients in a ratio (1:1) hospitalized with respiratory complications of COVID-19 in the ratio of 1:1. The trials conducted in the US and in multiple other countries across the world
 The CALAVI program did not meet its 1EPs of increasing the proportion of patients who remained alive and free of respiratory failure, safety and tolerability profiles were consistent with previous studies
 Calquence is selective inhibitor of BTK, binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity","The CALAVI Phase II trials for Calquence (acalabrutinib) in patients hospitalised with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint. The addition of Calquence to best supportive care (BSC) did not increase the proportion of patients who remained alive and free of respiratory failure. No new safety signal for Calquence was observed in the trials.

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Since the beginning of the year, AstraZeneca has been committed to doing everything we can to respond to COVID-19, including investigating existing medicines as potential treatments. The CALAVI trials were launched based on preclinical and early clinical evidence that Calquence could decrease the hyperinflammatory immune response and improve clinical outcomes in patients hospitalised with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.1 While the CALAVI results are disappointing, we remain committed to advancing science that helps patients during this unprecedented global pandemic, including clinical trials for the AstraZeneca Oxford coronavirus vaccine and our long-acting antibody combination.”

The CALAVI programme comprised two Phase II trials investigating acalabrutinib plus BSC versus BSC alone in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 disease.

The safety and tolerability profiles for Calquence in the CALAVI Phase II trials were consistent with previous trials. The data will be presented in due course.

Results from the CALAVI Phase II trials do not impact approved indications or pending approvals for Calquence in patients with blood cancers.

CALAVI

The CALAVI Phase II programme comprised two randomised, open-label, multicentre trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Calquence with BSC versus BSC alone in patients hospitalised with respiratory complications of COVID-19. The trials were randomised (1:1) and evaluated the addition of Calquence to current BSC in patients who were hospitalised but not on mechanical ventilation and not in the intensive care unit. The primary endpoint measured respiratory failure or death. The trials were conducted in the US (CALAVI US) and in multiple other countries across the world (CALAVI).2,3

Calquence

Calquence (acalabrutinib) is a next-generation, selective inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Calquence binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.4,5 In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.4

As part of an extensive clinical development programme, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating Calquence in more than 20 company-sponsored clinical trials. Calquence is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, follicular lymphoma, and other haematologic malignancies.

 Results: reduction in HbA1C (0.33%); patients who did mod. to high-intensity activity duration of at least 150mins/ week, reduction in HbA1C (0.66%); reduction in fasting BG (10.92 mg/dL), reduction in LDL-C (11.55 mg/dL); reduction of weight up to 2kg; increased frequency in mod. to high-intensity activity to 7.03 times a week among some patients
 The Health2Sync’s platform allows HCPs to seamlessly monitor patients’ information and provide remote consultative advice where necessary","HONG KONG, Nov. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ –Â Health2Sync, the number one diabetes management app in Taiwan and Japan, today announced the results of their clinical study in Taiwan, demonstrating that combining Fitbit wearable devices with their Health2Sync Patient Management Platform can help users control and better manage the symptoms of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the study[1], conducted with four of Taiwan’s leading diabetes clinics, participants recorded significant average improvements in key indicators, such as reduced HbA1C, fasting blood glucoseÂ and LDL-C, and higher blood glucose measurement frequency — a valuable proof of concept for usingÂ Fitbit wearables withÂ diabetes careÂ protocols and solutions.

The study found:

Average glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) decreased 0.33%, while patients who did moderate to high-intensity activity duration of at least 150 mins per week, saw their average HbA1C[2] decrease 0.66%
Average fasting blood glucose (BG) decreased 10.92 mg/dL
Average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased 11.55 mg/dL
Weight reduction of up to 2 kilograms among some patients
Increased frequency in moderate to high intensity activity to 7.03 times a week among some patients
Conducted over a three-month period ending in July 2020 in conjunction with the Neng-Chun Diabetes Clinic, Da-Ya Chang-An Clinic, Yier Clinic and Banqiao Da-Jun Clinic, the study, with patient consent, letsÂ the patients’ doctors track the progress and lifestyle changes of 95 participants with T2DM. Prior to the commencement of the study, doctors at the four clinics established benchmarks for all participating patients based on blood glucose tests at the start of the trial, then on a self-monitored weekly basis throughout the study period.

Each participant was given aÂ Fitbit Inspire HRÂ and the participants voluntarily agreed to connect their Fitbit wearable data with the Health2Sync diabetes management app to track their progress throughout the program. Physical activity data generated fromÂ each person’sÂ Fitbit device was integrated into the Health2Sync app,Â which housed other health metrics such as patients’ HbA1c, BG and cholesterol levels. This letÂ doctors seamlessly monitor patients’ information on the Health2Sync Patient Management Platform and provide remote consultative advice where necessary.

DR. KUO-LIANG LU OF DA-YA CHANG-AN CLINIC IN TAIWAN, said: “The results speak for themselves. We saw a reduction in some of our patients’ weight by an average of two kilograms and fasting BG levels of study participants from Da-Ya Chang-An clinic decreased 11.10 mg/dL within 3 months[3], leading to significant health improvements.”

DR. NENG-CHU YU OF NENG-CHUN DIABETES CLINIC said: “Type 2 diabetes, with the right lifestyle changes Â– medication adherence, increased activity, and better diet Â– can lead to major improvements in control of blood glucose levels. The integration of Fitbit data with Health2SyncÂ let meÂ easily view my patients’ activities and self-monitored data, enabling me to make necessary suggestions and give guidance to help patients for further improvement.”

Diabetes is a chronic condition that, if not managed, can lead to health complications like blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.[4] It remains the second highest cause in premature mortality, after cancer, among major non-communicable diseases in Taiwan[5] and its prevalenceÂ has posed economic burdens such as increased personal and healthcare spending and loss of work productivity.[6]

A holistic approach to managing T2DM requires lifestyle changes, which includes medication adherence, exercise and proper diet. The integration with Fitbit wearable devices and activity data is key to helping to promote healthier behaviours and improve participants’ health outcomes. Participants received reminders for weekly exercises via their Health2Sync App, which promoted an increased frequency in moderate to high intensity activity at 7.03 times a week. The increased levels of activity corresponded with an improvement in patients’ health conditions.

“We are thrilled to see such optimistic results in the clinical study. We believe that innovations in Fitbit wearable devices and Fitbit health solutions have a major role to play in the global effort against diabetes Â– whether it is in reducing the onset of diabetes, or helping patients to better manage their condition Â– and we look forward to further expanding on our partnership with Fitbit,” said ED DENG, CEO AT HEALTH2SYNC.

“The behavioural changes exhibited by study participants reinforces our belief that Fitbit amplifies our intrinsic motivation to adopt healthier habits, which can make all the difference when dealing with a condition like Type 2 diabetes where lifestyle factors play such a big role,” said STEVE MORLEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS & GENERAL MANAGER OFÂ ASIA PACIFICÂ ATÂ FITBIT. “Together with the seamless experience that Health2Sync provides for patients and their health providers to track key indicators, they create a powerful solution that makes it simpler and more convenient to manage conditions like Type 2 diabetes.”

In September last year, Fitbit and Health2Sync collaborated to allow the integration of Fitbit’s health, sleep and fitness wearable data with the Health2Sync app (with user consent) to support Health2Sync’s 520,000 users in Japan and Taiwan to better manage their conditions, like Type 2 diabetes. The new platform gives users who have a Fitbit account access to an in-app dashboard that includes the option to agree to share their wearable data from their Fitbit devices[7], including heart rate, sleep and physical activity, alongside recent blood glucose readings from Health2Sync depicting if levels fall within, above, or below the healthy range.

[1]Â The study was conducted on 95 participants, ages 18- 60.

[2] The term HbA1c refers to glycated haemoglobin. Diabetics with higher levels of HbA1c face greater risk of developing diabetes-related complications.

QIAGEN has begun marketing and distributing QIAreach™ SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test in the United States after applying for FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) for symptomatic patients. CE-IVD registration for European Union and other markets is expected as early as by the end of the year.

“As existing approaches often lack scalability and accuracy, antigen testing is playing an increasingly important role in national testing strategies as a complementary tool to PCR, the gold-standard for detecting active COVID-19 infections,” said Thierry Bernard, Chief Executive Officer of QIAGEN. “QIAreach SARS-CoV Antigen is a fast, digital and easy to use test that makes use of sensitive nanoparticle technology from Ellume. In as little as two minutes it allows objective reading of test results that provide clear qualitative interpretation. And it addresses the growing need for higher throughput testing for SARS-CoV-2 antigen by processing up to eight tests per hub simultaneously.”

Testing of clinical samples have shown the QIAreach™ SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test to have a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100%. It is the second QIAGEN COVID-19 test to make use of the digital eHub and eStick system made by its partner Ellume. QIAGEN in August announced the QIAreach™ Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test – and both tests can run on the digital platform interchangeably.

The portable system provides a true walkaway solution with random access and does not require maintenance or calibration. It contains a rechargeable battery for eight hours of remote use and can fully connect to laboratory information management systems (LIMS) with an optional use software. The eHub will also run the QIAreach QuantiFERON®-TB test, a novel test for the detection of latent tuberculosis infections in low resource and high burden settings that is currently in development.

QIAreach™ SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test uses the rugged and portable eHub to analyze eight eSticks with nasopharangeal-swab samples from symptomatic people at once, each test running independently of the others. The easy-to-use eStick uses nanoparticle fluorescent detection technology to flag the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, an antigen present on the inside of the virus. The device can detect strong positive cases in as little as two minutes and negative cases in 15 minutes.

52152,Microsoft Collaborates with Twist and Illumina to Advance Data Storage in DNA,"Twist Bioscience, Illumina and Western Digital Form Alliance with Microsoft to Advance Data Storage in DNA","Microsoft enters collaboration with Illumina, Twist, and Western Digital to establish a roadmap for the industry towards the wider use of DNA data storage. These companies are the founding members of the alliance
 Ten additional technology leaders join founding members to together advance industry roadmap, set the stage for widespread adoption of new long-term storage option
 The alliance announced at the virtual Flash Memory Summit, focus to set technology & formatting standards with the goal of building interoperable commercial systems capable of housing the exponential amounts of data expected to be generated in the future","SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Twist Bioscience Corporation (NASDAQ: TWST), Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ: ILMN) and Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) today announced the formation of an alliance with Microsoft to advance the field of DNA data storage. These founding companies, alongside member organizations, will work together to create a comprehensive industry roadmap that will help the industry achieve interoperability between solutions and help establish the foundations for a cost-effective commercial archival storage ecosystem for the explosive growth of digital data.

“DNA is an incredible molecule that, by its very nature, provides ultra-high-density storage for thousands of years,” said Emily M. Leproust, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Twist Bioscience. “By joining with other technology leaders to develop a common framework for commercial implementation, we drive a shared vision to build this new market solution for digital storage.”

DNA data storage has the potential to deliver a true low-cost archival data storage solution. While current storage technologies have limited longevity and require data migration for long-term data storage, DNA provides a stable format storage medium that is durable for thousands of years when properly stored. In addition, DNA enables cost effective and rapid duplication. Importantly, it is incredibly dense, with 10 full length digital movies fitting into a volume the size of a single grain of salt. Digital data stored in DNA can be stored in a variety of containers including capsules, pellets or encased in glass beads.

“At Microsoft Research, we proactively address the future challenges of technology, with sustainability in mind,” commented Karin Strauss, Ph.D., senior principal research manager at Microsoft. “In collaboration with University of Washington, we have demonstrated a fully automated end-to-end system capable of storing and retrieving data from DNA, and we have separately stored 1GB of data in DNA synthesized by Twist and recovered data from it. We’re encouraged by the potential for more sustainable data storage with DNA and look forward to collaborating with others in the industry to explore early commercialization of this technology.”

By 2024, 30% of digital businesses will mandate DNA storage trials, addressing the exponential growth of data poised to overwhelm existing storage technology.1

“There is an unmet need for a new long-term archival storage medium that keeps up with the rate of digital data growth,” said Steffen Hellmold, vice president corporate strategic initiatives, Western Digital. “We estimate that almost half of the data storage solutions shipped in 2030 will be used to archive data as the overall temperature of data is cooling down. We are committed to providing a full portfolio of storage solutions addressing the demand for hot, warm and cold storage.”

“A key component of a DNA data storage system is its ability to read back the digital information when needed,” stated Alex Aravanis, M.D., Ph.D., chief technology officer at Illumina. “We believe Illumina’s innovative sequencing technology will be critical in enabling this market at commercial scale and look forward to collaborating with other leaders in their respective fields to make this a viable, long-term solution for archival storage.”

Twist Bioscience, Illumina, Western Digital and Microsoft are joining the Alliance as founding members. In addition to developing an industry roadmap, the DNA Data Storage Alliance plans to develop use cases in various markets and industries as well as promote and educate the larger storage community to promote adoption of this future solution. The following organizations have joined the alliance as members:

How to Store Digital Data in DNA

To store data in DNA, first, a data file is converted from its digital sequence of 0’s and 1’s into a DNA sequence of A’s, C’s, T’s and G’s. The DNA data file is then synthesized (“written”) in short segments of DNA (200 to 300 bases long) and stored. In addition to storing part of the data file, each short segment contains an index to indicate its place within the overall data file. To retrieve the data, the segments are sequenced (“read”) and then decoded back into the original file. One feature of the indexing system is it allows part of the file to be biologically recovered (“random access”) before sequencing, so only data of interest is sequenced. In addition, all data is recovered error-free because error-correcting algorithms are used during the encode/decode process.

52164,Eisai's Fycompa (perampanel) Receives EC's Approval for Expanded Indication in Pediatric Patients with POS and PGTCS,EISAI RECEIVES APPROVAL FOR INDICATION EXPANSION OF ANTI-EPILEPTIC AGENT FYCOMPA® FOR USE IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS,"The approval extends the use of Fycompa as adjunctive therapy for POS (with/out secondary generalization) by expanding the approved age range from 12yrs.+ to 4yrs.+ and for PGTCS from 12yrs.+ to 7yrs.+
 The approval is based on P-III 311 study assessing Fycompa (oral suspension) as adjunctive therapy in 180 pediatric patients (aged 4-12 yrs.) with POS or PGTCS
 The 232 study involves assessing the PK, efficacy, and long-term safety of Fycompa taken at the same time as other AEDs therapy in 63 pediatric patients with epilepsy in patients aged 2 to >12yrs. Fycompa is an AMPA receptor antagonist that reduces neuronal hyperexcitation associated with seizures","Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) announced that it has been received approval from the European Commission for the use of its in-house discovered and developed anti-epileptic agent (AED) Fycompa® (generic name: perampanel) in the treatment of pediatric patients. This approval extends the use of Fycompa as an adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures (POS) (with or without secondary generalization) by expanding the approved age range from 12 years and above to 4 years and above, and for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) from 12 years and above to 7 years and above.

The approval was based on the results of Phase III (Study 311) and Phase II (Study 232) clinical studies conducted globally to evaluate Fycompa as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients with POS or PGTCS. Study 311 evaluated the safety, tolerability, and exposure-efficacy relationship of Fycompa when administered as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients aged 4 to less than 12 years with inadequately controlled POS or PGTCS. This study showed that the safety and efficacy of the Fycompa combination therapy in pediatric epilepsy patients with poorly controlled partial seizures (ages 4 to less than 12 years) were similar to those in patients aged 12 years and older. The most common adverse events (incidence of 10% or higher) observed in this study were somnolence, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, vomiting, dizziness, influenza, and irritability. Study 232 evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and long-term safety of Fycompa as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients with epilepsy (from 2 to less than 12 years of age). The adverse events (≥10% in the Fycompa arms) observed in Study 232 were pyrexia, fatigue, vomiting, irritability, somnolence, dizziness, and upper respiratory tract infection.

Fycompa is a first-in-class AED discovered at Eisai’s Tsukuba Research Laboratories. The agent is a highly selective, noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist that is postulated to reduce neuronal hyper-excitation associated with seizures by targeting glutamate activity at AMPA receptors on postsynaptic membranes. In Japan and the United States, Fycompa is currently approved for monotherapy and adjunctive use in the treatment of POS (with or without secondarily generalized seizures) in patients with epilepsy 4 years of age and older, as well as adjunctive treatment for PGTCS in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.

Eisai considers neurology, including epilepsy, a therapeutic area of focus. As we offer several treatment options in Europe, including Fycompa, Eisai pursues its mission to provide “seizure freedom” to a greater number of patients with epilepsy. Eisai seeks to address the diverse needs of, as well as increasing the benefits provided to, patients with epilepsy and their families.

1. About Fycompa (generic name: perampanel)

Fycompa is a first-in-class anti-epileptic agent (AED) discovered and developed by Eisai. With epileptic seizures being mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, the agent is a highly selective, noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist that reduces neuronal hyperexcitation associated with seizures by targeting glutamate activity at AMPA receptors on postsynaptic membranes. Fycompa is available in drug form to be taken once daily orally at bedtime. A tablet and fine granule formulation have been approved in Japan. An oral suspension formulation and tablet have been approved in the United States and Europe.

Fycompa is currently approved in more than 70 countries and territories, including Japan, the United States, China, and other countries in Europe and in Asia as an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures (with or without secondarily generalized seizures) in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older. In Europe the approved age range will be expanded to 4 years and above based on this approval. In addition, Fycompa has been approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, Japan, in Europe and in Asia for treatment as an adjunctive therapy for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older. In Europe the approved age range will be expanded to 7 years and above based on this approval.

In Japan and the United States, Fycompa is approved for monotherapy and adjunctive use in the treatment of partial-onset seizures (with or without secondarily generalized seizures) in patients with epilepsy 4 years of age and older. To date, Fycompa has been used to treat more than 300,000 patients worldwide across all indications.

Eisai is conducting a global Phase III clinical study (Study 338) for the agent in patients with seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In addition, Eisai is conducting development of an injection formulation.

2. About Study 311 1

Study 311 is a global (United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea), open-label Phase III clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and exposure efficacy relationship of the Fycompa oral suspension when administered as an adjunctive therapy in 180 pediatric epilepsy patients aged 4 to less than 12 with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This study comprised a treatment phase, including a titration period of up to 11 weeks and a maintenance period of up to 12 weeks and an extension phase. In this study, 2 to 16 mg of Fycompa was taken orally once daily before bedtime. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. Efficacy was similar to that observed in patients 12 years of age and older. The most common adverse events (incidence of 10% or higher) observed in this study were somnolence, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, vomiting, dizziness, influenza, and irritability, which is consistent with the safety profile of Fycompa to date.

3. About Study 232 2

Study 232 was a global (United States, Europe), multicenter, open-label clinical study with an extension phase to evaluate 63 pediatric patients with epilepsy (ages 2 to less than 12). The study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of Fycompa oral suspension taken at the same time as other AEDs. Administration of once-daily Fycompa was titrated from 0.015 mg/kg to 0.18 mg/kg, and long-term safety was confirmed after 11 weeks of treatment and an extension phase (41 weeks). The adverse events (≥10% in the Fycompa arms) observed in Study 232 were pyrexia, fatigue, vomiting, irritability, somnolence, dizziness, upper respiratory tract infection.

4. About Epilepsy

Epilepsy is broadly categorized by seizure type, with partial-onset seizures accounting for approximately 60% of epilepsy cases and generalized seizures accounting for approximately 40%. In a partial-onset seizure, an abnormal electrical disturbance occurs in a limited area of the brain, and may subsequently spread throughout the brain, becoming a generalized seizure (known as a secondarily generalized seizure). In a generalized seizure, abnormal electrical disturbances occur throughout the brain, and can be followed by a loss of consciousness or physical symptoms manifested throughout the whole body.

Epilepsy affects approximately 1 million people in Japan, 3.4 million people in the United States, 6 million people in Europe, 9 million people in China, and approximately 60 million people worldwide. As approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy are unable to control their seizures with currently available AEDs,3 this is a disease with significant unmet medical needs. Although onset occurs at any age, onset is most common in people aged 18 and younger and the elderly. As causes and clinical symptoms of pediatric epilepsy are not uniform, and prognoses can range from very positive cases to obstinate cases, special consideration for each patient is required of treatments.

52175,Roche's Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) Receives CHMP's Recommendation for Approval to Treat Influenza,CHMP recommends EU approval of Roche’s Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil) for the treatment of influenza,"The EMA’s CHMP has recommended the approval of Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza in patients aged ≥12yrs. Xofluza has also been recommended for approval as a preventive treatment (post-exposure prophylaxis) of influenza in individuals aged ≥12yrs.
 The CHMP recommendation is based on the results of the P-III CAPSTONE-1, CAPSTONE-2 and BLOCKSTONE studies. The company is expecting the EC’s final decision in approval in the near future
 Xofluza is the first in a class of antivirals designed to inhibit the cap-dependent endonuclease protein and is available in the US and in several other countries for influenza types A and B","Basel, 13 November 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended the approval of Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil) for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza in patients aged 12 years and above. In addition, Xofluza has been recommended for approval as a preventive treatment (post-exposure prophylaxis) of influenza in individuals aged 12 years and above. The CHMP recommendation is based on the results of the phase III CAPSTONE-1, CAPSTONE-2 and BLOCKSTONE studies.1,2,3 A final decision regarding the approval is expected from the European Commission in the near future.

“Today’s CHMP recommendation brings patients with influenza one step closer to potentially benefiting from Xofluza’s oral one-dose regimen, setting adults and adolescents on the path to feeling better sooner compared to placebo,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We believe that access to effective antivirals for influenza, and particularly their use in the prophylactic setting, could help reduce the strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare systems in Europe.”

Influenza is one of the most common, yet serious, infectious diseases, representing a significant threat to public health. Globally, seasonal epidemics result in three to five million cases of severe disease, millions of hospitalisations and up to 650,000 deaths every year.4,5,6 The WHO estimates that up to 72,000 people in the European region die prematurely due to causes associated with influenza each year.7 Antivirals, like Xofluza, are designed to target and treat the influenza virus.8,9,10

About CAPSTONE-11
CAPSTONE-1 was a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil) in 1,436 individuals aged 12 and above in the US and Japan. The primary endpoint of the study was time to alleviation of symptoms. The study found the following results:

Xofluza met its primary endpoint compared to placebo:
Significantly reduced the duration of influenza symptoms by more than one day (median time 53.7 hours versus 80.2 hours; p<0.001).
Similar efficacy results were seen between Xofluza and oseltamivir in relation to time to alleviation of symptoms (median time 53.5 hours versus 53.8 hours).
The most common adverse events reported were diarrhoea (3.0%), bronchitis (2.6%), nausea (1.3%) and sinusitis (1.1%), and all of these adverse events occurred at a lower frequency than placebo. The study was conducted in the US and Japan by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

About CAPSTONE-22
CAPSTONE-2 was a phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of one-dose of Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil) compared with placebo and oseltamivir in individuals aged 12 years and above who were at high-risk of complications from influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines people at high-risk for serious influenza complications to include adults 65 years of age or older, or those who have conditions such as asthma, chronic lung disease, morbid obesity, or heart disease. The study was conducted globally by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

A total of 2,184 participants enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to receive one, oral dose of 40mg or 80mg of Xofluza (according to body weight), placebo or 75mg of oseltamivir twice daily for five days. The predominant influenza virus in this study were the A/H3 subtype (46.9 to 48.8%) and influenza B subtype (38.3 to 43.5%). The most common risk factors were asthma or chronic lung disease (39.2%), age ≥65 years (27.4%), endocrine disorders (32.8%), metabolic disorders (13.5%), heart disease (12.7%), and morbid obesity (10.6%).

The primary objective of the study evaluated the efficacy of one-dose of Xofluza compared with placebo by measuring the time to improvement of influenza symptoms. CAPSTONE-2 was the first prospective, controlled phase III clinical trial to demonstrate a significant and clinically meaningful benefit from an antiviral medicine in people at high-risk of serious influenza complications (median time to improvement in symptoms 73.2 hours for Xofluza, 102.3 hours for placebo, p<0.0001).

About BLOCKSTONE3 
BLOCKSTONE was a phase III, double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, post-exposure prophylaxis study that evaluated one-dose of Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil) compared with placebo in household members (adults and children) who were living with someone with influenza confirmed by a rapid influenza diagnostic test (the ‘index patient’). The study was conducted by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. in Japan during the 2018-2019 influenza season.

Those diagnosed with influenza were required to have onset of symptoms for less than 48 hours and participants were required to have lived with those diagnosed for more than 48 hours. The participants were randomised to receive one-dose of Xofluza (dose according to body weight) or placebo as a preventive measure against developing influenza.

Xofluza showed a statistically significant prophylactic effect on influenza after one oral dose in people exposed to an infected household contact. The proportion of household members aged 12 years and above who developed influenza was 1.3% in participants treated with Xofluza and 13.2% in the placebo-treated group. Xofluza was well tolerated in this study and no new safety signals were identified.

About Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil)
Xofluza is a first-in-class, one-dose oral medicine with an innovative proposed mechanism of action that has demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of influenza viruses, including in vitro activity against oseltamivir-resistant strains and avian strains (H7N9, H5N1) in non-clinical studies.11,12,13 Xofluza is the first in a class of antivirals designed to inhibit the cap-dependent endonuclease protein, which is essential for viral replication.1,14

Xofluza is available in the US and in several other countries for the treatment of influenza types A and B. In the US, Xofluza is approved for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza in patients aged 12 years and above who are otherwise-healthy or at high-risk of developing serious complications from influenza, and who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. Xofluza was the first new antiviral to be approved by the FDA in 20 years.

Robust clinical evidence has demonstrated the benefit of Xofluza in several populations (otherwise-healthy, high-risk and post-exposure prophylaxis in individuals aged 12 years and above). Xofluza is being further studied in a phase III development programme, including children under the age of one (NCT03653364) as well as to assess the potential to reduce transmission of influenza from an infected person to healthy people (NCT03969212).1,2,3,15

Xofluza was discovered by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and is being further developed and commercialised globally in collaboration with the Roche Group (which includes Genentech in the US) and Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Under the terms of this agreement, Roche holds worldwide rights to Xofluza excluding Japan and Taiwan, which will be retained exclusively by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

52180,Eli Lilly Signs a License Agreement with Seed Therapeutics for Protein Degradation-Based Therapies,"BeyondSpring Subsidiary, Seed Therapeutics, Announces Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Lilly","Seed Therapeutics to receive $10M upfront, $10M equity investment, ~$780M as pre/clinical development, regulatory & commercial milestones along with royalties on net sales of products that emerges from the collaboration
 Seed utilizes molecular glue protein degradation technology to develop potential new therapies
 The agreement allows Seed to advance its platform to deliver new molecules targeting proteins that cause human diseases","NEW YORK, Nov. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Seed Therapeutics (“the Company”), a global research company and subsidiary of BeyondSpring focused on discovering and developing “molecular glues” to degrade disease-causing protein previously believed to be undruggable, announced today that it has entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”) to discover and develop new chemical entities (NCEs) that could produce therapeutic benefit through targeted protein degradation (TPD).

The TPD field allows for the targeting of hundreds of proteins that are known to be associated with human diseases but were previously thought to be undruggable. Seed Therapeutics has pioneered a strategy called “molecular glue” to induce the protein degrading machinery which is present in all cells to recognize and degrade the disease-causing protein that is not normally targeted for elimination. More importantly, Seed Therapeutics’ molecular glue program focuses on NCEs with more drug-like chemical properties, differentiated from the strategy of developing proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs).

Under the terms of the agreement, Seed Therapeutics will receive a $10 million upfront cash payment to fund research, as well as a $10 million equity investment from Lilly. Seed Therapeutics will also be eligible to receive up to approximately $780 million in potential pre-clinical and clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties on net sales of products that result from the collaboration. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.

“This agreement further allows us to advance our pioneering platform to deliver new molecules targeting proteins that cause human diseases,” added Dr. Lan Huang, CEO of both Seed Therapeutics and BeyondSpring. “Our alliance with Lilly is the catalyst for the world-class team at Seed Therapeutics to begin developing a pipeline of TPD therapies for diseases in which common strategies have failed.”

“Our pre-clinical research and licensing collaboration with Seed Therapeutics will enable both companies to better study the potential of targeted protein degradation to support the development of future medicines,” said Dr. Utpal Singh, Ph.D., Vice President of Discovery Chemistry at Lilly.

About Seed Therapeutics
Seed Therapeutics, a subsidiary of BeyondSpring (NASDAQ: BYSI), is a global research company focused on harnessing and engineering molecules that use “molecular glue” protein degradation to attack previously believed undruggable targets. Backed by a comprehensive intellectual property portfolio, Seed Therapeutics’ mission is to positively impact human health by creating novel protein degradation therapeutics for the treatment of various severe diseases that currently have limited options for patients and their families.

The great majority of approved treatments for human diseases act by binding molecular targets in or outside of cells to impact target-related signaling or actions. The cellular targets of drugs and drug candidates discovered with this typical strategy are predominately proteins, the work-horse of cells that, when gone astray, contribute to disease onset and / or progression. Importantly, less than 30 percent of proteins thought to be involved in diseases are likely to be “druggable” utilizing this drug development strategy. Therapeutic development in many serious indications has, therefore, suffered due to a lack of proteins that are druggable, rather than being due to a lack of understanding the biology of the disease.

Seed Therapeutics is overcoming this challenge by developing novel therapies that aim to inhibit the function of disease-causing proteins, or proteins responsible for resistance to other therapies, by inducing specific degradation of the protein using novel E3s. This groundbreaking strategy has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to hundreds of thousands of patients suffering from serious conditions, as diverse as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Through ongoing collaborations with world-leading academic experts in the field, and in partnership with seasoned drug development and commercialization experts at the parent company, BeyondSpring, Seed Therapeutics is establishing a growing pipeline of novel drug candidates on a path to clinical and commercial success.

52186,"Henlius Report the NMPA's Acceptance of HLX15 (biosimilar, Daratumumab) to Treat Multiple Myeloma",The IND Application of Henlius Daratumumab Biosimilar Accepted by NMPA,"The NMPA has accepted HLX15’s IND to be used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. HLX15 is Henlius’ second self-developed product around blood tumor treatment
 The company evaluated the biosimilar in a head to head clinical studies demonstrating that HLX15 is highly similar to its reference daratumumab while the safety profiles are also similar
 The company has developed the HLX15 in accordance with the technical guidelines of development and evaluation of biosimilar drugs and EMA guideline on similar biological medicinal products","Shanghai, China, Nov, 12th, 2020 – Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that the Investigational New Drug (IND) application of the Company’s daratumumab biosimilar HLX15 (a recombinant anti-CD38 fully human monoclonal antibody injection) to be used in the treatment of multiple myeloma has been accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). HLX15 is the Company’s second self-developed product in the area of blood tumor treatment.
Multiple Myeloma is the second most common cancer among all types of hematologic malignancies and accounts for approximately 10% of hematologic malignant cases. Multiple myeloma is characterized by proliferative disorder of bone marrow plasma cells that can lead to bone marrow damage[1] . High expression of CD38 is present in all stages along disease progression of multiple myeloma. Considering the expression profile of CD38, it is thought to be an ideal target for the treatment of multiple myeloma[2-3]. HLX15 is a fully human anti-CD38 IgG1κ monoclonal antibody with unique mechanisms for cancer cell killing. On one hand, HLX15 can directly bind to CD38 expressed on the surface of tumor cells, inducing tumor cell lysis and apoptosis through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and several other pathways such as Fc mediated cross linking to achieve a quick response of tumor cells. In addition, a subset of myeloid derived suppressor cells (CD38+MDSCs), regulatory T cells (CD38+Tregs) and B cells (CD38+Bregs) are decreased by daratumumab. Clinical studies have shown that daratumumab is effective in slowing down disease progression in patients with multiple myeloma and can significantly prolong patient progression free survival (PFS) and overall survial[4] . Daratumumab has been approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma adult patients by NMPA and its combinations have also been approved for the treatment of first-line and second-line and above multiple myeloma patients globally. According to estimates from IQVIA, total sales of daratumumab worldwide has reached USD 2.8 billion, indicating a huge medical needs for this drug.
In accordance with the Technical Guidelines of Development and Evaluation of Biosimilar Drugs and EMA Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products, HLX15 has been developed strictly following the principles of stepwise development, comparability and similarity assessment and has been compared head to head with reference daratumumab via analytical studies and preclinical studies. The results of these studies showed that HLX15 is highly similar to reference daratumumab, and the safety profiles is similar.
In February 2019, 汉利康Ⓡ, Henlius’ first product in the field of hematologic malignancies, also the first domestic monoclonal antibody developed in accordance with Chinese Biosimilar Guidelines has been approved by the NMPA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and other hematologic tumors. Henceforth, 汉利康Ⓡhas benefited an increasing number of blood tumor patients in China. With the development of HLX15, Henlius will not only extend its enriched portfolio, but provide an alternative high-quality treatment option for multiple myeloma patients and alleviate the high cost of imported drugs and reduce the economic burden of patients. Looking forward, Henlius will continue advancing the development of innovative biologics on the basis of its established and integrated innovation platform, underscoring its long-term commitment to providing affordable and effective therapies for patients worldwide.

52210,Moderna's mRNA-1273 Demonstrates 94.5% Efficacy in Preventing Symptomatic COVID-19,Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Meets its Primary Efficacy Endpoint in the First Interim Analysis of the Phase 3 COVE Study,"The P-lll COVE study involves the assessing of mRNA-1273 (100 µg dose level) in 30,000 patients with COVID-19 in the ratio of (1:1) aged > 18 yrs. in the US
 The study met the statistical criteria pre-specified in the study protocol for efficacy, with a vaccine efficacy of 94.5% in the first interim analysis of the P-III COVE study. The first interim analysis included 95 participants with confirmed cases of COVID-19
 Moderna plans to submit a EUA with US FDA in the coming weeks and expects the EUA to be based on the final analysis of 151 cases and a median follow-up of >2mos.","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Moderna, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced that the independent, NIH-appointed Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273, its vaccine candidate against COVID-19, has informed Moderna that the trial has met the statistical criteria pre-specified in the study protocol for efficacy, with a vaccine efficacy of 94.5%. This study, known as the COVE study, enrolled more than 30,000 participants in the U.S. and is being conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 COVE study is based on the analysis of COVID-19 cases confirmed and adjudicated starting two weeks following the second dose of vaccine. This first interim analysis was based on 95 cases, of which 90 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 5 cases observed in the mRNA-1273 group, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 94.5% (p <0.0001).

A secondary endpoint analyzed severe cases of COVID-19 and included 11 severe cases (as defined in the study protocol) in this first interim analysis. All 11 cases occurred in the placebo group and none in the mRNA-1273 vaccinated group.

The 95 COVID-19 cases included 15 older adults (ages 65+) and 20 participants identifying as being from diverse communities (including 12 Hispanic or LatinX, 4 Black or African Americans, 3 Asian Americans and 1 multiracial).

The interim analysis included a concurrent review of the available Phase 3 COVE study safety data by the DSMB, which did not report any significant safety concerns. A review of solicited adverse events indicated that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Grade 3 (severe) events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first dose included injection site pain (2.7%), and after the second dose included fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), headache (4.5%), pain (4.1%) and erythema/redness at the injection site (2.0%). These solicited adverse events were generally short-lived. These data are subject to change based on ongoing analysis of further Phase 3 COVE study data and final analysis.

Preliminary analysis suggests a broadly consistent safety and efficacy profile across all evaluated subgroups.

As more cases accrue leading up to the final analysis, the Company expects the point estimate for vaccine efficacy may change. The Company plans to submit data from the full Phase 3 COVE study to a peer-reviewed publication.

“This is a pivotal moment in the development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Since early January, we have chased this virus with the intent to protect as many people around the world as possible. All along, we have known that each day matters. This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease, including severe disease,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “This milestone is only possible because of the hard work and sacrifices of so many. I want to thank the thousands of participants in our Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, and the staff at our clinical trial sites who have been on the front lines of the fight against the virus. They are an inspiration to us all. I want to thank the NIH, particularly NIAID, for their scientific leadership including through years of foundational research on potential pandemic threats at the Vaccine Research Center that led to the discovery of the best way to make Spike protein antigens that are being used in our vaccine and others’. I want to thank our partners at BARDA and Operation Warp Speed who have been instrumental to accelerating our progress to this point. Finally, I want to thank the Moderna team, our suppliers and our partners, for their tireless work across research, development and manufacturing of the vaccine. We look forward to the next milestones of submitting for an EUA in the U.S., and regulatory filings in countries around the world, while we continue to collect data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in the COVE study. We remain committed to and focused on doing our part to help end the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Based on these interim safety and efficacy data, Moderna intends to submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks and anticipates having the EUA informed by the final safety and efficacy data (with a median duration of at least 2 months). Moderna also plans to submit applications for authorizations to global regulatory agencies.

Moderna is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Operation Warp Speed and McKesson (NYSE: MCK), a COVID-19 vaccine distributor contracted by the U.S. government, as well as global stakeholders to be prepared for distribution of mRNA-1273, in the event that it receives an EUA and similar global authorizations. By the end of 2020, the Company expects to have approximately 20 million doses of mRNA-1273 ready to ship in the U.S. The Company remains on track to manufacture 500 million to 1 billion doses globally in 2021. On November 10, the American Medical Association (AMA) issued a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code to report vaccination with mRNA-1273 (code: 91301). Moderna recently announced further progress towards ensuring the distribution, storage and handling of the vaccine can be done using existing infrastructure.

About the Phase 3 COVE Study

The Phase 3 COVE trial is a randomized, 1:1 placebo-controlled study testing mRNA-1273 at the 100 µg dose level in 30,000 participants in the U.S., ages 18 and older. The primary endpoint is the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease. Key secondary endpoints include prevention of severe COVID-19 disease and prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2. The trial will continue to accrue additional data relevant to safety and efficacy even after an EUA is submitted. The final estimates of vaccine efficacy for both primary and secondary endpoints will depend on the totality of data that will accumulate to inform the final analysis. Moderna worked closely with BARDA and the NIH, including NIAID’s COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN), to conduct the Phase 3 COVE study under Operation Warp Speed. Moderna’s partner PPD (Nasdaq: PPD), a leading global contract research organization providing comprehensive, integrated drug development, laboratory and lifecycle management services, has also been essential to the successful execution of the COVE study.

The Phase 3 COVE study was designed in collaboration with the FDA and NIH to evaluate Americans at risk of severe COVID-19 disease and completed enrollment of 30,000 participants ages 18 and older in the U.S. on October 22, including those at high risk of the severe complications of COVID-19 disease. The COVE study includes more than 7,000 Americans over the age of 65. It also includes more than 5,000 Americans who are under the age of 65 but have high-risk chronic diseases that put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19, such as diabetes, severe obesity and cardiac disease. These medically high-risk groups represent 42% of the total participants in the Phase 3 COVE study. The study also included communities that have historically been under-represented in clinical research and have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The study includes more than 11,000 participants from communities of color, representing 37% of the study population, which is similar to the diversity of the U.S. at large. This includes more than 6,000 participants who identify as Hispanic or LatinX, and more than 3,000 participants who identify as Black or African American.

About mRNA-1273

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was co-developed by Moderna and investigators from NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to the NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing. On May 12, the FDA granted mRNA-1273 Fast Track designation. On May 29, the first participants in each age cohort: adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300) were dosed in the Phase 2 study of mRNA-1273. On July 8, the Phase 2 study completed enrollment.

Results from the second interim analysis of the NIH-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups were published on September 29 in The New England Journal of Medicine. On July 28, results from a non-human primate preclinical viral challenge study evaluating mRNA-1273 were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. On July 14, an interim analysis of the original cohorts in the NIH-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. mRNA-1273 currently is not approved for use by any regulatory body.

BARDA is supporting the continued research and development of mRNA-1273 with $955 million in federal funding under Contract no. 75A50120C00034. BARDA is reimbursing Moderna for 100 percent of the allowable costs incurred by the Company for conducting the program described in the BARDA contract.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia & BURLINGAME, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Zymeworks Inc. (NYSE: ZYME), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing multifunctional biotherapeutics,and ALX Oncology Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXO), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company developing therapies that block the CD47 checkpoint pathway, today announced they have entered into a clinical collaboration to evaluate the combination of Zymeworks’ zanidatamab (formerly ZW25), a HER2-targeted bispecific antibody, and ALX148, a next-generation CD47 blocker, for the treatment of patients with advanced HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201116005959/en/

Under the terms of the agreement, Zymeworks will conduct an open label, multi-center Phase 1b study to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of zanidatamab and ALX148 in a two-part study. The first part of the trial will evaluate the safety of the combination treatment. The second part of the trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of the combination in separate cohorts of subjects with HER2-positive breast cancer, HER2-low breast cancer, and non-breast HER2-expressing solid tumors.

“In addition to broad anti-tumor activity, zanidatamab’s safety profile supports combination approaches with other therapeutics,” said Diana Hausman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Zymeworks. “Our collaboration with ALX Oncology and their CD47 blocker, ALX148, has the potential to further expand the opportunity for zanidatamab to provide benefit to a broader population of patients, including those with advanced HER2‑expressing breast cancer.”

Zanidatamab is designed to have multiple mechanisms of action, including immune clearance of HER2-expressing tumor cells by macrophages through antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). CD47 is a “don’t eat me” signal that acts as a checkpoint inhibitor to macrophages. Cancer cells that express CD47 are resistant to immune clearance even when targeted with therapeutic antibodies. Treatment with zanidatamab plus ALX148 has the potential to increase the immune clearance of HER2-expressing cancer cells by combining a biparatopic antibody capable of binding at higher density than monospecific antibodies with a molecule that blocks CD47 on the same targeted cancer cells.

“We are excited about this collaboration with Zymeworks that combines two promising next-generation anti-cancer agents, a HER2-targeted bispecific antibody with a CD47 blocker, to enhance their potential activity in treating patients with advanced breast cancer,” said Jaume Pons, Ph.D., Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of ALX Oncology. “ALX148 was designed for safe use in combination to maximize clinical activity with a range of anti-cancer agents. This collaboration builds on the promising anti-tumor activity observed in clinical trials of ALX148 combined with a HER2-targeted therapy in patients with advanced HER2-positive gastric and gastroesophageal cancer.”

Zanidatamab is in advanced clinical development, actively enrolling a pivotal study in patients with previously-treated HER2 gene-amplified biliary tract cancer. In addition, five active Phase 2 programs are underway, and Zymeworks plans to initiate a second pivotal study for zanidatamab as first-line treatment for advanced HER2‑positive gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas.

Phase 1 studies of ALX148 have been conducted in combination with tumor antigen targeted antibodies, a checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy. Preliminary results from ASPEN-01, the ALX148 Phase 1b study, were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s 35th Anniversary Annual Meeting [abstract 404]. ALX148 displayed promising initial clinical activity in patients with solid tumors, including advanced HER2-positive gastric and gastroesophageal cancer where ALX148 was well tolerated in combination with an anti-HER2 specific antibody and chemotherapy with no maximum tolerated dose reached. ALX Oncology plans to continue the advancement of ALX148 as a potential treatment for a range of solid tumor indications and is currently also in development in patients with higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes (ASPEN-02).

52231,Johnson &amp; Johnson Initiates Second Global P-III Study of its COVID-19 Vaccine,Johnson & Johnson Initiates Second Global Phase 3 Clinical Trial of its Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate,"In addition to the single-dose regimen ENSEMBLE study, Janssen has now initiated the two-dose regimen ENSEMBLE 2 trial in collaboration with the UK NIHR
 The P-lll ENSEMBLE 2 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a two-dose regimen of the investigational Janssen vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in ~30,000 patients across the globe. The ENSEMBLE and ENSEMBLE 2 trials will run in parallel
 The two P-III studies follow positive interim results of P-I/IIa study assessing the safety profile and immunogenicity of both a single-dose/ two-dose vaccination","November 15, 2020 — The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study of the single-dose regimen of JNJ-78436735, the investigational vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19 being developed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, continues to enroll and vaccinate study participants. ENSEMBLE is proceeding to enroll up to 60,000 participants worldwide.

In addition to the single-dose regimen ENSEMBLE study, Janssen has now initiated the two-dose regimen ENSEMBLE 2 trial. ENSEMBLE 2 is a complementary, planned, pivotal, large-scale, multi-country Phase 3 trial that will study the safety and efficacy of a two-dose regimen of the investigational Janssen vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19 in up to 30,000 participants worldwide. The ENSEMBLE and ENSEMBLE 2 trials will run in parallel.

While a potentially safe and effective single-dose preventive COVID-19 vaccine would have significant benefits, particularly in a pandemic setting, Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine program has been designed to be extremely thorough and driven by science. As such, we are investigating multiple doses and dosing regimens to evaluate their long-term efficacy.

The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE and ENSEMBLE 2 trials follow positive interim results from the Company’s ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical study, which is studying the safety profile and immunogenicity of both a single-dose and two-dose vaccination. The interim analysis showed that a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate induced a robust immune response and was generally well-tolerated.

PHASE 3 ENSEMBLE 2 STUDY

The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE 2 study (NCT04614948) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a two-dose vaccine regimen versus placebo in adults 18 years old and older with and without comorbidities associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19. The study will assess efficacy of the investigational vaccine after both the first and second dose to evaluate protection against the virus and potential incremental benefits for duration of protection with a second dose.

Janssen will aim to enroll participants in Belgium, Colombia, France, Germany, the Philippines, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. In order to evaluate the efficacy of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, clinical trial sites in countries and areas with high incidence of COVID-19 and the ability to achieve a rapid initiation were selected.

ENSEMBLE 2 is being conducted in collaboration with the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).

The Company is committed to transparency and sharing information related to the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE 2 study.

JANSSEN’S INVESTIGATIONAL COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATE

The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate leverages the Company’s AdVac® technology platform, which was also used to develop and manufacture Janssen’s European Commission-approved Ebola vaccine and construct its Zika, RSV, and HIV investigational vaccine candidates. Janssen’s AdVac® technology platform has been used to vaccinate more than 110,000 people to date across Janssen’s investigational vaccine programs.

52237,QBiotics' Stelfonta (tigilanol tiglate) Receives the US FDA's Approval as the First Treatment for Non-Metastatic MCT in Dogs,FDA approves registration of STELFONTA®,"The approval is based on a study supporting its safety, efficacy in dogs with a measurable cutaneous/ SC MCT on the lower leg and follows the EMA’s MAA granted in early 2020
 Stelfonta provides 75% complete tumor resolution after just one injection, and dogs quickly regain pre-treatment QoL. The therapy will be launched in the US in the coming months and then made available to primary care veterinarians from early 2021
 QBiotics is currently investigating Stelfonta in a series of human P-I & P-II clinical trials targeting solid tumors as both as monothx. and an immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy","STELFONTA (tigilanol tiglate injection) is now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine for the treatment of non-metastatic mast cell tumours (MCT) in dogs, making it the first pharmaceutical treatment available for all grades of canine non-metastatic MCT1

FDA approval follows the early 2020 marketing authorisation of STELFONTA by the European Medicines Agency, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate in the United Kingdom and Swissmedic, then subsequent sales in all major markets across Europe
Approval for STELFONTA is based on a full data package supporting its safety, efficacy and manufacture. This included a QBiotics sponsored, pivotal, multi centre, randomised, blinded and untreated control study in 123 canine patients with MCT where 75% of canine patients achieved complete tumour resolution (‘Complete Response’) after a single treatment of STELFONTA.2
STELFONTA will be launched with U.S. veterinary oncologists in the coming months, and then made available to primary care veterinarians from early 2021 via QBiotics’ marketing and distribution partner, the global animal health company Virbac
QBiotics is also currently investigating tigilanol tiglate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in STELFONTA, in a series of human Phase I and II clinical trials targeting solid tumours as both a monotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy.
BRISBANE, 17 November 2020. QBiotics Group Limited (QBiotics), a life sciences company developing novel anticancer and wound healing pharmaceuticals, is delighted to announce that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (U.S. FDA) Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has approved its lead veterinary anticancer product, STELFONTA, making it the first FDA approved treatment for all grades of canine non-metastatic mast cell tumours. The news follows approvals for STELFONTA in early 2020 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the United Kingdoms’s Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), and Swissmedic, with subsequent sales in all major European markets.

In the United States, STELFONTA (tigilanol tiglate injection) is indicated for the treatment of all non-metastatic cutaneous MCT and non-metastatic subcutaneous MCT, located at or distal to the elbow or the hock in dogs. MCTs are the most frequently diagnosed cancer in dogs, accounting for up to 21% of skin cancer cases3.

Dr Chad Johannes, Assistant Professor of Oncology at Iowa State University, and consultant to QBiotics commented, “STELFONTA brings a novel therapeutic mechanism and intratumoural delivery route to veterinary medicine. The efficacy and durability of response data in dogs with mast cell tumours are very promising. While surgery will remain the mainstay, I do think STELFONTA will reshape how we approach local mast cell tumour control in many ways.”

Dr Victoria Gordon, CEO and Managing Director of QBiotics, said, “FDA approval is a pivotal achievement for both STELFONTA and QBiotics. STELFONTA has the potential to be a category igniter – given it is easy to administer, provides 75% complete tumour resolution after just one injection, and dogs quickly regain pre-treatment quality of life. European sales of STELFONTA have been impressive,and we are excited to be working with Virbac to bring the drug to the US market to help treat the 3 million dogs there that each year are diagnosed with cancer.”

Dr Gordon continued, “this approval also provides strong validation of our highly efficient business model, where veterinary product sales provide repeatable revenue for the company, and the strong veterinary data underpins our human drug development programme. Clinical efficacy and safety responses reported in canine patients are also being mirrored in our human patients. In a Phase I/IIa human safety trial, tigilanol tiglate, the active ingredient in STELFONTA, demonstrated antitumour responses in a range of solid tumours. This included complete responses (where the tumour is completely destroyed) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. Notably, a maximum tolerated dose was not declared for this study. We are currently investigating the drug’s potential as both a monotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy through a series of Phase II clinical trials.”

Tigilanol tiglate is a small molecule that largely acts through specific protein kinase C (PKC) activation4, leading to rapid destruction of the tumour mass and the tumour’s blood supply, as well as stimulation of the immune system. Tumour destruction is followed by rapid healing of the site with minimal scarring.

QBiotics and its partner, Virbac, a global animal health company, will first launch STELFONTA to specialist U.S. veterinary oncologists over the coming months, followed by the launch to primary care veterinarians in early 2021.

52277,Bayer's Finerenone Demonstrates Positive Outcomes in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease and Type 2 Diabetes,Finerenone showed consistent benefits on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes with or without history of cardiovascular disease,"The P-III FIDELIO-DKD study in CKD and T2D enrolled over 13,000 patients with early kidney damage and more advanced stages of kidney disease. The data were presented at the ASN Kidney Week 2020 and published in the NEJM based on which Bayer submitted finerenone for marketing authorization in the US and the EU
 Results: Finerenone reduced the key secondary composite CV endpoint consistently in patients with CKD and T2D, with or without history of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, it reduced the non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure by 14%
 Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is an investigational novel, non-steroidal, selective MRA that has been shown to block many of the harmful effects of MR overactivation which mainly causes kidney and CV damage through inflammatory and fibrotic processes","In the FIDELIO-DKD Phase III study among patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, overall finerenone significantly lowered the combined risk of cardiovascular events, with comparable treatment efficacy for patients with or without history of cardiovascular disease / People with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes are three times more likely to die from a cardiovascular-related cause than those with type 2 diabetes alone / Finerenone is a first-in-class investigational non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist that specifically addresses MR overactivation, a key driver of disease progression
Berlin, November 17, 2020 – Late-breaking data from the Phase III FIDELIO-DKD study indicate that compared to placebo, finerenone reduced the key secondary composite cardiovascular (CV) endpoint consistently in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), with or without history of cardiovascular disease. This new subgroup analysis underscores the potential role of finerenone in both primary and secondary CV prevention in these patients.

The prespecified subgroup analysis of FIDELIO-DKD, presented as a late-breaker at the American Heart Association’s (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2020, and simultaneously published in Circulation, further adds to the recently published results of the FIDELIO-DKD trial, which demonstrated that compared to placebo, finerenone significantly reduced the risk of the key secondary CV endpoint, a composite CV outcome of time to CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction MI, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure by 14%. The overall significant and clinically meaningful effect of finerenone on the hazard ratio of the composite CV outcome was not modified by a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), (p-value for interaction: 0.85).

· Of the patients with a history of CVD, the composite CV outcome occurred in 231 (17.7%) patients in the finerenone group and 263 (20.2%) patients in the placebo group (incidence rate per 100 patient-years 7.18 and 8.5, respectively; HR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.71–1.02]).

· Of the patients without a history of CVD, the composite CV outcome occurred in 136 (8.9%) patients in the finerenone group and 157 (10.2%) patients in the placebo group (incidence rate per 100 patient-years 3.43 and 3.92, respectively; HR 0.86 [95% CI, 0.68–1.08]).

“Patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes are not only at high risk of progression to kidney failure, they are also exposed to a higher risk of cardiovascular events – and face substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,” said Gerasimos Filippatos, M.D., Professor of cardiology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece, and co-principal investigator of FIDELIO-DKD. “These new findings from the FIDELIO-DKD study suggest the potential of finerenone as a new treatment option to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, irrespective of whether patients had a history of cardiovascular disease.”

Results were consistent across subgroups of history of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, MI and/or ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between the finerenone and the placebo arm, irrespective of CVD history. Overall, finerenone was shown to be well-tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate. The frequency of serious adverse events was lower in patients treated with finerenone (31.9%) compared to placebo (34.3%). Overall, hyperkalemia-related adverse events occurred more often in patients receiving finerenone compared with placebo (18.3% and 9%, respectively).

“Finerenone could potentially offer a streamlined approach to addressing cardiovascular risk across this vulnerable patient population,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceutical Division and Head of Research and Development. “We look forward to future milestones from the finerenone Phase III studies FIGARO-DKD, and FINEARTS-HF, which will deepen our understanding of the role of finerenone as a potential new disease-modifying strategy to help protect patients with earlier stages of chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, or symptomatic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥40%, by reducing the risk of cardiovascular events.”

The FIDELIO-DKD data were presented in October at the American Society of Nephrology’s (ASN) Kidney Week 2020, and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Based on these data, Bayer submitted finerenone for marketing authorization in the U.S. and the EU.

About Finerenone
Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is an investigational novel, non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that has been shown to block many of the harmful effects of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation. MR overactivation is a major driver of kidney and cardiovascular damage through inflammatory and fibrotic processes.

The Phase III program with finerenone in CKD and T2D enrolled over 13,000 patients across a broad range of disease severity including those with early kidney damage and more advanced stages of kidney disease. It is the largest Phase III clinical trial program to date in CKD and T2D and comprises two studies, evaluating the effect of finerenone versus placebo on top of standard of care on both renal and cardiovascular outcomes.

FIDELIO-DKD (FInerenone in reducing kiDnEy faiLure and dIsease prOgression in Diabetic Kidney Disease) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, event-driven Phase III study that investigated the efficacy and safety of finerenone in comparison to placebo in addition to standard of care on the reduction of kidney failure and kidney disease progression in approximately 5,700 patients with CKD and T2D from more than 1,000 sites across 48 countries worldwide. Patients with a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (NYHA II-IV) were excluded. Finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg orally once daily when added to standard of care, including blood glucose lowering therapies and a maximum tolerated dose of a RAS-blocking therapy such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), significantly reduced the combined risk of time to kidney failure, a sustained decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 40% from baseline over a period of at least four weeks, or renal death by 18% (relative risk reduction; HR 0.82 [95% CI, 0.73-0.93; p=0.0014]) over a median duration of follow-up of 2.6 years. Finerenone also significantly reduced the risk of the key secondary endpoint, a composite of time to cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure compared to placebo by 14% (relative risk reduction, HR 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.99; p=0.0339]) over a median duration of follow-up of 2.6 years.

FIGARO-DKD (FInerenone in reducinG cArdiovascular moRtality and mOrbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease) is still ongoing and is investigating the efficacy and safety of finerenone versus placebo in addition to standard of care on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in approximately 7,400 patients with CKD and T2D across 47 countries including sites in Europe, Japan, China and the U.S.

Bayer also recently announced the initiation of the FINEARTS-HF study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study which will investigate finerenone compared to placebo in more than 5,500 symptomatic heart failure patients (New York Heart Association class II-IV) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥40%. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of finerenone over placebo in reducing the rate of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure (HF) events (defined as hospitalizations for HF or urgent HF visits).

About Chronic Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetes
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a deadly condition that is underrecognized. CKD is one of the most frequent complications arising from diabetes and is also an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. Approximately 40% of all patients with type 2 diabetes develop chronic kidney disease. Despite guideline-directed therapies, patients with CKD and T2D remain at high risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events. It is estimated that CKD affects more than 160 million people with T2D worldwide. Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes is the main cause of end stage kidney disease which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive. MR over-activation is known to trigger detrimental processes (e.g. inflammation and fibrosis) in kidneys and heart in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

52288,ViiV Healthcare's Cabotegravir Receives US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation for HIV Prevention,"ViiV Healthcare receives FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for investigational, long-acting cabotegravir for HIV prevention","This BT designation is based on P-IIb/III HPTN 083 study assessing cabotegravir (q8w) vs. FTC/TDF tablets (qd PO, 200/300 mg) in a study population of 4,566 for HIV prevention. The data were presented at the 23rd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2020)
 Results: HPTN 083 study showed that cabotegravir was 66% more effective at preventing HIV compared to daily oral FTC/TDF tablets. The HIV incidence rate is 0.41% in the cabotegravir group and 1.22% in the FTC/TDF group
 A partner HIV prevention study (HPTN 084) in sub-Saharan African women was stopped earlier this month based upon recommendation of the independent DSMB following the superioriority of cabotegravir to oral FTC/TDF tablets. The company plans to use the data from both the HPTN studies for future regulatory submissions","London, 17 November 2020 – ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”), with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for long-acting, injectable cabotegravir for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation was based on efficacy and safety results from HPTN 083, a phase IIb/III randomised, multicentre, double-blind, clinical trial that compared long-acting, injectable cabotegravir to daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 200 mg and 300 mg (FTC/TDF) for HIV prevention among men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men.

Final analysis of HPTN 083 showed the superiority of long-acting cabotegravir, which was 66% more effective at preventing HIV when compared to daily oral FTC/TDF tablets. This translated to an HIV incidence rate of 0.41% in the cabotegravir group (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22%-0.69%) and 1.22% in the FTC/TDF group (95% CI 0.87%-1.67%) in a study population of 4,566. The results of HPTN 083 were presented at the 23rd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2020) in July. The blinded phase of HPTN 084, a partner HIV prevention study in sub-Saharan African women, was stopped earlier this month based upon recommendation of the independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) following demonstration that long-acting cabotegravir was superior to oral FTC/TDF tablets. ViiV Healthcare plans to use the data from both HPTN studies for future regulatory submissions.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that address serious or life-threatening medical conditions. The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy Designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates a drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapies. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation means closer and more frequent collaboration with the FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support its approval.

Kimberly Smith, M.D., MPH, Head of Research & Development at ViiV Healthcare, said: “New medicines that decrease the risk of HIV acquisition in at-risk populations are an essential tool to help us end the global HIV epidemic. Our data from the HPTN 083 and 084 studies show that long-acting cabotegravir is superior to daily oral FTC/TDF tablets for HIV prevention. We are looking forward to working closely with the FDA to make this prevention option available to people at risk of acquiring HIV.”

HIV continues to be a global public health crisis, with an estimated 38 million people living with HIV and 1.7 million new cases of HIV at the end of 2019. Advancements in research and development have identified new approaches to HIV treatment and prevention, such as long-acting cabotegravir.

The FDA decision date for avalglucosidase alfa, an investigational enzyme replacement therapy, is set for May 18, 2021
Regulatory submission based on positive data from two trials in patients with late-onset and infantile-onset Pompe disease, respectively
Avalglucosidase alfa received FDA Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations for the treatment of people with Pompe Disease
Pompe disease, a rare degenerative muscle disorder, affects approximately 3,500 people in the U.S.
Milestone reinforces 20+year commitment to Pompe disease community
PARIS – November 18, 2020 – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for avalglucosidase alfa for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase deficiency). The target action date for the FDA decision is May 18, 2021.

Avalglucosidase alfa is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy designed to improve the delivery of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme to muscle cells, and if approved, would offer a potential new standard of care for patients with Pompe disease.

In October, the European Medicines Agency accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application for avalglucosidase alfa for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the UK has granted Promising Innovative Medicine designation for avalglucosidase alfa.

“The hallmarks of Pompe disease are the relentless and debilitating deterioration of the muscles, which causes decreased respiratory function and mobility,” said Karin Knobe, Head of Development for Rare Diseases and Rare Blood Disorders at Sanofi. “Avalglucosidase alfa is specifically designed to deliver more GAA enzyme into the lysosomes of the muscle cells. We have been greatly encouraged by positive clinical trial results in patients with late-onset and infantile-onset Pompe disease.”

Pompe disease is a rare, degenerative muscle disorder that can impact an individual’s ability to move and breathe. It affects an estimated 3,500 people in the U.S. and can manifest at any age from infancy to late adulthood.i

The BLA is based on positive data from two trials:

Pivotal Phase 3, double-blind, global comparator-controlled trial (COMET), which evaluated the safety and efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa compared to alglucosidase alfa (standard of care) in patients with late-onset Pompe disease. Results from this trial were presented during a Sanofi-hosted virtual scientific session in June 2020 and in October 2020 at World Muscle Society and the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine.
The Phase 2 (mini-COMET) trial evaluated the safety and exploratory efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease previously treated with alglucosidase alfa. Results from this trial were presented at the WORLDSymposium, in February 2020.
Delivery of GAA to Clear Glycogen

Pompe disease is caused by a genetic deficiency or dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme GAA, which results in build-up of complex sugars (glycogen) in muscle cells throughout the body. The accumulation of glycogen leads to irreversible damage to the muscles, including respiratory muscles and the diaphragm muscle supporting lung function, and other skeletal muscles that affect mobility.

To reduce the glycogen accumulation caused by Pompe disease, the GAA enzyme must be delivered into the lysosomes within muscle cells. Research led by Sanofi has focused on ways to enhance the delivery of GAA into the lysosomes of muscle cells by targeting the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor that plays a key role in the transport of GAA.

Avalglucosidase alfa is designed with approximately 15-fold increase in M6P content, compared to standard of care alglucosidase alfa, and aims to help improve cellular enzyme uptake and enhance glycogen clearance in target tissues.ii The clinical relevance of this difference has not been confirmed.

Avalglucosidase alfa is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority worldwide.

52306,"Pfizer Launches US Pilot Programme for Delivery and Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccine, BNT162b2",PFIZER UPDATE ON OUR U.S. COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATE DISTRIBUTION PREPAREDNESS,"Pfizer launched a pilot program to support the state’s planning, deployment & administration of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, to build on coordination with the relevant US agencies
 Pfizer has been working with US officials in OWS & the US CDC to help ensure that after potential authorization or approval, the Pfizer-bioNtech COVID-19 vaccine can reach those in most need as quickly and equitably as possible
 The BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world, both collaborators are committed to developing these novel vaccines with preclinical & clinical data at the forefront of all their decision making","NEW YORK, 16 November 2020 — Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) today announced the U.S. COVID-19 Immunization Pilot Program with four states, to help refine the plan for the delivery and deployment of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate that is being co-developed with BioNTech.

To build on our coordination with the relevant U.S. agencies, Pfizer launched this pilot program to help better support the states’ planning, deployment, and administration of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Learnings from this program will be adapted for usage across other states to help them create effective immunization programs for this vaccine. The four states – Rhode Island, Texas, New Mexico, and Tennessee – were selected for the program because of their differences in overall size, diversity of populations, and immunization infrastructure, as well as the states’ need to reach individuals in varied urban and rural settings. The four states included in this pilot program will not receive vaccine doses earlier than other states by virtue of this pilot, nor will they receive any differential consideration.

Pfizer has been working with U.S. officials in Operation Warp Speed (OWS) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help ensure that after potential authorization or approval, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine can reach those in most need as quickly and equitably as possible. The company believes this ongoing coordination is critical to help ensure an efficient vaccine distribution as soon as possible after the vaccine receives regulatory authorization or approval, if received.

“This pilot program and our collaboration with U.S. and state officials will help us prepare for broader vaccine deployment in the near future, subject to authorization or approval, as we work to address this urgent public health need,” said Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Bio Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group. “We are hopeful that results from this vaccine delivery pilot will serve as the model for other U.S. states and international governments, as they prepare to implement effective COVID-19 vaccine programs.”

In July, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the execution of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense to meet the U.S. government’s OWS program goal to begin delivering 300 million doses of a vaccine for COVID-19 in 2021. Under the agreement, the U.S. government will first receive 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after Pfizer successfully manufactures and obtains approval or emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The U.S. government will pay $1.95 billion for those first 100 million doses, with the option to acquire up to an additional 500 million doses.

Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine development and manufacturing costs have been entirely self-funded, with billions of dollars already invested at risk. The company will continue bearing all the costs of development and manufacturing in an effort to help find a solution to this pandemic as fast as possible.

The BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine development program is a collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech. It is not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world. Both collaborators are committed to developing these novel vaccines with preclinical and clinical data at the forefront of all their decision making.

About the BNT162 Vaccine Candidate Program

The BNT162 program is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and supported by Pfizer’s global vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities. Two of the companies’ four investigational vaccine candidates – BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 – received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), based on preliminary data from Phase 1/2 studies that are currently ongoing in the U.S. and Germany as well as animal immunogenicity studies. During preclinical and clinical studies, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 emerged as strong candidates based on assessments of safety and immune response.

On November 9, 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced their mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, against SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated evidence of efficacy against COVID-19 in participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on the first interim efficacy analysis conducted on November 8, 2020 by an external, independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) from the Phase 3 clinical study. The DMC reviewed 94 cases. The case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates a vaccine efficacy rate above 90%, at 7 days after the second dose. This means that protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the vaccination, which consists of a 2-dose schedule. As the study continues, the final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. The DMC has not reported any serious safety concerns and recommends that the study continue to collect additional safety and efficacy data as planned. The data will be discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-review publication.

On July 27, 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that following extensive review of preclinical and clinical data from Phase 1/2 clinical trials, and in consultation with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and other global regulators, the companies selected the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate to move forward into a Phase 2/3 study. BNT162b2 encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein (S), which is the target of virus neutralizing antibodies.

About the Study

The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27, 2020 and has enrolled 43,661 participants to date, 41,135 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 8, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The trial is continuing to enroll and is expected to continue through the final analysis when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS- CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the primary efficacy endpoints evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accruing from 7 days after the second dose, the final analysis now will also include, with the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), new secondary endpoints evaluating efficacy based on cases accruing 14 days after the second dose. The companies believe that the addition of these secondary endpoints will help align data across all COVID-19 vaccine studies and allow for cross-trial learnings and comparisons between these novel vaccine platforms. The companies have posted an updated version of the study protocol at https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus.

Pfizer and BioNTech are continuing to accumulate safety data and currently estimate that a median of two months of safety data following the second (and final) dose of the vaccine candidate – the amount of safety data specified by the FDA in its guidance for potential Emergency Use Authorization – will be available by the third week of November. Additionally, participants will continue to be monitored for long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose. Along with the efficacy data generated from the clinical trial, Pfizer and BioNTech are working to prepare the necessary safety and manufacturing data to submit to the FDA to demonstrate the safety and quality of the vaccine product produced.

Assuming positive data and availability of the necessary safety and manufacturing data, and based on current projections, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. To meet those anticipated quantities and milestones, the companies have produced sufficient supply for their Phase 2/3 clinical trial and have begun to produce and stockpile their pandemic supply.

52336,Sanofi's Supemtek (quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine) Receives the EC's Approval to Prevent Influenza,European Commission approves Supemtek (quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine) for the prevention of influenza in adults aged 18 years and older,"The approval is based on two P-III studies assessing the safety and efficacy of Supemtek (quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine) in 10,000 patients with influenza aged > 18yrs. Supemtek is 1st and only recombinant influenza vaccine approved in the EU
 The P-III efficacy study demonstrated improved protection against influenza compared to standard-dose influenza vaccine and reduced the risk of influenza by an additional 30% in adults aged ≥50yrs.
 Supemtek contains three times more antigen than both egg-based and cell-based standard-dose vaccines. Supemtek is also approved in the US under the tradename Flublok Quadrivalent","First and only recombinant influenza vaccine approved in the European Union
Contains three times more antigen than standard-dose vaccines
Phase 3 efficacy trial demonstrated improved protection against influenza compared to standard-dose influenza vaccine, and reduced the risk of influenza by an additional 30% in adults aged 50 years and older1,2
PARIS – November 18, 2020 – The European Commission has granted a marketing authorization for Supemtek®, a quadrivalent (four-strain) recombinant influenza vaccine, for the prevention of influenza in adults aged 18 years and older. Supemtek is the first and only recombinant influenza vaccine now approved in the European Union.

Supemtek is produced using recombinant technology, which allows an exact match to the key component of the influenza strains recommended by the World Health Organization, avoiding the risk of viral mutations. Supemtek also contains three times more antigen than both egg-based and cell-based standard-dose vaccines. This increased amount of antigen and the use of recombinant technology provide improved protection against influenza, particularly in those aged 50 and older. In comparison with a standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine, Supemtek reduced the risk of influenza by an additional 30% for adults aged 50 years and older1,2.

The authorization is based on clinical data demonstrating safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of Supemtek in two Phase 3 randomized controlled trials1,2 involving more than 10,000 patients in total. Specifically, the relative efficacy of Supemtek was demonstrated in a Phase 3 multicenter (40 outpatient centers in the US, involving more than 9,000 adults), randomized controlled efficacy trial1,2.

“In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing influenza remains a public health priority,” said Thomas Triomphe, Head of Sanofi Pasteur. “Today’s approval of Supemtek supports our strong commitment in advancing influenza vaccine technology. With Supemtek, we provide European health authorities with an additional innovative solution that has demonstrated increased ability to prevent influenza and its potentially severe complications, as well as the burden this causes on healthcare systems.”

Each year, influenza-associated deaths range from 290,000 to 650,0003,4 globally, and the burden on hospitals is around 10 million of influenza-related hospitalizations5. Recent data also show that influenza can multiply the risk of heart attack by up to 10 times, and the risk of stroke by up to 8 times, in the week after influenza infection6 – demonstrating that the burden of influenza goes beyond its well-known respiratory complications.

The first European launches are expected for the 2022/2023 influenza season, with a possibility of accelerating the availability of doses as early as the 2021/2022 season in certain countries. Outside of the EU, Supemtek is also approved in the U.S. under the tradename Flublok Quadrivalent®.

About the recombinant technology

The recombinant technology is a new way of producing influenza vaccines which differs significantly from the two other technologies currently in use (egg-based and cell-based technologies) as it avoids the risk of viral mutations that can lower vaccine efficacy. It ensures the exact match to the key component of the influenza strains recommended by the World Health Organization every year for producing influenza vaccines.

In an independent systematic review7 published in October 2020, the European Center for Disease Prevention notes that “the recombinant haemagglutinin was found to provide a greater protective effect against overall influenza compared with no vaccination and with traditional influenza vaccination … this effect may be attributable to either the restriction of mutations seen with egg-based vaccines or the higher dose of antigen seen in this type of influenza vaccine”.

The recombinant technology is also used for the development of one of Sanofi’s vaccines against COVID-19, developed in partnership with GSK and with the support of US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The Companies announced the start of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for their adjuvanted recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate in September and anticipate first results in December 2020, to support the initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 study before the end of the year. If these data are sufficient for licensure application, Sanofi and GSK plan to request regulatory approval in the first half of 2021.

52345,Pfizer and BioNTech's BNT162b2 Demonstrates 95% Efficacy in Preventing COVID-19,"Pfizer and BioNTech Conclude Phase 3 Study of COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, Meeting All Primary Efficacy Endpoints","The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated that BNT162b2 is 95% effective against COVID-19 beginning 28 days after the first dose. The study evaluated 170 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 162 in PBO group vs 8 in the vaccine group
 The observed efficacy in adults over 65yrs. of age was ~94% and was well tolerated across all populations with ~43,000 participants, no serious safety concerns were observed
 The companies plan to submit the data within days to the FDA for EUA and share data with other regulatory agencies across the globe and expect to produce globally ~50M vaccine doses in 2020 and ~1.3B doses by the end of 2021","November 18, 2020 06:59 AM Eastern Standard Time
NEW YORK & MAINZ, Germany–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced that, after conducting the final efficacy analysis in their ongoing Phase 3 study, their mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, met all of the study’s primary efficacy endpoints. Analysis of the data indicates a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% (p<0.0001) in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and also in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from 7 days after the second dose. The first primary objective analysis is based on 170 cases of COVID-19, as specified in the study protocol, of which 162 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 8 cases in the BNT162b2 group. Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. The observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%.

There were 10 severe cases of COVID-19 observed in the trial, with nine of the cases occurring in the placebo group and one in the BNT162b2 vaccinated group.

To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination.

In addition, the companies announced that the safety milestone required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) has been achieved. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit a request within days to the FDA for an EUA based on the totality of safety and efficacy data collected to date, as well as manufacturing data relating to the quality and consistency of the vaccine. These data also will be submitted to other regulatory agencies around the world.

“The study results mark an important step in this historic eight-month journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end this devastating pandemic. We continue to move at the speed of science to compile all the data collected thus far and share with regulators around the world,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO. “With hundreds of thousands of people around the globe infected every day, we urgently need to get a safe and effective vaccine to the world.”

“We are grateful that the first global trial to reach the final efficacy analysis mark indicates that a high rate of protection against COVID-19 can be achieved very fast after the first 30 µg dose, underscoring the power of BNT162 in providing early protection,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “These achievements highlight the potential of mRNA as a new drug class. Our objective from the very beginning was to design and develop a vaccine that would generate rapid and potent protection against COVID-19 with a benign tolerability profile across all ages. We believe we have achieved this with our vaccine candidate BNT162b2 in all age groups studied so far and look forward to sharing further details with the regulatory authorities. I want to thank all the devoted women and men who contributed to this historically unprecedented achievement. We will continue to work with our partners and governments around the world to prepare for global distribution in 2020 and beyond.”

The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27 and has enrolled 43,661 participants to date, 41,135 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 13, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds, and 41% of global and 45% of U.S. participants are 56-85 years of age. A breakdown of the diversity of clinical trial participants can be found here from approximately 150 clinical trials sites in United States, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina. The trial will continue to collect efficacy and safety data in participants for an additional two years.

Based on current projections, the companies expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. Four of Pfizer’s facilities are part of the manufacturing and supply chain; St. Louis, MO; Andover, MA; and Kalamazoo, MI in the U.S.; and Puurs in Belgium. BioNTech’s German sites will also be leveraged for global supply.

Pfizer is confident in its vast experience, expertise and existing cold-chain infrastructure to distribute the vaccine around the world. The companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled thermal shippers utilizing dry ice to maintain temperature conditions of -70°C±10°C. They can be used be as temporary storage units for 15 days by refilling with dry ice. Each shipper contains a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of each vaccine shipment across their pre-set routes leveraging Pfizer’s broad distribution network.

Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit the efficacy and safety data from the study for peer-review in a scientific journal once analysis of the data is completed.

52352,Pear Therapeutics Launches Somryst Insomnia App Via an End-to-End Virtual Care Experience,PEAR THERAPEUTICS LAUNCHES SOMRYST FOR CHRONIC INSOMNIA VIA AN END-TO-END VIRTUAL CARE EXPERIENCE,"Pear Therapeutics launches Somryst as the first PDT intended for use in the treatment of patients with chronic insomnia aged > 22yrs. It addresses the issues of chronic insomnia by delivering (CBTi) approach that trains the brain and body to sleep
 In a study of ~1,400 adults with CI, PDT reduced the amount of time it took to fall asleep (45%), reduced the amount of time spent awake at night (52%) and reduced severity of insomnia symptoms (45%) with continued improvement at 6 & 12 mos. post-treatment
 Somryst will be promoted via a fully virtual experience, combining telemedicine visits and PDT prescribing and dispensation via PearConnect","Boston and San Francisco, November 17, 2020 – Pear Therapeutics, Inc., today announced the availability of Somryst™, the first prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) intended for use in the treatment of patients 22 years of age and older with chronic insomnia. Somryst addresses the underlying issues of chronic insomnia by delivering cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), an evidence-based approach that trains the brain and body to sleep. Somryst will be promoted via a fully virtual experience, combining telemedicine visit(s) and PDT prescribing and dispensation via PearConnect™.

Somryst is a digital treatment that has been shown to improve the symptoms of chronic insomnia. Over 6 to 9 weeks, depending on a patient’s pace, the program takes them through short lessons and challenges, including algorithm-driven sleep restriction, to train the brain and body to improve their sleep, while also providing clinicians with real-time data on patient progress via physician dashboard. Research shows that PDT use correlates with lasting improvements in sleep outcomes at 12 and 18 months for people suffering from chronic insomnia.2 In clinical studies of more than 1,400 adults with chronic insomnia, the PDT reduced the amount of time it took to fall asleep by 45%, reduced the amount of time spent awake at night by 52% and reduced the severity of insomnia symptoms by 45%, with continued improvement at 6 and 12 months post treatment. Results from clinical studies have been published in JAMA Psychiatry3 and Lancet Psychiatry.4,5

“Despite CBTi being the recommended first line treatment for chronic insomnia, there aren’t enough clinicians who are trained to deliver CBTi therapy. With the availability of Somryst, millions of Americans suffering from chronic insomnia now have access to this treatment,” said Dr. Michelle Primeau, M.D., Medical Director of the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Sleep Medicine Center in San Carlos, CA. “Somryst has been shown to address the underlying issues of chronic insomnia by training the brain and body to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Unlike sleep medications, which may represent short- term solutions and can have unwanted side-effects, Somryst has been shown to deliver long-term results.”

At Somryst.com, individuals will be able to obtain access to a doctor who will perform an evaluation and determine whether or not an individual is a candidate for Somryst. If an individual receives a prescription, a case worker from PearConnect, the industry’s first patient service center for PDTs, will support the individual on how to download Somryst and get started. Telemedicine allows individuals suffering from chronic insomnia to get started on Somryst without leaving their home, important considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 30 million Americans suffer from chronic insomnia1, and cases of chronic insomnia are increasing as Americans continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, a recent survey conducted by Pear Therapeutics of 2,010 adults in the U.S. in October 2020 found that nearly 50% of U.S. adults reported that the pandemic has affected their sleep negatively, with one in four describing their quality of sleep as poor since the pandemic’s start. People with chronic insomnia are more likely to suffer from medical conditions, including chronic pain, hypertension, gastrointestinal problems and heart disease.6 Chronic insomnia can also increase an individual’s chances for developing psychiatric conditions, such as major depression, anxiety, substance use disorder and suicidal thoughts.7

“We’re excited to offer patients who have been struggling to find a long-term solution for chronic insomnia with a meaningful, first-line treatment that is accessible via an end-to-end care model, to support patients and healthcare providers during the virtual onboarding process,” said Corey McCann, President and CEO of Pear Therapeutics. “The availability of Somryst demonstrates our ongoing commitment to developing PDTs to deliver easily-accessible treatment options to patients for their chronic conditions, important now, more than ever as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.”

52360,ViiV's PROgress Study Demonstrates Inclusion of PROs into Clinical Practice Can Improve HIV Care,ViiV Healthcare announces results of the PROgress study demonstrating that the inclusion of patient reported outcomes into clinical practice can improve HIV care,"In the PROgress study, 200 people living with HIV were provided with a pre-visit survey to guide their conversation with their HCP and assess PROs covering a range of measures, including treatment adherence, mental health, substance abuse, and intimate partner violence
 Results: the inclusion of the pre-visit survey made their visit better overall (82%), reminded them of health concerns to raise (81%), and helped them discuss issues that were difficult to speak frankly about (71%).
 The PROgress study program released an implementation toolkit and resources to assist HCPs with the adoption of PROs into their clinical practices","London, 18 November 2020 – ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”), with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, today announced positive initial findings from the PROgress study, which was designed to evaluate how the introduction of patient reported outcomes (PROs) could improve the care of people living with HIV by increasing their healthcare providers’ awareness of their unmet needs. The PROgress study also explored the value of introducing PROs to healthcare providers and clinic staff, and how to best integrate the survey information into routine care.

During the study, conducted over 15 months at two North American community-based HIV outpatient clinics (St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, ON and Midway Specialty Care Clinic, Ft. Pierce, FL), 1761 sessions were conducted in which people living with HIV self-administered a brief electronic tablet survey after arriving for their clinic visit. The survey assessed PROs covering a range of measures, including treatment adherence, mental health, substance abuse, and intimate partner violence. The summary results of the tablet survey were instantly made available to the healthcare provider and used to guide their visit and discussion. Following the pre-visit survey, 200 people living with HIV and 17 healthcare providers and clinic staff were asked to review the process.

The study showed that across all people living with HIV and healthcare providers, 82% agreed that the pre-visit survey of PROs was valuable for HIV clinical practice. People living with HIV found the pre-visit survey improved communication with their healthcare provider by prioritising discussion topics, it also helped initiate discussion on sensitive issues like personal drug use, and improved comprehensiveness of and satisfaction with care. Healthcare providers found the pre-visit survey to be both useful and incorporated into routine care with minimal disruption to clinic flow.

Jean Bacon, Executive Director of the Ontario HIV Treatment Network and Member of the PROgress Study Steering Committee, said: “Incredible improvements in HIV treatment and care have significantly increased the life span of people living with HIV, which has allowed us to expand our focus beyond viral suppression to also examine how we can improve our patients’ wellbeing and quality of life. As shown by the results of the PROgress study, through the incorporation of a simple but focused pre-visit survey, we can look beyond the clinical lab markers of HIV status and can begin to re-define long-term treatment success more holistically to improve care for people living with HIV.”

Perspectives of People Living with HIV from PROgress
To evaluate the perceptions of people living with HIV in the PROgress study, 200 patient participants were surveyed about the usefulness of the pre-visit survey on their HIV care. The perspectives of these participants were positive, with a large proportion (82%) indicating they agreed that the inclusion of the pre-visit survey made their visit better overall. In addition, people living with HIV agreed that the survey helped them consider their overall health (89%), reminded them of health concerns to raise (81%), helped them discuss topics that might not have otherwise arisen (76%), helped them discuss issues difficult to speak frankly about (71%), and helped them in general to decide what to talk about with their healthcare provider (67%).

The survey findings were reinforced by individual one-on-one interviews with 30 patient participants who were able to elaborate further and noted that by being asked about mental health and quality of life-related needs they felt more “cared about.” In the study, people living with HIV reported that the inclusion of their pre-visit survey added value to their care as it improved recall and preparation for areas to address, removed barriers to honest responses, enriched patient-provider communication, promoted self-evaluation in behavioral areas, and improved the comprehensiveness of their care.

Jeff Berry, Member of the PROgress Study Steering Committee, Director of Publications at TPAN, Editor of Positively Aware Magazine, Co-Founder of the Reunion Project and a long-term survivor of HIV said: “The PROgress study has shown how it can be difficult to come to a clinic visit prepared to talk about sensitive issues such as mental health challenges or substance use. Individuals can be afraid or find it very difficult to be open and disclose certain things in person to their healthcare provider, even when they have known them for a long time or if they have a good relationship. Patients have shown how they are much more comfortable and likely to answer some of the more personal questions about their health and wellbeing through a simple survey conducted before a visit, which helps both the individual and their doctor ensure they receive the best care and support.”

Perspectives of Healthcare Providers from PROgress
Similar to people living with HIV, the perspectives of 11 healthcare providers in the PROgress study were evaluated with a post-visit survey and one-on-one interviews that asked them about the usefulness and acceptability of the pre-visit survey. The PROgress study showed that 82% of healthcare providers agreed or strongly agreed that the inclusion of the pre-visit survey added value to the visit overall, made the consultation easier, helped prioritise discussion topics with patients, and led to more discussions on potentially sensitive topics.

Forty-five percent of healthcare providers agreed that the pre-visit survey saved time during their consultation. Furthermore, one-on-one interviews revealed that in instances where the pre-visit survey impacted workflow, healthcare providers noted it was manageable and worth the tradeoff for the ability to better identify issues and increase the comprehensiveness of care. Sentiment from the one-on-one interviews supported this finding, noting that the inclusion of the pre-visit survey allowed them to address sensitive issues that may otherwise have been missed, such as depression and suicidality.

Heidi M. Crane, MD, MPH, PROgress co-Principal Investigator, Professor of Medicine and Associate Director Clinical Cohort and Comorbidity Research Core, Center for AIDS Research, University of Washington, said: “Physicians described how the inclusion of PROs into their practice was like ‘looking behind a curtain’ into some of the more complex and personal issues their patients hadn’t proactively raised before. I’ve personally encountered this in my practice, where a patient who had a prior history of substance usage experienced relapse and didn’t bring up his new challenges during our visits. Then a pre-visit survey picked up on his new relapse and we were able to work together to find him the help and support he needed. Uncovering these personal issues that might have otherwise been missed, perfectly encapsulates how valuable incorporating PROs into clinical practice can be for both people living with HIV and their healthcare providers.”

Implementing patient reported outcomes into clinical practice
In addition to these initial findings, the 15-member PROgress study steering committee of people living with HIV, HIV care providers, clinic directors, and healthcare researchers jointly developed a toolkit and supporting resources to assist healthcare clinics with the adoption of PROs into their clinical practice. This PRO implementation toolkit provides practical advice to support the introduction of pre-visit surveys, including a summary sheet to help both people living with HIV and healthcare providers initiate, structure conversations, and prioritise what is discussed during consultation. Also included in the toolkit is an evidence summary that is designed to raise awareness of the published literature characterising the impact of PROs in routine clinical care for patients with chronic comorbidities. This toolkit and resources are available at https://progresshivcare.org/.

Duncan Short, PhD, Director, Global Implementation Science at ViiV Healthcare, said: “The PROgress study program is important because it confirmed how a short pre-visit survey focused on PROs could improve communication and HIV care, while also providing the foundation for our joint steering committee to develop tools and resources that could support clinics in adopting these measures. This implementation toolkit will provide invaluable information to help integrate PROs into clinical practice and has the potential to improve how people living with HIV receive care and how their healthcare providers deliver it.”

The PROgress study is part of ViiV Healthcare’s pioneering Implementation Science programme, focusing on improving the real-world delivery of HIV treatment and care outside the structured environment of clinical trials. Implementation science trials led by ViiV Healthcare are ongoing globally to study a variety of issues including improving access to testing, clinical care and effective treatment.

52376,Lucira's All-In-One Test Kit Receives the US FDA's EUA as the First COVID-19 Test for Self-Testing at Home,Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes First COVID-19 Test for Self-Testing at Home,"The Lucira’s COVID-19 all-in-one test kit test has been authorized for home use with self-collected nasal swab samples in individuals aged≥ 14yrs. who are suspected of COVID-19 by their HCPs
 It is also authorized for use in POC settings for all ages, but samples must be collected by an HCP when the test is used at the POC to test individuals <14yrs. The test is currently authorized for prescription use only
 Lucira plans to amend its EUA or file a new EUA so people who think they’re infected with COVID-19 can communicate with a medical professional online through a website to arrange a prescription and overnight delivery of the test kit by Q2’21","Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the first COVID-19 diagnostic test for self-testing at home and that provides rapid results. The Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit is a molecular (real-time loop mediated amplification reaction) single use test that is intended to detect the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19.

“The FDA continues to demonstrate its unprecedented speed in response to the pandemic. While COVID-19 diagnostic tests have been authorized for at-home collection, this is the first that can be fully self-administered and provide results at home. This new testing option is an important diagnostic advancement to address the pandemic and reduce the public burden of disease transmission,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Today’s action underscores the FDA’s ongoing commitment to expand access to COVID-19 testing.”

The Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit test has been authorized for home use with self-collected nasal swab samples in individuals age 14 and older who are suspected of COVID-19 by their health care provider. It is also authorized for use in point-of-care (POC) settings (e.g., doctor’s offices, hospitals, urgent care centers and emergency rooms) for all ages but samples must be collected by a healthcare provider when the test is used at the POC to test individuals younger than 14 years old. The test is currently authorized for prescription use only.

The test works by swirling the self-collected sample swab in a vial that is then placed in the test unit. In 30 minutes or less, the results can be read directly from the test unit’s light-up display that shows whether a person is positive or negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Positive results indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Individuals with positive results should self-isolate and seek additional care from their health care provider. Individuals who test negative and experience COVID-like symptoms should follow up with their health care provider as negative results do not preclude an individual from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

“Today’s authorization for a complete at-home test is a significant step toward FDA’s nationwide response to COVID-19. A test that can be fully administered entirely outside of a lab or healthcare setting has always been a major priority for the FDA to address the pandemic. Now, more Americans who may have COVID-19 will be able to take immediate action, based on their results, to protect themselves and those around them,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “We look forward to proactively working with test developers to support the availability of more at-home test options.”

An important component to successful at-home testing is the ability to efficiently track and monitor results. As noted in this EUA, prescribing health care providers are required to report all test results they receive from individuals who use the test to their relevant public health authorities in accordance with local, state and federal requirements. Lucira Health, the test manufacturer, has also developed box labeling, quick reference instructions and health care provider instructions to assist with reporting.

Diagnostic testing remains one of the pillars of our nation’s response to COVID-19. The FDA continues its public health commitment to pursue new approaches that help make critical tests available to more Americans through EUA authority.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

52392,Kala Pharmaceuticals' Eysuvis (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) Receives US FDA's Approval for Dry Eye Disease,Kala Pharmaceuticals Receives FDA Approval of Dry Eye Disease Treatment Eysuvis,"The approval is based on results from four clinical trials, including three P-III trials and one P-II trial, that demonstrated significant improvements in both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease
 The approval has made Eysuvis, the 1st ocular corticosteroid for the treatment of dry eye disease and the 1st drug approved specifically for the short-term (up to 2 wks.) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease
 Eysuvis utilizes Kala’s Ampplify mucus-penetrating particle (MPP) drug delivery technology to enhance penetration of loteprednol etabonate into target tissue on the ocular surface. The company plans to launch Eysuvis in the US by the end of the year 2020","The FDA on Tuesday approved Kala Pharmaceuticals’ Eysuvis (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.25%), making it the first ocular corticosteroid for the treatment of dry eye disease and the first drug approved specifically for the short-term (up to 2 weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.

Kala Pharmaceuticals plans to launch Eysuvis in the United States by year-end.

“The FDA approval of Eysuvis as the first prescription therapy specifically developed to address the short-term treatment needs of people living with dry eye disease is a major accomplishment for Kala and an important moment for patients, who have been waiting for an FDA-approved, safe, effective and fast-acting therapy,” Mark Iwicki, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kala Pharmaceuticals, said in a company news release. “As we prepare to launch Eysuvis, we will leverage our strong foundation of highly experienced ophthalmology marketing, sales and market access professionals with the goal of establishing Eysuvis as the preferred, first-line prescription therapy for dry eye disease. We’d like to thank the many patients and investigators that were involved in the clinical trials that led to this important milestone.”

Approximately 80 percent of people living with dry eye disease suffer from episodic flares. These flares can be caused by a wide variety of triggers and often cannot be adequately managed with current therapies, according to Kala Pharmaceuticals.

Eysuvis utilizes Kala’s Ampplify mucus-penetrating particle (MPP) drug delivery technology to enhance penetration of loteprednol etabonate into target tissue on the ocular surface. Loteprednol etabonate targets the immune responses that drive acute dry eye disease flares. Prior to Eysuvis, there were no FDA-approved ocular corticosteroids for the treatment of dry eye disease.

“The approval of Eysuvis ushers in a new era in the treatment of dry eye disease and offers promise to the millions of dry eye patients who experience acute exacerbations, or flares, of their disease each year,” Edward Holland, MD, Director of Cornea Services at Cincinnati Eye Institute and Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Cincinnati, said in the news release. “For the first time we will be able to offer dry eye patients a therapeutic option that provides rapid relief for both the signs and symptoms of the disease and that is safe and well tolerated.”

The FDA granted approval to Eysuvis based on results from four clinical trials, including three phase 3 trials and one phase 2 trial, that demonstrated significant improvements in both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. Specifically, statistical significance was achieved after 2 weeks of dosing for the sign endpoint of conjunctival hyperemia in all three phase 3 trials. Statistical significance was observed in two of the three phase 3 trials for the symptom endpoints of ocular discomfort severity in both the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) population and in a predefined subgroup of ITT patients with more severe ocular discomfort at baseline. Eysuvis was well-tolerated across the four trials, with adverse events and intraocular pressure increases comparable to that observed with vehicle.

Eysuvis becomes just the fourth FDA approved drug for dry eye disease, joining Restasis (Allergan), Xiidra (Novartis), and Cequa (Sun Pharma).

“Dry eye disease can significantly decrease quality-of-life among affected patients and drive decreased workplace productivity, contact lens intolerance and discontinuation, and poor cataract and refractory surgery outcomes,” said Kelly Nichols, OD, MPH, PhD, FAAO, Dean of the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry. “As the prevalence of dry eye disease increases, there is a tremendous need for new therapies to manage mild-to-moderate dry eye disease patients, many of whom currently go untreated. I am excited by the approval of Eysuvis and confident that having access to an approved corticosteroid specifically for dry eye disease will meaningfully impact the management of patients across the U.S.”",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4.jpg,Regulatory,Kala Pharmaceuticals,Eysuvis,Dry Eye Disease|Regulatory|Etabonate|Ophthalmic|Suspension|Us FDA,publish,27/10/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/kala-pharmaceuticals-receives-fda-approval-of-dry-eye-disease-treatment-eysuvis/,https://pharmashots.com/52392/kala-pharmaceuticals-eysuvis-loteprednol-etabonate-ophthalmic-suspension-receives-us-fdas-approval-for-dry-eye-disease/

52427,Novartis Signs a License Agreement with Mesoblast to Develop and Commercialize Remestemcel-L for ARDS,Novartis secures exclusive rights for potential acute respiratory distress syndrome cell therapy,"Mesoblast to receive $25M up front and $25M as equity investment with additional payments and royalties on achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones
 Novartis to acquire the exclusive WW rights to develop, commercialize & manufacture remestemcel-L for ARDS & access to a cell-therapy based platform with WW rights to a range of potential indications. Novartis has the option to distribute remestemcel-L for GVHD (outside Japan)
 Both parties have rights to co-fund development & commercialization for other non-respiratory indications. Remestemcel-L is currently being studied in COVID-19-related ARDS in an ongoing P-III study while Novartis plans to initiate a P-III study in non-COVID-19-related ARDS","Basel, November 19, 2020 — Novartis announced today that it entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Mesoblast to develop, commercialize and manufacture remestemcel-L for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including that associated with COVID-19. ARDS is an area of significant unmet need, with an approximate 40% mortality rate with current standard of care, which includes prolonged ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation.1,2 As the potential first ARDS therapy, remestemcel-L will use mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a cell-based platform technology, to treat this deadly condition and improve outcomes. Remestemcel-L is currently being studied in COVID-19-related ARDS in an ongoing 300-patient Phase III study.3 Novartis intends to initiate a Phase III study in non-COVID-19-related ARDS after the anticipated closing of the license agreement and successful completion and outcome of the current study.

“We believe that Novartis is uniquely placed to advance this important potential new therapy,” said John Tsai, M.D., Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer for Novartis. “Novartis is committed to, and has demonstrated success with, cell-based therapies and transforming care for a spectrum of respiratory diseases. This makes remestemcel-L an important addition to our pipeline. It has the potential to be the first treatment for the most critically ill ARDS patients, and it provides us with an opportunity to apply years of specialized experience directly to the work of saving lives.”

The demonstrated ability of Novartis to rapidly move from clinical to commercial scale with cell-based therapies will play a role in the successful development and potential commercialization of remestemcel-L, as will the nearly two decades of experience Novartis has in delivering first-in-class products that address areas of unmet respiratory need.

In March, an open label compassionate use program was conducted, which included 12 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, who were being supported with mechanical ventilation. Remestemcel-L treatment was associated with an 83% survival rate.4 Based on those results, remestemcel-L is being studied in this population in an ongoing 300-patient Phase III study, conducted in collaboration with the Cardiothoracic Surgical Network, which is anticipated to be completed in early 2021.3 After the anticipated closing of the license agreement and successful completion and outcome of this ongoing study, Novartis and Mesoblast will work together to develop appropriate critical quality attributes that meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements for remestemcel-L in advance of initiation of the Phase III study in non-COVID-19-related ARDS.

Under the license agreement, Novartis will acquire the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, commercialize and manufacture remestemcel-L for ARDS, and will obtain access to an innovative cell-therapy platform with a range of potential applications in severe respiratory conditions and beyond. Novartis will make a $25 million upfront payment and invest $25 million in Mesoblast equity with additional payments and royalties due on achievement of agreed development, regulatory and commercial milestones. In addition, Novartis will provide certain support to enable commercial manufacturing scale-up. Novartis has the option, if exercised, to distribute remestemcel-L for graft versus host disease (GVHD) (outside Japan). Both parties have rights to co-fund development and commercialization for other non-respiratory indications. The closing of the license agreement is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and certain other conditions.

About remestemcel-L 
Remestemcel-L, is an investigational therapy comprising of culture-expanded mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the bone marrow of an unrelated donor.5 Remestemcel-L is thought to have immunomodulatory properties to counteract the cytokine storms that are implicated in various inflammatory conditions by down-regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increasing production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and enabling recruitment of naturally occurring anti-inflammatory cells to involved tissues.5 In the Phase III study in COVID-19-related ARDS, remestemcel-L is administered as two infusions of 2×106 MSC/kg given three to four days apart.3 The administration of remestemcel-L for the treatment of all-cause ARDS could be the subject of further exploration.

About mesenchymal stromal cells 
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are isolated from bone marrow, adipose tissue and other sources that can be expanded in culture to larger quantities.6 In preclinical studies MSCs have been suggested to transiently accumulate in the pulmonary circulation and have potent immunomodulatory functions.7 They express receptors for multiple chemokine, cytokine and growth factor receptors and in inflammatory conditions secrete immunomodulatory mediators that have broad-acting effects to promote resolution of inflammation and tissue repair.8 MSCs have been infused into well over 1,000 patients, including young children, without serious adverse events to date, testifying to the general safety of this therapeutic approach.9

About acute respiratory distress syndrome 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome that represents a final common pathway for lung injury caused by a variety of factors including bacterial and viral infection (including COVID-19).2 It is characterized by life threatening hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates without evidence of cardiac failure.10 Mortality often exceeds 40%.2 Aside from appropriate ventilator and fluid management, no therapies have been shown to consistently improve survival in randomized clinical trials.8,11

52436,Eli Lilly and Incyte Receive FDA's EUA for Baricitinib + Remdesivir to Treat Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,Baricitinib Receives Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA for the Treatment of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,"The EUA is based on ACCT-2 study assessing baricitinib (4mg, qd for 14 days or until hospital discharge) in combination with remdesivir vs PBO with remdesivir in hospitalized patients with/ out oxygen requirements
 Result: Median time to recovery from 8-7days (12.5% improvement), patients who progressed to ventilation (23% vs 28%), patients who died @day29 (4.7% vs 7.1%) with a relative reduction of 35%; better clinical status @day15
 This marks the second Lilly therapy to be granted a EUA, in addition to neutralizing Ab EUA for high-risk non-hospitalized patients, increasing the number of treatment options for COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease","INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Incyte (NASDAQ: INCY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the distribution and emergency use of baricitinib to be used in combination with remdesivir in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients two years of age or older with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

“Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lilly has been committed to finding potential treatments to help people around the world who’ve been impacted by this virus,” said David A. Ricks, Lilly chairman and CEO. “Today’s FDA action for baricitinib marks the second Lilly therapy to be granted an EUA, in addition to the recent neutralizing antibody EUA for high-risk non-hospitalized patients, increasing the number of treatment options for COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease. This is an important milestone for hospitalized patients on oxygen, as baricitinib may help speed their recovery.”

The FDA grants emergency use authorization to provide availability of a medicine that may help diagnose, treat or prevent a life-threatening disease when no adequate and approved alternatives are available. This use of baricitinib is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use, unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. The authorization is temporary and does not replace the formal review and approval process. In the U.S., baricitinib has not been approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19, and the efficacy, safety and optimal duration of treatment of baricitinib for COVID-19 has not been established. This is the first combination regimen authorized by FDA. Evaluation of baricitinib’s efficacy and safety as a treatment for COVID-19 is ongoing in clinical trials.

Scientific evidence supporting this EUA:
The EUA is based on data from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2), a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in combination with remdesivir versus placebo with remdesivir in hospitalized patients with or without oxygen requirements conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All patients received standard supportive care by the trial site hospital. The recommended dose for this EUA is baricitinib 4-mg once daily for 14 days or until hospital discharge.

Summary of Key Efficacy and Safety Findings

Patients treated with baricitinib in combination with remdesivir had a significant reduction in median time to recovery from 8 to 7 days (12.5% improvement) compared to remdesivir [hazard ratio: 1.15; 95% CI 1.00, 1.31; p=0.047].
Patients treated with baricitinib in combination with remdesivir were more likely to have a better clinical status at Day 15 compared to patients treated with remdesivir [odds ratio: 1.26; 95% CI 1.01, 1.57; p=0.044].
The proportion of patients who progressed to ventilation (non-invasive or invasive) or died by Day 29 was lower in baricitinib in combination with remdesivir (23%) compared to remdesivir (28%) [odds ratio: 0.74; 95% CI 0.56, 0.99; p=0.039].
The proportion of patients who died by Day 29 was 4.7% for baricitinib in combination with remdesivir vs. 7.1% for remdesivir, a relative reduction of 35% [Kaplan Meier estimated difference in Day 29 probability of mortality: -2.6% (95% CI -5.8%, 0.5%)].
Adverse events and serious adverse events were reported in 41% and 15% of patients treated with baricitinib in combination with remdesivir, respectively, vs. 48% and 20% in patients treated with remdesivir. Infections and venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurred in 6% and 4% of patients treated with baricitinib in combination with remdesivir, respectively, vs. 10% and 3% of patients treated with remdesivir. No new safety signals were identified for baricitinib-treated patients.
“The results of ACTT-2 provide physicians and the medical community much-needed insights and randomized placebo-controlled evidence supporting the use of baricitinib in combination with remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19; also importantly, the progression to ventilation or death was significantly reduced with the baricitinib-remdesivir combination,” said Andre Kalil, M.D., professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and a principal investigator of the ACTT studies. “Few treatment options have received an EUA to treat COVID-19 so the authorization of baricitinib is an important step that will give healthcare providers another clinical tool to help patients with advanced disease.”

NIAID and the study investigators expect to have the full analysis published in a peer-reviewed manuscript soon.

Baricitinib, an oral JAK inhibitor discovered by Incyte and licensed to Lilly, is approved and commercially available as OLUMIANT in the U.S. and more than 70 countries as a treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and was recently approved in the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.

“As a company, we have worked quickly and collaboratively to determine the potential utility of our medicines as treatments for COVID-19 and its related complications,” said Hervé Hoppenot, Incyte CEO. “We are pleased that the FDA has authorized the use of baricitinib in combination with remdesivir for COVID-19, and look forward to the opportunity to make more therapies available to patients around the world affected by the global pandemic.”

Access to baricitinib
Under the EUA, inpatient pharmacies in the U.S. may order OLUMIANT (baricitinib) 1-mg and 2-mg tablets through Lilly authorized specialty distributors. A current list of Lilly’s authorized distributors of record for the EUA is available at lillytrade.com. More details about these efforts are available here or by contacting Lilly’s 24-hour support line at 1-855-LillyC19 (1-855-545-5921).

Lilly is working with hospitals, healthcare professionals and governments to facilitate patient access to baricitinib and continues to explore the medicine’s potential use in COVID-19 with other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. With respect to supply, Lilly remains confident in being able to meet the needs of patients under the EUA in the U.S., as well as for existing approved indications around the world.

Important information about baricitinib for COVID-19
This EUA permits the emergency use of baricitinib, in combination with remdesivir, for treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO. Although there is limited safety data, no new safety issues have been identified. Physicians should avoid the use of baricitinib in patients with known active tuberculosis and consider if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks in patients with active serious infections other than COVID-19 or chronic/recurrent infections. Prophylaxis for VTE is recommended unless contraindicated. If clinical features of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism occur, patients should be evaluated promptly and treated appropriately. Evaluate renal, hematologic and hepatic laboratory values at baseline and thereafter, and monitor closely when treating patients with abnormal baseline and post-baseline laboratory values. Avoid use of live vaccines with baricitinib. If a serious hypersensitivity occurs, discontinue baricitinib while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction. Serious venous thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, and serious infections have been observed in COVID-19 patients treated with baricitinib.

For more information about the authorized use of baricitinib in COVID-19 and mandatory requirements of the EUA, please see the FDA Letter of Authorization, Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers and Fact Sheet for Patients, Parents and Caregivers (English) (Spanish). For media resources, including product images and fact sheets, please click here.

There are other ongoing trials with baricitinib in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. In June 2020, Lilly initiated a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib versus background therapy in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. The study includes a diverse patient population from Latin America, the U.S., Europe and Asia. Further information about this Phase 3 trial and other investigator-initiated trials can be accessed here or www.lillytrialguide.com.

Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients

OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS 

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. If positive, start treatment for latent infection prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:

Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT ≥5x upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST ≥10x ULN were observed in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

HYPERSENSITIVITY: Reactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug sensitivity have been observed in patients receiving Olumiant, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue Olumiant while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg and placebo, respectively.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

About OLUMIANT®
OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies, and approved outside of the U.S. for patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs.1 Olumiant is also approved in the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy. There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.2 OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.1

In December 2009, Lilly and Incyte announced an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of baricitinib and certain follow-on compounds for patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

52452,AstraZenca's Imfinzi (durvalumab) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Less-Frequent Fixed-Dose Use,"Imfinzi approved in the US for less-frequent, fixed-dose use","The FDA has approved Imfinzi for an additional dosing option (1500mg, FD, q4w) in the approved indications of unresectable stage III NSCLC after CRT and prior treated advanced bladder cancer
 The approval is based on multiple studies, including the P-III PACIFIC study which supported the 2wks., wt. based dosing in unresectable stage III NSCLC, and the P-III CASPIAN study which used 4wks. FD, during maintenance treatment in ES-SCLC
 The new dosing option for Imfinzi is under regulatory review in multiple countries, including in the EU where the new dosing option was granted accelerated assessment","Four-week dosing now approved in all Imfinzi indications, reducing medical visits and improving patient convenience
AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) has been approved in the US for an additional dosing option, a 1,500mg fixed dose every four weeks, in the approved indications of unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and previously treated advanced bladder cancer. This new option is consistent with the approved Imfinzi dosing in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and will be available to patients weighing more than 30kg as an alternative to the approved weight-based dosing of 10mg/kg every two weeks.

The approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on data from several Imfinzi clinical trials, including the PACIFIC Phase III trial which supported the two-week, weight-based dosing in unresectable Stage III NSCLC, and the CASPIAN Phase III trial which used four-week, fixed-dosing during maintenance treatment in ES-SCLC. The decision follows the Priority Review granted by the FDA in August 2020.

Victoria M. Villaflor, MD, Clinical Professor in the Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutics Research at City of Hope Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California, said: “This new four-week dosing option gives doctors the choice to cut the number of visits for critical cancer treatment in half and offers a regimen that is more convenient for patients. Additionally, it limits potential exposure to infection in the healthcare environment for a population that is especially vulnerable to complications from COVID-19.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “The approval of this new dosing option across indications reflects our ongoing commitment to improve the patient experience and ensure continuity of care – a priority at all times, but especially during the pandemic. Cancer won’t wait, and it is our job to provide patients with treatment options that acknowledge the challenges the pandemic poses to cancer care, enabling them to visit their physician when truly needed and avoid preventable exposure to healthcare-associated infections.”

The four-week 1,500mg fixed-dosing option for Imfinzi is also under regulatory review in several other countries, including in the EU where the new dosing option was granted accelerated assessment.

Imfinzi is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after CRT in the US, in the EU, in Japan, in China and in many other countries, based on the PACIFIC Phase III trial. Imfinzi is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and several other countries. Additionally, it is approved in the US, the EU, Japan and several other countries around the world for the treatment of ES-SCLC based on the CASPIAN Phase III trial.

Stage III NSCLC

Stage III NSCLC (locally advanced) is commonly divided into three sub-categories (IIIA, IIIB and IIIC), defined by how much the cancer has spread locally and the possibility of surgery.1 Stage III disease is different from Stage IV disease, where the cancer has spread (metastasised), as the majority of Stage III patients are currently treated with curative intent.1,2

Stage III NSCLC represents approximately one third of NSCLC incidence and in 2015 was estimated to affect nearly 200,000 patients in the following eight large countries: China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, and the US, with approximately 43,000 cases in the US alone.3,4 The majority of Stage III NSCLC patients are diagnosed with unresectable tumours.5 Prior to approval of Imfinzi in this setting, no new treatments beyond CRT had been available to patients for decades.6-8

Small cell lung cancer

SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly, despite initial response to chemotherapy.9,10 About two thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.11 Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.11

Bladder cancer

In 2018, approximately 550,000 people were diagnosed with bladder cancer around the world and 200,000 died from the disease.12 Locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer remains an area of unmet medical need and typically only one in seven patients is alive five years after diagnosis.13 Urothelial cancer (UC) is the most common form of bladder cancer.14 UC is the 10th most common cancer worldwide and the 13th most common cause of cancer death.12,15 PD-L1 is widely expressed in tumour and immune cells in patients with bladder cancer and helps tumours evade detection from the immune system.16

Imfinzi

Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combinations including with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and other solid tumours.

AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action.

An extensive Immuno-Oncology (IO) development programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation, which represent up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.17 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (POSEIDON and PEARL Phase III trials) and for patients in earlier stages of disease, including potentially-curative settings (MERMAID-1, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC Phase III trials) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy.

Imfinzi is also in development in the Phase II trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline, including Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan).

AstraZeneca’s approach to IO

IO is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes Imfinzi as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

AstraZeneca in oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

By harnessing the power of six scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response, Antibody Drug Conjugates, Epigenetics, and Cell Therapies – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

Authorized for recently diagnosed, mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients

Initial doses will be made available to approximately 300,000 patients, with no medication out-of-pocket costs, under U.S. government allocation program

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., November 21, 2020 – Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the antibody cocktail casirivimab and imdevimab administered together (formerly known as REGN-COV2 or REGEN-COV2), a therapy currently being investigated for use in COVID-19, has received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Casirivimab and imdevimab administered together are authorized for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults, as well as in pediatric patients at least 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg, who have received positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. The clinical evidence from Regeneron’s outpatient trial suggests that monoclonal antibodies such as casirivimab and imdevimab have the greatest benefit when given early after diagnosis and in patients who have not yet mounted their own immune response or who have high viral load.

The criteria for ‘high-risk’ patients are described in the Fact Sheet for Health Care Providers. Casirivimab and imdevimab are not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, or for people currently using chronic oxygen therapy because of an underlying comorbidity who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19.

“This FDA Emergency Use Authorization is an important step in the fight against COVID-19, as high-risk patients in the United States will have access to a promising therapy early in the course of their infection,” said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Regeneron. “The science and technology investments Regeneron has made over three decades positioned us to move rapidly to invent, study and maximize production of our antibody cocktail. Even with these incredible efforts, demand may exceed supply initially, making it even more critical that federal and state governments ensure the casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail is distributed fairly and equitably to the patients most in need. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect to increase available global supply as we continue our collaboration with Roche.”

“The casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail is designed to mimic what a well-functioning immune system does by using very potent antibodies to neutralize the virus,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “Data from approximately 800 non-hospitalized patients showed significant reductions in virus levels within days of receiving the combination, which were associated with significantly fewer medical visits. This benefit was greatest in patients most at risk for poor outcomes due to high viral load, ineffective immune response at baseline or pre-existing risk factors. We are encouraged that no variants resistant to the cocktail were identified in the clinical trial analyses to date, which is consistent with our preclinical findings. We are also very encouraged by recently announced promising vaccine results; however, there remains a need to treat patients who develop COVID-19, especially as some may not have had access to or were not protected by vaccination. Importantly, we continue to advance our rigorous clinical trial program evaluating the safety and efficacy of the antibody cocktail for both the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, and we will share new results as available.”

Production of monoclonal antibodies is a complex, time- and labor-intensive process that requires deep expertise. Utilizing production and manufacturing platforms developed over decades, Regeneron rapidly scaled up production of casirivimab and imdevimab, beginning in the early days of the pandemic with support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Regeneron now expects to have treatment doses ready for approximately 80,000 patients by the end of November, approximately 200,000 patients by the first week of January, and approximately 300,000 patients in total by the end of January 2021.

As part of Operation Warp Speed, in July the U.S. government and Regeneron signed an agreement for this initial supply of the casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail. The U.S. government will coordinate with state authorities to allocate the antibody cocktail on a weekly basis based on the number of COVID-19 cases in each state. The government has committed to providing these 300,000 doses at no cost to patients, although healthcare facilities may charge fees related to administration. Regeneron will immediately begin shipping doses to Amerisource Bergen, a national distributor, which will distribute the therapy as directed by the government.

Under the EUA, the recommended dose is 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab (2,400 mg total) administered as a single intravenous infusion. The authorization is based on positive Phase 2 data announced in September and October from the first 799 adults in an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of non-hospitalized patients (“outpatients”) with COVID-19.

The FDA grants Emergency Use Authorization to medicines that may help diagnose, treat or prevent a life-threatening disease when adequate and approved alternatives are not available. The EUA is temporary and does not take the place of a formal biologics license application (BLA) submission review and approval process. This use is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use, unless terminated or revoked sooner. Casirivimab and imdevimab have not been approved by FDA and remain investigational. Evaluation of its safety and efficacy is ongoing in multiple clinical trials. Data from these trials will be used to support a future BLA submission. Health care providers should review the Fact Sheet for detailed information on the authorized use and requirements of the EUA and may call 844-734-6643 for more information. Please see the Fact Sheet and FDA Letter of Authorization at http://www.RegeneronEUA.com

The casirivimab and imdevimab combination therapy continues to be evaluated in Phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 in certain hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, the Phase 3 open-label RECOVERY trial of hospitalized patients in the UK, and a Phase 3 trial for the prevention of COVID-19 in household contacts of infected individuals. To date, more than 7,000 people have participated in casirivimab and imdevimab clinical trials.

About Regeneron Antibody Cocktail
Casirivimab and imdevimab injection is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies (also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987, respectively) and was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

To develop this novel medicine, Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company’s VelocImmune® mice, which have been genetically modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies identified from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that form the cocktail bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in Science.

The development and manufacturing of the antibody cocktail has been funded in part with federal funds from BARDA under OT number: HHSO100201700020C. Regeneron continues to increase in-house production of casirivimab and imdevimab, and the company has partnered with Roche to increase the global supply beginning in 2021. If the therapy proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted, Regeneron will manufacture and distribute it in the U.S. and Roche will develop, manufacture and distribute it outside the U.S. Once both companies are at full manufacturing capacity in 2021, there are expected to be at least 2 million treatment doses available annually.

About bamlanivimab 
Bamlanivimab is a recombinant, neutralizing human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially treating COVID-19. Bamlanivimab emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628). A Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. A Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987) is also ongoing. In addition, bamlanivimab is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.

About BLAZE-1
BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone or in combination with a second antibody for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than three days prior to drug infusion.

The monotherapy arms of the trial enrolled mild to moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, studying three doses of bamlanivimab (700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg) versus placebo.
The primary outcome measure for the completed arms of the BLAZE-1 trial was change from baseline to day 11 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Additional endpoints include the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through day 29, as well as safety.

The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll over 800 participants.

Data from the monotherapy arms of BLAZE-1 were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

 Result: Reduction in risk of all-cause mortality (43.1%); the median OS (not reached vs 10.4 mos.); reduction in risk of progression (43.5%); m-PFS (4.6 vs 2.8 mos.), results was presented at ESMO 2020
 The improved OS and PFS benefits of the dual regimen were generally consistent across all subgroups and showed an acceptable safety profile with no new safety signals","SAN FRANCISCO and SUZHOU, China, Nov. 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (“Innovent”) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high-quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, announced that the results of the Phase 3 ORIENT-32 study were released in a late-breaking proffered oral presentation at the European Society of Medical Oncology Asia (“ESMO Asia”) Virtual Congress 2020.

ORIENT-32 is the first randomized Phase 3 study reporting the efficacy and safety of an anti-PD-1 antibody-based combination therapy versus sorafenib as the first-line treatment in patients with advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 571 patients were enrolled in the trial. Based on an interim analysis conducted by the study’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) demonstrated significantly improved overall survival (OS) and Independent Radiographic Review Committee (IRRC) progression-free survival (PFS) versus sorafenib. Compared to sorafenib, TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) plus BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) demonstrated a 43.1% decreased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.569, 95%CI: 0.431-0.751, P<0.0001); the median OS was not reached in the TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) plus BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) arm versus 10.4 months in the sorafenib arm. TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) plus BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) also demonstrated 43.5% decreased risk of progression as assessed by IRRC (HR 0.565 95%CI: 0.455-0.701, P<0.0001); median PFS was 4.6 months in the TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) plus BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) arm versus 2.8 months in the sorafenib arm.

The significantly improved OS and PFS benefits brought by TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) plus BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) over sorafenib were generally consistent across all subgroups. The combination regimen showed an acceptable safety profile with no new safety signals. With these results, TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) plus BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) could potentially provide a new option for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced HCC.

Dr. Hui Zhou, Vice President and Head of Oncology Strategy and Medical Sciences of Innovent, stated: “In China, HCC is the fourth most common malignancy with the second highest mortality rate. More than half of new and fatal cases of HCC in the world occur in China every year. Despite the challenges and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the ORIENT-32 study was carried out smoothly and successfully under the joint efforts of all investigators and patients with their families. We are very pleased to see that the ORIENT-32 study demonstrated significant prolongation of OS and PFS in advanced HCC patients in China. With these encouraging results，we will apply to the National Medical Products Administration for the new drug application of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection). We look forward to this potentially becoming a new treatment regimen that could help more patients with HCC to live longer without their disease worsening.”

About ORIENT-32 Trial

ORIENT-32 is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label，multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) compared to sorafenib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma（ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 03794440）. The primary endpoints of the trial are overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by Independent Radiographic Review Committee (IRRC) based on RECIST v1.1.

Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) or sorafenib, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or other reasons stated in the protocol, whichever occurs first.

About Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

Primary liver cancer（PLC）is a common malignancy of the digestive system worldwide, among which about half new cases and deaths occur in China. The main pathological types of liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accounting for 85 to 90 percent, and a small number of cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma（ICC） and HCC-ICC mixed liver cancer. In China, HCC is primarily caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

About TYVYT® (Sintilimab Injection)

TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), an innovative drug with global quality standards jointly developed in China by Innovent and Lilly, has been granted marketing approval by the NMPA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy, and included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies. TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) is the only PD-1 inhibitor included in the new Catalogue of the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL). In April 2020, the NMPA accepted the sNDA for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with ALIMTA® (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy as first-line therapy for the treatment of patients with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In May 2020, TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) monotherapy met the primary endpoint of overall survival in the Phase 2 ORIENT-2 study as second-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In August 2020, the NMPA accepted the sNDA for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with GEMZAR® (gemcitabine for injection) and platinum chemotherapy as first-line therapy in squamous NSCLC. In September 2020, TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) as a first-line treatment in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma met the predefined primary endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival in an interim analysis of the Phase 3 ORIENT-32 study.

TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1 / PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials. This includes global clinical research studies on TYVYT® (sintilimab injection).

About BYVASDA® (Bevacizumab Biosimilar Injection)

BYVASDA® is a bevacizumab biosimilar and a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important factor in angiogenesis that is highly expressed by the endothelial cells in most human tumors. An anti-VEGF antibody binds VEGF selectively with high affinity and blocks its binding to VEGF receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt/PKB and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK. BYVASDA® produces anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the growth, proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, blocking angiogenesis, reducing vascular permeability, blocking blood supply to tumor tissues, inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Since the launch of bevacizumab, it has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab have been well recognized worldwide.

52509,Eiger's Zokinvy (lonafarnib) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Treatment of Progeria and Processing-Deficient PL,Eiger BioPharmaceuticals Announces FDA Approval of Zokinvy™ (lonafarnib): The First Treatment for Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Processing-Deficient Progeroid Laminopathies,"The Progeria Research Foundation and Eiger reported the US FDA’s approval of Zokinvy (lonafarnib) for the treatment of HGPS or progeria and processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies
 Zokinvy reduced the incidence of mortality by 60% & increased the average survival time by 2.5 yrs. Additionally, the FDA has issued an RPD priority review voucher to Eiger
 Eiger plans to sell the PRV and will share the proceeds equally with PRF, under its supply & collaboration agreement. Zokinvy is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that has shown a survival benefit in children with Progeria","PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:EIGR), focused on the development and commercialization of targeted therapies for serious rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ZokinvyTM (lonafarnib) for the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS or Progeria) and processing-deficient Progeroid Laminopathies (PL).

Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies are separate and distinct ultra-rare, genetic, premature aging diseases that accelerate mortality in young patients. Disease manifestations include growth failure, loss of body fat and hair, aged-looking skin, stiffness of joints, hip dislocation, generalized atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke. Untreated children with Progeria die of heart disease at an average age of 14.5 years. There are 20 children and young adults with Progeria and PL identified and followed in the U.S.

Zokinvy is a disease-modifying agent that has demonstrated a statistically significant survival benefit in children and young adults with Progeria. In patients with Progeria, Zokinvy reduced the incidence of mortality by 60% (p=0.0064) and increased average survival time by 2.5 years. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea, nausea), and most were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity. Many Progeria patients have received continuous Zokinvy therapy for more than 10 years.

The increase in survival observed with Zokinvy was derived from two open-label clinical trials (N=62) conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital. The survival analysis compared Zokinvy-treated versus Zokinvy-naïve subjects with Progeria born in or after 1991, by age, gender, and geographic location. Zokinvy-naïve patients originated from a separate natural history study (n=81) conducted by The Progeria Research Foundation.

With this approval, the FDA issued a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to Eiger. The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program is designed to encourage development of new drugs and biologics for the prevention or treatment of rare pediatric diseases. Eiger plans to sell the PRV and under the terms of the Collaboration and Supply Agreement with the Progeria Research Foundation (PRF) will share the proceeds equally with PRF.

“The FDA approval of Zokinvy is the result of a pioneering partnership between Eiger BioPharmaceuticals and PRF to bring the first approved therapy to children, young adults and families living with this devastating disease,” said David Cory, President and CEO of Eiger. “We are very proud that the first drug approval at Eiger confers a survival benefit to patients with one of the most ultra-rare, and ultimately fatal, pediatric diseases. We are extremely grateful to all the children, young adults and their families who have made this possible through participation in the Zokinvy clinical trials.”

“The approval of this breakthrough therapy is a critical milestone for the Progeria community and also for Eiger,” said Thomas Dietz, PhD, Chairman of the Board at Eiger. “The Eiger Board congratulates and commends the management team for their incredible dedication leading the company through its first NDA filing and approval, a major accomplishment for Eiger.”

PRF Medical Director, Leslie Gordon, MD, PhD, added, “Shortly after our son, Sam, was diagnosed with Progeria, my family and I founded The Progeria Research Foundation to find the cause, treatments, and cure for all children with this fatal disease. This first approved medication is a truly incredible milestone for the Progeria community as we forge ahead toward finding the cure. We are thrilled to have Eiger as a partner in bringing Zokinvy to the approval finish line, and for their commitment to ensuring patient access to Zokinvy moving forward.”

In support of the patient and healthcare provider community, Eiger is launching our dedicated service center, Eiger OneCare™. This specialized team will offer personalized support, financial assistance, and access to Zokinvy, all designed for Progeria and processing-deficient Progeroid Laminopathy patients.

Progeria, also known as Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), and Progeroid Laminopathies are separate and distinct ultra-rare, fatal, genetic premature aging diseases that accelerate mortality in young patients.

Progeria is caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene, yielding the farnesylated aberrant protein, progerin. Progeroid Laminopathies are genetic conditions of accelerated aging caused by a constellation of mutations in the LMNA and/or Zmpste24 genes yielding farnesylated proteins that are distinct from progerin. While non–progerin producing, these genetic mutations result in disease manifestations with phenotypes that have overlap with, but are distinct from, Progeria.

Without Zokinvy therapy, children with Progeria die of the same heart disease that affects millions of normally aging adults (arteriosclerosis), but at an average age of 14.5 years. Disease manifestations include severe failure to thrive, scleroderma–like skin, global lipodystrophy, alopecia, joint contractures, skeletal dysplasia, global accelerated atherosclerosis with cardiovascular decline, and debilitating strokes. It is estimated that there are 400 children worldwide with Progeria and 200 children with Progeroid Laminopathies. Of these patients, approximately 180 children and young adults have been identified, including 20 in the U.S. and 23 in Europe.

INDICATION

ZOKINVY is indicated in adult and pediatric patients 12 months of age and older with a body surface area (BSA) of 0.39 m2 and above:

To reduce the risk of mortality in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS)
For the treatment of processing-deficient Progeroid Laminopathies with either:
Heterozygous LMNA mutation with progerin-like protein accumulation
Homozygous or compound heterozygous ZMPSTE24 mutations
LIMITATIONS OF USE

ZOKINVY is not indicated for use in patients with non-HGPS Progeroid Syndromes or with Progeroid Laminopathies known to be processing-proficient. Based upon its mechanism of action, ZOKINVY would not be expected to be effective in these populations.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers
Midazolam
Lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

The most common adverse reactions are vomiting (90%), diarrhea (81%), infection (78%), nausea (56%), decreased appetite (53%), fatigue (51%), upper respiratory tract infection (51%), abdominal pain (48%), musculoskeletal pain (48%), electrolyte abnormalities (43%), headache (37%), decreased weight (37%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (35%), myelosuppression (35%), cough (33%), decreased blood bicarbonate (33%), hypertension (29%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (27%).
GASTROINTESTINAL ADVERSE REACTIONS

Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Of the 57 patients (90%) that experienced vomiting, 30 (53%) patients had mild vomiting, 26 (46%) patients had moderate vomiting, and 1 (2%) patient had severe vomiting.
Of the 35 patients (56%) that experienced nausea, 34 (97%) patients had mild nausea and 1 (3%) patient had moderate nausea.
Of the 51 patients (81%) that experienced diarrhea, the majority of patients (92%) experienced mild or moderate diarrhea; 38 (75%) patients reported mild diarrhea and 9 (18%) patients reported moderate diarrhea. Four (8%) patients reported severe diarrhea.
Loss of fluids and dehydration can be severe, leading to hospitalization. As a result, patients should receive therapy for diarrhea at the earliest signs in order to avoid possible severe complications.
ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE AND ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE ELEVATIONS

Increased alanine aminotransferase was commonly reported (17 [27%] patients). Of the 17 patients with increased alanine aminotransferase, 14 (82%) patients had mild increases, 1 (6%) patient had moderate increases, and 2 (12%) patients had severe increases.
Increased aspartate aminotransferase was also commonly reported (22 [35%] patients). Of the 22 patients with increased aspartate aminotransferase, 21 (95%) patients had mild increases and 1 (5%) patient had a severe increase.
HYPERTENSION

Increases in blood pressure have been documented in patients treated with ZOKINVY. At baseline 22 (35%) patients had either a systolic blood pressure or a diastolic blood pressure or both above the 95th percentile. Over the course of the trials, 18 (29%) patients had hypertension based on systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure measurements above the 95th percentile on 3 or more occasions. Five (8%) patients who were normotensive at baseline had either systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure above the 95th percentile at the end of treatment.
OPHTHALMIC ADVERSE REACTIONS

Lonafarnib caused retinal toxicity in monkeys at 3.7 times the human dose based on plasma drug exposure, but not at 2.1 times the human dose.
LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES

Some patients treated with ZOKINVY developed laboratory abnormalities. These included:

Electrolyte abnormalities (43%), such as hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, or hypercalcemia
Myelosuppression (35%), such as reductions in absolute neutrophil count, white blood cell counts, lymphopenia, hemoglobin, or hematocrit
Increased liver enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase (35%), or alanine aminotransferase (27%)
These laboratory abnormalities often improved while continuing ZOKINVY, but it is not possible to exclude ZOKINVY as a cause of the abnormalities. Periodically monitor electrolytes, complete blood counts, and liver enzymes, and manage abnormalities accordingly.

NEPHROTOXICITY

Lonafarnib caused nephrotoxicity in rats at plasma drug exposures approximately equal to that achieved with the human dose. Monitor renal function at regular intervals during ZOKINVY therapy.
RETINAL TOXICITY

Lonafarnib caused rod-dependent, low-light vision decline in monkeys at plasma drug exposures similar to that achieved with the human dose. Perform ophthalmological evaluation at regular intervals and at the onset of any new visual changes during ZOKINVY therapy.
IMPAIRED FERTILITY

Lonafarnib caused impaired fertility in female rats at 1.2 times the human dose based on plasma drug exposure.
Lonafarnib caused impaired fertility and testicular toxicity in male rats at 1.5 times the human dose based on plasma drug exposure, and toxicity in the male reproductive tract in monkeys at doses lower than the human dose based on plasma drug exposure.

52523,AstraZeneca's AZD1222 Meets its Primary Endpoint in Preventing COVID-19,AZD1222 vaccine met primary efficacy endpoint in preventing COVID-19,"Interim analysis results of COV002 & COV003 study of AZD1222 in the UK & Brazil showed the vaccine is effective in preventing COVID-19 and no hospitalizations/ severe cases of the disease were reported
 One dosing regimen showed an efficacy of 90% when AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose of at least 1 mos. apart & another dosing regimen showed 62% efficacy when given as 2 full doses at least 1 mos. apart. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in the efficacy of ~70%
 AZ will plan regulatory submission of the data across the globe and will seek an Emergency Use Listing from the WHO for an accelerated pathway to vaccine availability in low-income countries","23 November 2020 07:00 GMT
Two different dosing regimens demonstrated efficacy with one showing a better profile
No hospitalisations or severe cases of COVID-19 in participants treated with AZD1222
Positive high-level results from an interim analysis of clinical trials of AZD1222 in the UK and Brazil showed the vaccine was highly effective in preventing COVID-19, the primary endpoint, and no hospitalisations or severe cases of the disease were reported in participants receiving the vaccine. There were a total of 131 COVID-19 cases in the interim analysis.

One dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy of 90% when AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart, and another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted in an average efficacy of 70%. All results were statistically significant (p<=0.0001). More data will continue to accumulate and additional analysis will be conducted, refining the efficacy reading and establishing the duration of protection.

An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board determined that the analysis met its primary endpoint showing protection from COVID-19 occurring 14 days or more after receiving two doses of the vaccine. No serious safety events related to the vaccine have been confirmed. AZD1222 was well tolerated across both dosing regimens.

AstraZeneca will now immediately prepare regulatory submission of the data to authorities around the world that have a framework in place for conditional or early approval. The Company will seek an Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization for an accelerated pathway to vaccine availability in low-income countries. In parallel, the full analysis of the interim results is being submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Professor Andrew Pollard, Chief Investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford, said: “These findings show that we have an effective vaccine that will save many lives. Excitingly, we’ve found that one of our dosing regimens may be around 90% effective and if this dosing regime is used, more people could be vaccinated with planned vaccine supply. Today’s announcement is only possible thanks to the many volunteers in our trial, and the hard working and talented team of researchers based around the world.”

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “Today marks an important milestone in our fight against the pandemic. This vaccine’s efficacy and safety confirm that it will be highly effective against COVID-19 and will have an immediate impact on this public health emergency. Furthermore, the vaccine’s simple supply chain and our no-profit pledge and commitment to broad, equitable and timely access means it will be affordable and globally available, supplying hundreds of millions of doses on approval.”

The pooled analysis included data from the COV002 Phase II/III trial in the UK and COV003 Phase III trial in Brazil. Over 23,000 participants are being assessed following two doses of either a half-dose/full-dose regimen or a regimen of two full doses of AZD1222 or a comparator, meningococcal conjugate vaccine called MenACWY or saline. The global trials are evaluating participants aged 18 years or over from diverse racial and geographic groups who are healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions.

Clinical trials are also being conducted in the US, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Kenya and Latin America with planned trials in other European and Asian countries. In total, the Company expects to enrol up to 60,000 participants globally.

The Company is making rapid progress in manufacturing with a capacity of up to 3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 on a rolling basis, pending regulatory approval. The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius/ 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered within existing healthcare settings.

AstraZeneca continues to engage with governments, multilateral organisations and collaborators around the world to ensure broad and equitable access to the vaccine at no profit for the duration of the pandemic.

COV002

COV002 is a single-blinded, multi-centre, randomised, controlled Phase II/III trial assessing the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of AZD1222 in 12,390 participants in the UK. Trial participants to date are aged 18 years or over, who are healthy or have medically stable chronic diseases and are at increased risk for being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Participants receive one or two intramuscular doses of a half dose (~2.5 x1010 viral particles) or full dose (~5×1010 viral particles) of AZD1222 or comparator, meningococcal vaccine MenACWY. Participants have blood samples drawn and clinical assessments for safety as well as immunogenicity at multiple timepoints up to one year post-vaccination. Suspected cases presenting with compatible symptoms were tested for virological confirmation by COVID-19 PCR. In addition, weekly swabbing are done for detection of infection and assessment of vaccine efficacy against infection.

COV003

COV003 is a single-blinded, multi-centre, randomised, controlled Phase III trial assessing the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of AZD1222 in 10,300 participants in Brazil. Trial participants to date are aged 18 years or over, who are healthy or have medically stable chronic diseases and are at increased risk for being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Participants are randomised to receive two intramuscular doses of a full dose (~5×1010 viral particles) of AZD1222 or comparator, meningococcal vaccine MenACWY as first dose and a saline placebo as second dose. Participants have blood samples drawn and clinical assessments for safety as well as immunogenicity at multiple timepoints up to one year post-vaccination. Suspected cases presenting with compatible symptoms were tested for virological confirmation by COVID-19 PCR.

AZD1222
AZD1222 was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

52548,Merck to Acquire OncoImmune for $425M,Merck to Acquire OncoImmune,"Merck to acquire all outstanding shares of Oncolmmune for $425 M in cash as an upfront. Additionally, Oncolmmune will receive sales-based and contingent payments on the achievement of the regulatory milestones
 The acquisition will give Merck control of CD24Fc which showed improvement in an interim efficacy analysis of a P-III study for the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID-19. The acquisition is expected to be closed by the end of 2020
 Prior to the completion of the acquisition, OncoImmune will spin-out certain rights and assets unrelated to the CD24Fc program to a new entity owned by the existing shareholders. Merck will invest $50M in the new entity","KENILWORTH, N.J., & ROCKVILLE, Md.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and OncoImmune, a privately-held, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all outstanding shares of OncoImmune for an upfront payment of $425 million in cash. In addition, OncoImmune shareholders will be eligible to receive sales-based payments and payments contingent on the successful achievement of certain regulatory milestones. OncoImmune recently announced positive top-line findings from an interim efficacy analysis of a Phase 3 study evaluating its lead therapeutic candidate CD24Fc for the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID-19.

“Meaningful new therapeutic options are desperately needed for possibly millions of people around the world who will develop severe or critical COVID-19 disease,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, President Merck Research Laboratories. “Recent clinical investigations support the view that CD24Fc may provide benefit beyond standard of care therapy for COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen support, and hence will represent an important addition to the Merck pipeline of investigational medicines and vaccines designed to address the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Interim analysis of data from 203 participants (75% of the planned enrollment) reported by OncoImmune indicated that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 treated with a single dose of CD24Fc showed a 60% higher probability of improvement in clinical status, as defined by the protocol, compared to placebo. The risk of death or respiratory failure was reduced by more than 50%. Detailed results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

“Outstanding work by the OncoImmune team has provided compelling evidence regarding the use of CD24Fc in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 in our Phase 3 Trial,” said Yang Liu, PhD, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of OncoImmune. “We look forward to working with the scientists and manufacturing engineers at Merck as well as regulators as we seek to accelerate the global development of this potentially important therapy.”

Under the agreement, prior to the completion of the acquisition, OncoImmune will spin-out certain rights and assets unrelated to the CD24Fc program to a new entity to be owned by the existing shareholders of OncoImmune.

Homechoice Claria with Sharesource will be available in the US in the coming weeks","DEERFIELD, Ill. – November 23, 2020

Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), a global innovator in renal care, today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the Homechoice Claria automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) system with Sharesource connectivity platform. Homechoice Claria combines a simple user interface with the benefits of Sharesource, the only two-way remote patient management platform for patients on peritoneal dialysis in the U.S. Homechoice Claria is cleared for both adult and pediatric populations.1 The clearance follows the recent finalization of the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Treatment Choices (ETC) payment model, which aims to significantly increase the number of new patients with kidney failure who receive home dialysis and/or organ transplants.

“Our goal remains to expand accessibility to home-based therapy for U.S. patients with kidney failure,” said Gavin Campbell, general manager of Baxter’s U.S. Renal Care business. “Homechoice Claria with Sharesource will support accelerated home dialysis growth by bringing the benefits of a two-way connected automated peritoneal dialysis system combined with a simple, intuitive device to more patients in the U.S.”

Enabling Enhanced Care with Remote Patient Management
With one in four APD patients globally benefitting from Baxter’s two-way remote patient management technology, Sharesource offers patients and clinicians the ability to stay closely connected to proactively address key aspects of peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy. Through the platform’s accurate, daily treatment data and analytics, clinicians can manage patients remotely and make timely therapy decisions while keeping patients safely at home. Clinicians using Homechoice Claria with Sharesource also have greater visibility to patient adherence patterns, which may allow for early intervention and an increased focus on proactive care.2 To date, more than 6 million home dialysis treatments completed in the U.S. have been enabled by Sharesource, with over 20 million PD treatments managed around the world.

Homechoice Claria offers enhanced features that facilitate added convenience for patients and clinical teams, as well as best-in-class educational companions to further simplify the PD experience. For patients, intuitive control buttons and an easy-to-read screen complement straightforward instructions in 38 languages. To extend patients’ learning beyond the clinic, MyClaria – a web-based app included as part of the Homechoice Claria system – features step-by-step, voice activated and enabled instructions to guide patients through therapy. For clinicians, MySharesource – also a web-based app – is a resource featuring step-by-step guidance and quick demo videos on how to use the Sharesource platform.

“When starting their patients on PD, clinicians are looking for ways to help manage their changing needs over time,” said Amy O’Brien, PD clinical specialist at Baxter. “The combination of features, insights and resources available through Homechoice Claria with Sharesource creates an accurate, efficient tool for therapy management, resulting in peace of mind for patients and the healthcare providers who support them.”

Adding Homechoice Claria to its APD cycler portfolio enhances Baxter’s efforts to bring the benefits of Sharesource remote patient management to as many clinics and patients as possible in the U.S. Baxter will continue offering its Sharesource-enabled APD cycler, Amia, which offers additional features to support patients, including a touchscreen user interface and built-in voice guidance. The introduction of Homechoice Claria follows several Baxter initiatives across the continuum of care to improve options for patients with kidney failure, including:

Launching CKD&Me, an app providing customized disease and therapy education for the individual learning needs of patients with chronic kidney disease.
Developing the PD Excellence Academy, a first-of-its-kind curriculum providing education to PD nurses in one easily-accessible online resource.
Homechoice Claria with Sharesource will be available in the U.S. in the coming weeks. More information is available at Claria.Baxter.com.

52595,Roche's Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Post-Exposure Prevention of Influenza,Roche announces FDA approval of Xofluza for the prevention of influenza following contact with an infected person,"The approval is based on P-III BLOCKSTONE study assessing a single dose of Xofluza vs PBO in household members who were living with someone with influenza confirmed by a rapid influenza diagnostic test
 Results: The proportion of household members aged ≥12yrs. who developed influenza (1% vs 13%), well-tolerated with no new safety signals
 Xofluza is the first single-dose influenza medicine approved to prevent influenza for those who have had contact with an infected person. Roche also plans to file sNDA for Xofluza as a treatment for acute uncomplicated influenza in pediatric patients (1-12yrs.) and for the prevention of influenza in the same age group who have been exposed to influenza","Basel, 24 November 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil) as a treatment to prevent influenza in people 12 years of age and older following contact with someone with influenza (known as post-exposure prophylaxis). Xofluza is the first single-dose influenza medicine approved for post-exposure prophylaxis.

“With today’s approval, Xofluza is now available as the first single-dose, post-exposure preventive treatment for influenza,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We’re hopeful that reducing the burden of influenza may help to mitigate the strain on our healthcare system amid the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Post-exposure prophylaxis with single-dose Xofluza was evaluated in the phase III BLOCKSTONE study, which was recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.1 BLOCKSTONE evaluated Xofluza compared with placebo as a preventive treatment for household members (adults and children) who were living with someone with influenza. Xofluza showed a statistically significant prophylactic effect on influenza after a single oral dose in people exposed to an infected household contact. The proportion of household members 12 years of age and older who developed influenza was 1% in participants treated with Xofluza and 13% in the placebo-treated group. Xofluza was well tolerated in this study and no new safety signals were identified.

“The flu is a serious illness that burdens households and sickens millions across the US every year,” said Serese Marotta, Chief Operating Officer at Families Fighting Flu. “As we are about to enter a flu season within a global COVID-19 pandemic, we welcome Xofluza as a single-dose flu medicine to be used preventively after exposure to flu.”

The most frequently reported adverse events (occurring in at least 1% of adult and adolescent influenza patients treated with Xofluza) included diarrhoea (3%), bronchitis (3%), nausea (2%), sinusitis (2%), and headache (1%).

Additionally, Roche is determining a path forward with the FDA for a potential indication for Xofluza as a treatment for acute uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy children (one to 12 years of age) and for the prevention of influenza in the same age group who have been exposed to influenza. Xofluza is currently not approved for use in this population.

Xofluza is already FDA-approved to treat acute uncomplicated influenza in people 12 years of age and older who have had influenza symptoms for no more than 48 hours and who are otherwise healthy or at high risk of developing influenza-related complications.2 Although some of the symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza can look similar, the two illnesses are caused by completely different viruses. Xofluza is specifically designed to treat influenza viruses only and is not effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19.3

About BLOCKSTONE 1, 3
BLOCKSTONE is a phase III, double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, post-exposure prophylaxis study that evaluated a single dose of Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil) compared with placebo in household members (adults and children) who were living with someone with influenza confirmed by a rapid influenza diagnostic test (the ‘index patient’). The study was conducted by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. in Japan during the 2018-2019 influenza season.

Those diagnosed with influenza were required to have onset of symptoms for less than 48 hours and participants were required to have lived with those diagnosed for more than 48 hours. The participants were randomised to receive a single dose of Xofluza (dose according to body weight) or placebo as a preventive measure against developing influenza.

Xofluza showed a statistically significant prophylactic effect on influenza after a single oral dose in people exposed to an infected household contact. The proportion of household members 12 years of age and older who developed influenza was 1% in participants treated with Xofluza and 13% in the placebo-treated group. Xofluza was well tolerated in this study and no new safety signals were identified.

About Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil)
Xofluza is a first-in-class, single-dose oral medicine with an innovative proposed mechanism of action that has demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of influenza viruses, including in vitro activity against oseltamivir-resistant strains and avian strains (H7N9, H5N1) in non-clinical studies.4 Xofluza is the first in a class of antivirals designed to inhibit the cap-dependent endonuclease protein, which is essential for viral replication.4, 5

Xofluza is available in the US and in several other countries for the treatment of influenza types A and B. In the US, Xofluza is approved for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza in people 12 years of age and older who are otherwise healthy or at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza, and who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. Xofluza is also approved for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in people 12 years of age and older following contact with an individual who has influenza. Xofluza was the first new antiviral to be approved by the FDA in 20 years.

Robust clinical evidence has demonstrated the benefit of Xofluza in several populations (otherwise-healthy, high-risk and post-exposure prophylaxis). Xofluza is being further studied in a phase III development program, including children under the age of one (NCT03653364) as well as to assess the potential to reduce transmission of influenza from an infected person to healthy people (NCT03969212). 6, 7

Xofluza was discovered by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and is being further developed and commercialised globally in collaboration with the Roche Group (which includes Genentech in the US) and Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Under the terms of this agreement, Roche holds worldwide rights to Xofluza excluding Japan and Taiwan, which will be retained exclusively by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

About Roche in Influenza
Influenza is one of the most common, yet serious, infectious diseases, representing a significant threat to public health.

52600,Targovax Reports Results of ONCOS-102 in P-l/ll Study as 1L and 2L Treatment for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,Targovax demonstrates encouraging survival data for ONCOS-102 in mesothelioma,"The exploratory P-l/ll study involves the assessment of ONCOS-102 + SoC CT (pemetrexed/cisplatin) as a 1L and 2L treatment in 31 patients with MPM
 Result: @18mos. follow up showed that mOS (18.2mos. vs 14.2mos.) and showed broad and powerful immune activation, associated with better survival outcome. The next survival analysis is planned in H1’21
 Targovax and Merck are currently reviewing the next steps for combining ONCOS-102 and Keytruda in MPM","OSLO, Norway, Nov. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Targovax ASA (OSE: TRVX), a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing oncolytic viruses to target hard-to-treat solid tumors, today releases 18-month follow-up data from the randomized phase I/II trial of ONCOS-102 in combination with standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).

The study is an open-label, exploratory phase I/II trial adding ONCOS-102 to SoC chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin) in first- and second- (and later) line treatment of MPM to assess safety, immune activation and efficacy versus SoC only. In total, 31 patients have been included in the trial, with 20 patients in the experimental group receiving the ONCOS-102 and SoC combination (8 randomized in first-line), and 11 patients in the control group receiving SoC only (6 in first-line).

At the 18-month follow-up, more than half of the patients in the first-line ONCOS-102-treated group were still alive, and the mOS was not yet reached. Based on current survival data the mOS will be 18.2 months or longer. For the first-line SoC-only control group, less than half of the patients were alive, and mOS will be 14.2 months or less, which is similar to outcomes from previously reported trials where patients received the same chemotherapy treatment1. An analysis of all the first-line patients, including 3 experimental safety lead-in patients, shows similar results as the randomized first-line patients. The next survival analysis is planned in first half of 2021.

In June, it was reported that ONCOS-102 treatment induces broad and powerful immune activation in MPM, far beyond what is achieved with SoC alone. Importantly, this immune activation is associated with better survival outcomes at the 18-month analysis, indicating that the immunological activity of ONCOS-102 drives the observed clinical benefit.

The powerful immune activation generated by ONCOS-102 builds a strong rationale for combining ONCOS-102 with a checkpoint inhibitor in MPM. This combination could provide further clinical benefits in this indication. Targovax and Merck (known as MSD outside of the USA) are currently reviewing next steps for combining ONCOS-102 and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in MPM. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab (Yervoy and Opdivo) for the first-line treatment of MPM based on mOS of 18.1 months (Baas 2020), and this is expected to serve as a benchmark for further approvals.

Magnus Jäderberg, Chief Medical Officer of Targovax, said: “We are very pleased that overall survival in first-line patients, is tracking well in the ONCOS-102 treated group. We have already established in the current study that ONCOS-102 drives favorable remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, and we are now starting to see this immune activation translating into the encouraging improved survival outcomes in these 18-month results. This is exactly what we had hoped to see and prepares the way for combining ONCOS-102 with checkpoint inhibition. The immune data suggest to us that survival outcomes in combination with Keytruda may be further improved from the results reported today.”

The first results from the trial were announced in January 2020 (see press release here), while immunological data and 12-month survival rate were reported in June 2020 (see press release here) and presented at the SITC annual meeting in November 2020 (see poster here).

Transaction will almost double Selvita’s revenues
Enterprise value of € 31.2M to be paid in cash
Fidelta to continue performing drug discovery services for Galapagos for the next five years
Mechelen, Belgium and Krakow, Poland – 23 November 2020, 22.15 CET – Galapagos NV [Euronext & NASDAQ: GLPG] and Selvita S.A. [WSE: SLV] – announced today that they have signed an agreement under which Selvita will acquire 100% of the outstanding shares in Fidelta d.o.o. for an enterprise value of € 31.2M plus the customary adjustments for net cash and working capital.

Fidelta is a contract research organization within the Galapagos Group of companies, with core scientific competences in inflammation, fibrosis, and anti-infectives. It currently employs 181 employees, including over 150 highly experienced scientists, providing integrated drug discovery services in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry, with a proven track record of accomplished laboratory projects over many years. Fidelta is located in state-of-the art R&D facilities in Zagreb, Croatia which offer almost 6,000 m2 of research space. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close on the 4th of January 2021.

Galapagos is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with a deep pipeline of novel mechanism of action candidates and commercial operations in Europe; as such, the CRO activities offered by Fidelta no longer fit with its strategy.

Upon completion of the acquisition, Fidelta will be fully consolidated under the Selvita Group, and will continue to operate under the Fidelta name.

More comprehensive offering and opening of new growth opportunities

The scope of services provided by Fidelta is complementary to Selvita’s offerings and will enable Selvita to build a competitive advantage in business areas such as DMPK, in vivo pharmacology, and toxicology. Selvita will also increase its scale of operations within medicinal chemistry and in vitro pharmacology, resulting in significant strengthening of its market position.

Fidelta’s therapeutic areas of expertise align with current market trends, as infectious diseases, inflammation, and fibrosis are all areas of core expertise for Fidelta and are becoming increasingly major areas of interest for pharma companies due to the significant and unmet medical needs.

“We are thrilled to announce our acquisition of Fidelta. This is a perfect fit for us: an extensively experienced organization, with a full range of in-house drug discovery capabilities and an established track record of clinical candidate delivery,” says Boguslaw Sieczkowski, Chief Executive Officer at Selvita. “With this acquisition, we are not only executing our strategy announced this year, but we’re actually taking a leap in both the scope of our services portfolio and the scale of business. It is a transformative moment in the history of Selvita.”

“The scientific knowledge, the business acumen, and the focus and commitment of the team at Fidelta are second to none. I would like to thank the Fidelta team for the excellent collaboration over the years. I’m sure they will thrive under the Selvita umbrella. We will continue part of our discovery work with Fidelta, so we will benefit from that,” says Onno van de Stolpe, CEO of Galapagos.

“We are very happy to take this big and logical step in the further development of Fidelta, and together with Selvita, to strengthen our presence on the market. Bringing together these two companies will allow us to keep a high level of quality and offer an even more integrated approach in services that we provide to our clients,” says Adrijana Vinter, Managing Director of Fidelta.

Transaction structure and its value potential

Over the years, Fidelta has transformed from an internal R&D department into a profitable external CRO delivering strong growth. Fidelta reported revenues of € 17.4M and an EBITDA of € 2.6M in 2019. Full year 2020 is on track to become a record year for Fidelta; in the first 9 months Fidelta reported revenues of € 17.2M, and an operating profit of € 4.4M.

Fidelta possesses a diverse revenue base, including cooperation with a significant number of big pharma and biotech customers. The acquisition will add to Selvita’s revenues growth and make a significant contribution to its EBITDA.

 Results: reduction in risk of death (23%); m-OS (10.9 vs 8.4 mos.); @12 & 18-mos. OS rates (47% & 31% vs 34% & 21%); ORR (19% and 22%); DoR (6.9 vs 3.9 mos.)
 Opdivo is a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, designed to harness the body’s immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response and is the first immunotherapy to be approved for gastroesophageal cancer in the EU","PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Opdivo (nivolumab) for the treatment of adults with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) after prior fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based combination chemotherapy.

The EC’s decision is based on results from the Phase 3 ATTRACTION-3 trial, a study sponsored by Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. of Japan, which demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) in patients who received Opdivo versus chemotherapy. The safety profile for Opdivo was favorable compared with chemotherapy and consistent with previously reported studies of Opdivo in other solid tumors.

“Today’s approval marks a critically important milestone for those living with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, as this is the first time an immunotherapy treatment option has been approved in the European Union for this patient population,” said Ian M. Waxman, M.D., development lead, gastrointestinal cancers, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We are proud of our work in advancing treatment options for people living with upper gastrointestinal cancers, and we look forward to working with European stakeholders to bring Opdivo to more eligible patients who may benefit.”

In addition to this approval in the EU, Opdivo has been approved in five countries, including the United States and Japan, for the second-line treatment of patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic ESCC. Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the ATTRACTION-3 clinical trial for their important contributions.

ATTRACTION-3 Efficacy and Safety Results

In the Phase 3 ATTRACTION-3 trial, which had a primary endpoint of OS:

Opdivo reduced risk of death by 23%, compared to chemotherapy alone [Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.77; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.62 to 0.96; p=0.019].
Median OS with Opdivo was 10.9 months (95% CI: 9.2 to 13.3) compared to 8.4 months (95% CI: 7.2 to 9.9) with chemotherapy alone, demonstrating a 2.5-month improvement.
The Opdivo arm showed 12- and 18-month OS rates of 47% (95% CI: 40 to 54) and 31% (95% CI: 24 to 37), respectively, versus 34% (95% CI: 28 to 41) and 21% (95% CI: 15 to 27) among patients in the chemotherapy arm. Survival benefit with Opdivowas observed regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression levels.
Objective response rates (ORR) between the Opdivo and chemotherapy arms were comparable at 19% (95% CI: 14 to 26) and 22% (95% CI: 15 to 29), respectively.
Median duration of response (DoR) for patients was substantially increased in the Opdivo arm at 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.4 to 11.1) versus 3.9 months (95% CI: 2.8 to 4.2) in the chemotherapy arm.
An exploratory analysis of patient-reported outcomes showed significant overall improvement in quality of life with Opdivo versus chemotherapy. Fewer treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported with Opdivo versus chemotherapy, with a rate of 66% for any grade TRAEs in patients receiving Opdivo compared to 95% for those patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients in the Opdivo arm also experienced a lower incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TRAEs compared to those in the chemotherapy arm (18% versus 63%), and the percentage of patients experiencing TRAEs leading to discontinuation was the same in both arms (9%).
About ATTRACTION-3

ATTRACTION-3 (ONO-4538-24/CA209-473; NCT02569242) is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, open-label global study, evaluating Opdivo versus chemotherapy (docetaxel or paclitaxel) for patients with esophageal cancer refractory or intolerant to first-line combination therapy with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based drugs. Patient enrollment occurred predominantly in Asia, with the remainder in the United States and Europe. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate, duration of response and safety.

About Esophageal Cancer

Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common cancer and the sixth most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. The five-year relative survival rate is 10% or less for patients diagnosed with metastatic disease. Each year, 53,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed in Europe. The two most common types of esophageal cancer are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, the latter accounting for approximately 60% of all esophageal cancer cases diagnosed in Europe. The majority of cases are diagnosed in the advanced setting and impact a patient’s daily life, including their ability to eat and drink.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 10% (5/49) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). In NSCLC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%). Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.7%) and Grade 2 (1%).

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received OPDIVO monotherapy or OPDIVO in combination with YERVOY or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: cardiac/vascular: myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; nervous system: meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; ocular: uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; musculoskeletal and connective tissue: myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; endocrine: hypoparathyroidism; other (hematologic/immune): hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.

In addition to the immune-mediated adverse reactions listed above, across clinical trials of YERVOY monotherapy or in combination with OPDIVO, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1% of patients unless otherwise specified: nervous system: autoimmune neuropathy (2%), myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, motor dysfunction; cardiovascular: angiopathy, temporal arteritis; ocular: blepharitis, episcleritis, orbital myositis, scleritis; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis (1.3%); other (hematologic/immune): conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, hypersensitivity vasculitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis.

Some ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada–like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.

Infusion-Related Reactions

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients. In MPM patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients.

In separate Phase 3 trials of YERVOY 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.9% (28/982) of patients.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO or YERVOY. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.

Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.

Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone

In randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.

Lactation

There are no data on the presence of OPDIVO or YERVOY in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose.

 In ILLUMINATE-B, Oxlumo demonstrated a 72% mean reduction in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio from baseline to 6mos., reduction of oxalate as consistent across all three body wt. categories. Additionally, therapy demonstrated positive results across 2EPs, including additional measures of oxalate","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved OXLUMO™ (lumasiran) injection for subcutaneous use, the first-ever therapy available for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) to lower urinary oxalate levels in pediatric and adult patients. PH1 is an ultra-rare genetic disease characterized by oxalate overproduction. The excess production of oxalate results in the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract and can lead to the formation of painful and recurrent kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, progression to kidney failure, and systemic organ dysfunction. In ILLUMINATE-A – the largest controlled Phase 3 study ever conducted in PH1 – OXLUMO was shown to significantly reduce levels of urinary oxalate relative to placebo, with the majority of patients achieving normal1 or near-normal2 levels. OXLUMO demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile, with injection site reactions (ISRs) as the most common drug-related adverse reaction. In the ILLUMINATE-B pediatric Phase 3 study, the safety and efficacy of OXLUMO were demonstrated in patients under the age of six, and results showed reduction of urinary oxalate and an overall safety and tolerability profile consistent with that demonstrated in ILLUMINATE-A.

“The approval of OXLUMO is a further testament to the impact RNAi therapeutics can have in transforming the treatment of severe, life-threatening diseases like PH1. Results from the ILLUMINATE-A and ILLUMINATE-B studies demonstrate that OXLUMO addresses the underlying pathophysiology of PH1 in adults, children and infants, and we believe this newly approved medicine has the potential to change the course of this progressive disease,” said Akshay Vaishnaw, M.D., Ph.D., President of R&D at Alnylam. “OXLUMO marks our third FDA approval in less than three years, positioning us to meet or exceed our Alnylam 2020 strategy and goals, and further highlighting the productivity of our RNAi platform and the speed at which we can bring innovative medicines to patients. For patients and families impacted by PH1, this is an historic moment, as OXLUMO represents the first, targeted therapeutic option available to them. We are grateful to all the investigators, staff and patients who participated in the ILLUMINATE clinical studies, and to their families, caregivers and patient advocates. This moment is what we all had hoped for.”

The FDA approval of OXLUMO was primarily based on positive results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ILLUMINATE-A Phase 3 study, with results presented in June 2020 at the 57th European Renal Association – European Dialysis and Transplant Association Virtual Congress. The FDA also took into consideration positive interim results from the single-arm, open-label ILLUMINATE-B Phase 3 pediatric study. Primary analysis results from the ILLUMINATE-B study were presented in October 2020 at the virtual American Society of Nephrology Annual Congress.

In ILLUMINATE-A, the efficacy and safety of OXLUMO were evaluated in 39 patients ages six and older with relatively preserved renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] at or above 30 mL/min/1.73m2) and a documented diagnosis of PH1. The study, conducted in eight countries around the world, is the largest interventional study conducted specifically in PH1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive three monthly doses of OXLUMO or placebo at 3 mg/kg followed by a quarterly dosing regimen. The study showed that OXLUMO met its primary endpoint, percent change in 24-hour urinary oxalate (corrected for body surface area and averaged from months three to six). Specifically, treatment with OXLUMO resulted in a 65 percent mean reduction in urinary oxalate relative to baseline versus 12 percent reduction reported in response to placebo, resulting in a mean treatment difference of 53 percent relative to placebo (p=1.7×10-14). In addition, OXLUMO achieved statistically significant results for all six tested secondary endpoints, including the proportion of patients achieving urinary oxalate levels at or below upper limit of normal1 (13/25 patients or 52 percent; p=0.001) and at or below 1.5x upper limit of normal2 (21/25 patients or 84 percent; p=8.3 x 10-7), compared with none (0/13) of the patients receiving placebo. During the primary analysis period, OXLUMO demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile, with no serious or severe adverse events. The most common adverse reaction was ISRs (reported in at least 20 percent of patients); ISRs occurred at various time points during the study period and included erythema, pain, pruritus, and swelling. These symptoms were generally mild and resolved within one day of the injection and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment.

In ILLUMINATE-B, a study in PH1 patients under the age of six with relatively preserved renal function (eGFR above 45 mL/min/1.73m2), OXLUMO was evaluated in 18 patients during the primary analysis, including infants as young as three months old. It was administered according to a weight-based dosing regimen across three body weight categories (less than 10 kg; 10 to less than 20 kg, and 20 kg or higher). In the primary analysis, OXLUMO demonstrated a 72 percent mean reduction in spot urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio from baseline to month six (averaged from months three to six) – the primary endpoint of the study. The reduction of oxalate was consistent across all three body weight categories. In addition, OXLUMO demonstrated positive results across secondary endpoints, including additional measures of oxalate. There were no serious or severe adverse events related to study drug, and the overall safety and tolerability profile of OXLUMO was consistent with that observed in the ILLUMINATE-A pivotal study.

“PH1 patients experience progressive and often inevitable decline in kidney function. As the disease advances, so does the risk of end-stage kidney disease and systemic spread of oxalate beyond the kidneys endangering other organs, including the eyes, bones, skin and heart. This condition, systemic oxalosis, leads to multi-organ dysfunction and death. The age of onset, rate of disease progression, and associated clinical manifestations can vary significantly from patient to patient, even among members of the same family, making PH1 a particularly challenging condition to diagnose and treat. Until today, there had been no approved nonsurgical treatment options available that curb oxalate overproduction in patients with PH1, with liver transplantation being the only preemptive treatment approach to address the underlying metabolic defect in these patients,” said Jeffrey M. Saland, M.D., Professor and Chief, Pediatric Nephrology and Hypertension, Jack and Lucy Clark Department of Pediatrics, Mount Sinai Kravis Children’s Hospital, New York City and Investigator on the ILLUMINATE-A trial. “The consistent efficacy and safety profile of OXLUMO demonstrated in the ILLUMINATE-A and -B trials both in adults and children from as young as a few months old, combined with an infrequent dosing regimen that leads to rapid and sustained reduction of oxalate production, make OXLUMO an attractive therapeutic option to reduce the oxalate burden responsible for the severe clinical manifestations that individuals suffer due to PH1.”

“Many people impacted by PH1 face persistent anxiety related to the unpredictable nature of their condition, in terms of the uncertainty of how quickly their disease may progress, and the prospect of needing intensive dialysis and a kidney/liver transplant that threaten their physical, emotional and financial health,” said Kim Hollander, Executive Director of the Oxalosis and Hyperoxaluria Foundation. “The FDA approval of OXLUMO represents a new path forward for many, providing an effective treatment option and a sense of hope.”

“PH1 has had a profound impact on my son’s life from a physical, emotional and social standpoint. As a young boy, it has been draining for him to be constantly in pain, live through countless kidney stones – experiencing them on a regular basis – have limited control of his body, miss out on school and not be able to participate in sports,” said Amy Bowders, the mother and caregiver of a 12-year old boy diagnosed with PH1. “With the approval of OXLUMO, we are truly hopeful and optimistic about the future for patients affected by PH1.”

OXLUMO is expected to be available for shipment to healthcare providers in the U.S. by year-end. HCPs can initiate the process now by visiting www.AlnylamAssist.com and completing and submitting a Start Form.

OXLUMO was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and had previously been granted Breakthrough Therapy, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations. With the approval of OXLUMO, the FDA has granted Alnylam a pediatric rare disease priority review voucher that entitles the Company to designate a single new drug application to qualify for a priority review in the future. On November 19, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for OXLUMO for the treatment of PH1 in all age groups, following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Lumasiran was previously granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) Designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as well as Orphan Designation in the European Union. Lumasiran was also granted an Accelerated Assessment by the EMA, which is awarded to medicines deemed to be of major public health interest and therapeutic innovation and is designed to bring new treatments to patients more quickly.

The safety and efficacy of OXLUMO are also being evaluated in the ongoing ILLUMINATE-C Phase 3 clinical trial in patients of all ages with advanced PH1, including patients on dialysis. Together, the ILLUMINATE studies comprise a comprehensive clinical development program intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of OXLUMO across the full spectrum of patients diagnosed with PH1.

About OXLUMO™ (lumasiran)
OXLUMO is an RNAi therapeutic targeting hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) to lower urinary oxalate levels in pediatric and adult patients. HAO1 encodes glycolate oxidase (GO), an enzyme upstream of the disease-causing defect in PH1. OXLUMO works by degrading HAO1 messenger RNA and reducing the synthesis of GO, which inhibits hepatic production of oxalate – the toxic metabolite responsible for the clinical manifestations of PH1. In the pivotal ILLUMINATE-A study, OXLUMO was shown to significantly reduce levels of urinary oxalate relative to placebo, with the majority of patients reaching normal or near-normal levels. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were the most common drug-related adverse reaction. In the ILLUMINATE-B pediatric Phase 3 study, OXLUMO demonstrated an efficacy and safety profile consistent to that observed in ILLUMINATE-A. OXLUMO utilizes Alnylam’s Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc conjugate technology designed to increase potency and durability. OXLUMO is administered via subcutaneous injection once monthly for three months, then once quarterly thereafter at a dose based on actual body weight. For patients who weigh less than 10 kg, ongoing dosing remains monthly. OXLUMO should be administered by a healthcare professional. For more information about OXLUMO, visit OXLUMO.com.

About Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1)
PH1 is an ultra-rare genetic disease that affects an estimated one to three individuals per million in the United States and Europe. PH1 is characterized by oxalate overproduction in the liver. The excess oxalate results in the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract and can lead to the formation of painful and recurrent kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis. Renal damage is caused by a combination of tubular toxicity from oxalate, calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys, and urinary obstruction by calcium oxalate stones. PH1 is associated with a progressive decline in kidney function, which exacerbates the disease as the excess oxalate can no longer be effectively excreted, resulting in subsequent accumulation and deposition of oxalate in bones, eyes, skin, and heart, leading to severe illness and death. Management options to date were limited to hyperhydration, crystallization inhibitors and, in a minority of patients with a specific genotype, pyridoxine (vitamin B6). These measures do not adequately address oxalate overproduction but instead help to delay inevitable progression to kidney failure and the need for intensive dialysis as a bridge to a dual or sequential liver/kidney transplant. Liver transplantation is the only intervention that addresses the underlying metabolic defect, but is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and life-long immunosuppression. Until today, there were no approved pharmaceutical therapies for PH1.

About RNAi
RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing or disease pathway proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

52680,Russia's Sputnik V Demonstrates 91.4% Efficacy Against COVID-19,SECOND INTERIM ANALYSIS OF CLINICAL TRIAL DATA SHOWED A 91.4% EFFICACY FOR THE SPUTNIK V VACCINE ON DAY 28 AFTER THE FIRST DOSE; VACCINE EFFICACY IS OVER 95% 42 DAYS AFTER THE FIRST DOSE,"The ongoing P-lll study involves assessing of Sputnik V vaccine vs PBO in 40,000 patients in a ratio (1:3) with COVID-19. The efficacy of the vaccine is 91.4%, based on the second interim analysis of data obtained 28 days after administering the first dose
 Preliminary data from volunteers obtained 42days after the first dose (corresponds with 21days after the second dose) indicates the efficacy of the vaccine above 95%.
 The data will be published by the Gamaleya Center team in peer-reviewed medical journals. Following the completion of P-lll clinical trials, Gamaleya Center will provide access to the full clinical trial report","The efficacy of the Sputnik V vaccine is 91.4%, based on the second interim analysis of data obtained 28 days after administering the first dose (7 days after the second dose).
Calculation was based on the analysis of data on volunteers (n = 18,794) who received both the first and second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine or placebo at the second control point (39 confirmed cases as of November 23, 2020) in accordance with the clinical trial protocol.
Preliminary data from volunteers obtained 42 days after the first dose (corresponds with 21 days after the second dose) indicates an efficacy of the vaccine above 95%.
The interim research data will be published by the Gamaleya Center team in one of the leading international peer-reviewed medical journals. Following the completion of Phase III clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine, Gamaleya Center will provide access to the full clinical trial report.
Currently, 40,000 volunteers are taking part in the Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical post-registration study of the Sputnik V vaccine in Russia, of whom more than 22,000 volunteers were vaccinated with the first dose and more than 19,000 volunteers with the first and second doses.
There were no unexpected adverse events during the trials. Monitoring of the participants is ongoing.
The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vector platform that has proven safe and effective with no long-term side effects in more than 250 clinical trials globally conducted during the past two decades – while the history of the use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development began in 1953. More than 100,000 people have received approved and registered drugs based on human adenoviral vectors.
The uniqueness of the Russian vaccine lies in the use of two different human adenoviral vectors which allows for a stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to the vaccines using one and the same vector for two doses.
Moscow, November 24, 2020 – The National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N.F. Gamaleya of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (Gamaleya Center) and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund), announce positive results obtained during the second interim data analysis of the largest double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials in Russia’s history involving 40,000 volunteers. Gamaleya Center experts have once again confirmed the high efficacy of the Sputnik V vaccine, the world’s first registered vaccine against coronavirus based on a well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors. Evaluation of efficacy was carried out among volunteers (n = 18,794) 28 days after receiving the first dose (7 days after the second dose) of the vaccine or placebo upon reaching the second check point of the trial in compliance with the clinical trial protocol. The analysis demonstrated a 91.4% efficacy rate for the Sputnik V vaccine.

table_eng_spu.jpg
According to the protocol of Phase III clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine, its interim efficacy is calculated at three statistically significant representative check points – upon reaching 20, 39 and 78 cases of novel coronavirus infection among volunteers both in the placebo group and in the group that received the vaccine. The second interim analysis of the Sputnik V vaccine efficacy was carried out on the basis of 39 confirmed cases identified in the placebo group (31 cases) and in the vaccine group (8 cases). The ratio of the placebo group to the vaccinated group is 1 to 3.

The uniqueness of the Russian vaccine lies in the use of two different vectors based on the human adenovirus, which allows for a stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to vaccines using one and same vector for two doses. So, preliminary data on volunteers on the 42nd day after the first dose (equivalent to 21 days after the second dose), when they have already formed a stable immune response, indicates the efficacy rate of the vaccine is above 95%.

The next interim data analysis will be conducted upon reaching the third check point of 78 confirmed coronavirus cases among the study participants. Final data analysis will be available by the end of Phase III clinical trials.

The interim research data will be published by the Gamaleya Center team in one of the leading international peer-reviewed medical journals. Following the completion of Phase III clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine, Gamaleya Center will provide access to the full clinical trial report.

As of November 24 more than 22,000 volunteers were vaccinated with the first dose and more than 19,000 volunteers with the first and the second dose of the vaccine at 29 medical centers in Russia as part of the ongoing clinical trials. Currently Phase III clinical trials are approved and are ongoing in Belarus, the UAE, Venezuela and other countries, as well as Phase II-III in India.

As of November 24, no unexpected adverse events were identified as part of the research. Some of those vaccinated had short-term minor adverse events such as pain at the injection point and flu-like symptoms including fever, weakness, fatigue, and headache.

During the clinical trials, the safety of the vaccine is constantly being monitored; information is analyzed by the Independent Monitoring Committee comprising leading Russian scientists. Collection, quality control and data processing is conducted in line with ICH GCP standards and involves the active participation of Moscow’s Health Department and Crocus Medical, the contract research organization (CRO).

Mikhail Murashko, Minister of Health of the Russian Federation, said:

“The data demonstrating high efficacy of the Sputnik V vaccine give us hope that we will soon obtain the most important tool in the fight against the pandemic of the novel coronavirus infection”.

Alexander Gintsburg, Gamaleya Center Director, said:

“It is very important that the second interim efficacy analysis of Sputnik V has confirmed our findings from the first stage and shown its efficacy at 91-92%. Let me stress that the second analysis was conducted a week after volunteers got the second dose, meaning that their bodies have partially reacted to both doses. We expect the efficacy rate to be even higher based on the data three weeks after the second immunization when the body’s strongest and most stable response is achieved. We plan to conduct the third interim data analysis after 78 confirmed coronavirus cases among volunteers and we have every reason to believe that the results will exceed our initial expectations. The drug’s final efficacy assessment will be made available after Phase III clinical trials are concluded.”

Denis Logunov, Gamaleya Center Deputy Director, commented:

“Results from the second interim analysis of the Sputnik V vaccine are in line with our expectations and predictions. The vaccine’s high efficacy rate is an important indication that a stable immune response to the coronavirus infection is formed among the study’s participants. We expect that the next interim results will demonstrate Sputnik V’s positive traits, moving us closer to the study’s completion and the beginning of a mass vaccination of our fellow citizens.”

Kirill Dmitriev, CEO, Russian Direct Investment Fund, said:

“Gamaleya Center has developed one of the most efficient vaccines against coronavirus in the world with an efficacy rate of more than 90% and a price that is two times lower than that of other vaccines with similar efficacy rate. The uniqueness of the Russian vaccine lies in the use of two different human adenoviral vectors which allows for a stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to the vaccines using one and the same vector for two doses.”

***

The safety of vaccines based on human adenoviruses has been confirmed in more than 75 international publications and more than 250 clinical trials conducted during the past two decades – while the history of use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development started in 1953. Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so called “spikes” forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body’s stable immune response.

On September 4, The Lancet, one of world’s leading medical journals, published a research paper on the results of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of the vaccine that showed no serious adverse events and an effective immune response of those vaccinated.

Requests for more than 1.2 billion doses of Sputnik V vaccine came from more than 50 countries. The vaccine supplies for the global market will be produced by RDIF’s international partners in India, Brazil, China, South Korea and other countries.

On August 11, the Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Center was registered by Russia’s Health Ministry and became the world’s first registered vaccine against COVID-19. Detailed information on the Sputnik V vaccine, its human adenoviral vectors technological platform, and other details are available at sputnikvaccine.com

52695,Evotec Collaborates with Rappta Therapeutics to Focus on Oncology Target,Evotec and Rappta Therapeutics Enter Discovery and Development Partnership Focused on Oncology Target,"Evotec to receive research funding & is eligible for milestones. Evotec will support Rappta’s program of developing small molecule activators of the enzyme PP2A
 The collaboration leverages Evotec’s integrated platform for drug discovery and development and its oncology expertise coupled with state-of-the-art technologies
 PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase that functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating multiple oncogenic signaling pathways responsible for driving cancer progression","HAMBURG, GERMANY / ACCESSWIRE / November 24, 2020 / Evotec SE (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: EVT, MDAX/TecDAX, ISIN: DE0005664809) today announced a new multi-year drug development partnership with Rappta Therapeutics, a Finland-based biopharmaceutical company, focused on an innovative oncology target.

Under the partnership, Evotec will support Rappta’s programme of developing small molecule activators of the enzyme Protein Phosphatase 2A (“PP2A”), which downregulates multiple oncogenic signalling pathways responsible for driving cancer progression. Although PP2A is a key tumour suppressor and has a critical function regulating protein de-phosphorylation and tumour growth, it has to-date been very difficult to target pharmaceutically.

Through its deep understanding of PP2A biology and the use of proprietary technology, Rappta has uniquely defined the PP2A target which has allowed them to come up with a series of first-in-class compounds which glue the three subunits of PP2A together, thus driving PP2A complex reformation and restoring its tumour suppressive function. Evotec and Rappta intend to develop the programme which is currently in the late lead optimisation stage towards IND-enabling studies over the course of their partnership.

The collaboration leverages Evotec’s industry-leading integrated platform for drug discovery and development including Evotec’s oncology expertise coupled with state-of-the-art technologies to maximise probability of success even in fields of cutting-edge and difficult science. Evotec receives undisclosed research funding and is eligible for success-based milestone payments.

ABOUT PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A
Reversible phosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism controlling all cell signaling and communication and this process is regulated through the opposing actions of phosphatases (which remove phosphate groups from proteins) and kinases (which add phosphate groups to proteins). Altered cellular signaling as a result of protein hyperphosphorylation, results in the sustained growth of malignant cells and is a hallmark of human cancer development and progression. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating multiple oncogenic signaling pathways responsible for driving cancer progression. PP2A is made up of three subunits, that form a complete and active enzyme when bound together. The active enzyme is comprised of a scaffolding subunit (A), serving as the structural platform for the assembly of the catalytic (C) subunit and one substrate directing regulatory (B) subunit. In cancer, the tumor-suppressive activity of PP2A is often disrupted as a result of the inability of the three subunits to bind together correctly, rendering the PP2A enzyme inactive. This inactivation of PP2A, leads to increased oncogenic signaling, driving cancer progression and growth. Therefore, the reactivation of PP2A affords a unique therapeutic strategy to restore PP2A activity and cellular homeostasis, that can be used for the treatment of cancer and a broad range of other diseases.

 Combined results: achieved 1EPs of ACR20 @24wks.; improvements in quality of life scores; improvement in PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 rates. In DISCOVER-2 study, @24wks. less radiographic progression in both groups Tremfya is the first selective IL-23 p19 subunit inhibitor licensed for both the treatment of PsA and PsO","BEERSE, Belgium, November 25, 2020 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved TREMFYA®▼ (guselkumab) for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy.
Guselkumab is the first approved fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL23 receptor. It is already approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. IL-23 is an important driver of the progression of inflammatory diseases including psoriasis and PsA, among others.1
CP-192740 Page 2 of 9
November 2020
PsA is a multifaceted, chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease that is progressive and is characterised by debilitating joint damage and inflammation, in addition to enthesitis, dactylitis, axial disease, and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis. The pain, stiffness and swelling of the joints and connective tissue can be severe and cause everyday tasks to become difficult.
2,3 In addition, more than half of people with PsA also live with another condition, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel disease or depression.
4,5 There is currently no known cure for PsA, and it is estimated that up to a third of the 14 million people living with psoriasis in Europe will go on to develop PsA.

6,7 “Psoriatic arthritis is a progressive and debilitating disease and can have a huge impact not only on quality of life, but also on a person’s mental health. We welcome the news that guselkumab is now approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis,” said Jan Koren, President, European Federation of Psoriasis Patient Organisations (EUROPSO)*. “For patients, having more innovative treatment options available that improve the quality of life is good news, which we believe will bring hope to many patients in need of additional treatment options. We must now work to make this treatment accessible to patients across the European Union.”
Approval for this new indication is based on results from the DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 Phase 3 clinical studies, which assessed safety and efficacy of guselkumab 100 mg q4w and q8w in adult patients with active PsA. DISCOVER-1 evaluated 381 participants with active PsA who had an inadequate response to standard therapies, including participants (~30 percent) previously treated with antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha biologics.8 DISCOVER-2 included 739 patients who were biologic-naïve only and had an inadequate response to standard therapies.9 Data from these studies was published earlier this year in The Lancet (24-weeks;
DISCOVER-1, DISCOVER 2).
8,9
• The published results show that in both studies, at week 24, adult patients with active PsA achieved statistical significance in the primary endpoint of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 percent improvement (ACR20)

response (DISCOVER-1: p<0.001; DISCOVER-2: p<0.001) in both q4w and q8w guselkumab groups (DISCOVER-1: n=255; DISCOVER-2: n=493) vs the placebo groups (DISCOVER-1: n=126; DISCOVER-2: n= 246).
10,11
• In addition, significant improvements in quality of life scores (36-item shortform [SF36] physical component summary) were observed in the guselkumab
groups vs the placebo groups in DISCOVER-1 (p<0.001 for both doses); in DISCOVER-2, significant improvements were observed in the q4w guselkumab group vs placebo group (p=0.0056 [q8w, p=0.068]).10,11
• In DISCOVER 2, inhibition of structural damage progression was measured radiographically and expressed as the mean change from baseline in the total modified van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score. At week 24, the guselkumab q4w group demonstrated statistically significantly less radiographic
progression (p=0.006) and the guselkumab q8w group showed numerically less progression than placebo (p=0.068).
11 At week 52, the mean change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score was similar in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (mean scores of 0.97 and 1.07 respectively).
12
• In addition, higher Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 percent improvement (PASI 75), PASI 90 and PASI 100 response rates were observed in the q4w and q8w guselkumab groups vs the placebo groups (in DISCOVER-1, all unadjusted p<0.001 with PASI 100 being p=0.0005 and in DISCOVER-2, all unadjusted p<0.001).
8,9
In both studies, guselkumab was well-tolerated, and observed adverse events (AEs) were generally consistent with previous studies of guselkumab and current prescribing information. In DISCOVER-1 and -2, serious adverse events up to week 24 in q4w treatment arms (0 and 3 percent) and q8w treatment arms (3 and 1 percent) were similar to those in the placebo arms (4 and 3 percent). In DISCOVER2, less than 1 percent of patients experienced serious infections following guselkumab treatment, and no patient experienced serious infections following guselkumab treatment in DISCOVER-1. There were no reported deaths in guselkumab-treated patients and no guselkumab-treated patient had inflammatory bowel disease, opportunistic infections such as tinea or candida, active tuberculosis or anaphylactic
CP-192740 Page 4 of 9

or serum sickness-like reactions.8,9 “Guselkumab represents a new treatment option – the first in its class – for patients with psoriatic arthritis, in an area where additional treatment options are needed. The DISCOVER 1 and 2 studies, which this approval is based on, show the potential of guselkumab to improve skin and joint symptoms, including structural joint damage, which are all important elements of sustained management of psoriatic arthritis,” said David M. Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Immunology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Today’s approval marks an exciting breakthrough as we continue to reimagine what is possible in how immunemediated diseases like active PsA are understood and treated.”
This marketing authorisation follows a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA),
issued on 15 October.

About Psoriatic Arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by peripheral joint inflammation, enthesitis (pain where the bone, tendon and ligament meet), dactylitis (severe inflammation of the finger and toe joints), axial disease, and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis.3,17,18
In addition,
in patients with PsA, comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, anxiety and depression are often present.5 Studies show that up to 30 percent of the 14 million people in Europe living with psoriasis can also develop PsA.
6,7 The disease causes pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the joints; it commonly appears between the ages of 30 and 50, but can develop at any time.19 Though the exact cause of PsA is unknown, genes, the immune system and environmental factors are all believed to play a role in the onset of the disease.19

52769,Urovant's Vibegron Fails to Meet its Primary Endpoint in P-IIa Study for IBS Pain,Urovant Sciences Announces Topline Data from Phase 2a Study of Vibegron for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Pain Did Not Meet Primary Endpoint,"The P-IIa study involves assessing vibegron (75mg,qd) in 222 women with abdominal pain due to IBS with IBS-D (diarrhea) and IBS-M (mixed IBS) across 35 sites in the US
 The study did not meet its 1EPs i.e. at least a 30 percent improvement in average worst abdominal pain @12wks. ( 40.9% vs 42.9%), well tolerated and did not lead to worsening of IBS symptoms
 Vibegron is (PO,qd) is a beta-3 agonist that is being evaluated for OAB, OAB+BPH in men & for abdominal pain associated with IBS","IRVINE, Calif. & BASEL, Switzerland–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Urovant Sciences (Nasdaq: UROV) today reported topline data from the Phase 2a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating once-daily vibegron 75 mg in women with abdominal pain due to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with IBS-D (diarrhea) and IBS-M (mixed IBS).

“While we are disappointed by the topline results from this Phase 2a trial, we want to sincerely thank the patients, investigators and their site staff who participated”

A total of 222 female IBS patients were enrolled at 35 sites in the United States, 189 of whom completed the 12-week study. In the primary efficacy analysis, the study did not meet the primary endpoint with 40.9 percent of vibegron IBS-D patients achieving at least a 30 percent improvement in average worst abdominal pain over the week 12 period, compared to 42.9 percent in the placebo group. A responder was defined as a subject with at least a 30 percent decrease in “worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours” compared to the weekly baseline average over the 12-week period.

The most important secondary endpoint demonstrated 42.4 percent of Global Improvement Scale (GIS) responders at Week 12 for IBS-D patients in the vibegron group, compared with 33.3 percent for placebo but this was not statistically significant for the IBS-D, IBS-M or the overall IBS population. Urovant will continue to analyze the full data set of this study.

Vibegron was very well tolerated in the study and did not lead to any worsening of IBS symptoms. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 0 percent in the vibegron group and 2.7 percent in placebo. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms with 1 serious adverse effect in the placebo group and 2 in the vibegron treatment group which were not considered treatment related by the investigator. The adverse events reported for vibegron were in the placebo range (33.3 percent in both groups). In particular, the adverse events of worsening of IBS were 2.7 percent for both vibegron and placebo and the adverse event of diarrhea was 0 percent for vibegron 75 mg and 1.8 percent for placebo respectively.

“While we are disappointed by the topline results from this Phase 2a trial, we want to sincerely thank the patients, investigators and their site staff who participated,” said Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of Urovant Sciences. “We look forward to advancing our Phase 3 program for vibegron in men with overactive bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as well as our Phase 2a program for URO-902 in OAB and look forward to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) upcoming assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of December 26, 2020 for the New Drug Application (NDA) for vibegron to treat overactive bladder (OAB).”

About Irritable Bowel Syndrome Related Pain

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with two or more of the following symptoms: defecation, change in stool frequency, and/or change in stool form or appearance. In the United States, approximately 30 million to 40 million have IBS symptoms, 30 percent of whom consult with a physician.1 Approximately 80 percent of these patients identify pain as a symptom contributing to the severity of their IBS2 and it is estimated 7.2 million to 9.6 million IBS patients suffer from IBS-associated pain.1 While there are approved therapies for IBS with constipation and IBS with diarrhea, these therapies do not adequately address IBS-associated pain. Moreover, there are no currently marketed drugs indicated specifically for IBS-associated pain.3

About Vibegron

Vibegron is an oral, once-daily small molecule beta-3 agonist that is being evaluated for overactive bladder (OAB), OAB in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (OAB+BPH) and for abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Urovant has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for vibegron in OAB to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA), which has an assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of December 26th. Data available to date on vibegron, which includes an international Phase 3 safety and efficacy study for OAB, indicate vibegron is well tolerated. If approved, vibegron would be the first new branded prescription drug for the treatment of OAB in nearly a decade and would offer these suffering patients another potential treatment option.

 The indication is approved under accelerated approval regulation based on ORR and DOR. Continued approval for the indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefits in a confirmatory trial
 Danyelza is a mAb that targets the ganglioside GD2 which is highly expressed in various neuroectoderm-derived tumors and sarcomas and has received PR, ODD, BT and RPD from the US FDA","NEW YORK, Nov. 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Y-mAbs Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company” or “Y-mAbs”) (Nasdaq: YMAB) a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel, antibody-based therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has approved DANYELZA (naxitamab-gqgk) 40mg/10ml. DANYELZA is indicated, in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (“GM-CSF”), for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and adult patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow who have demonstrated a partial response, minor response, or stable disease to prior therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval regulation based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefits in a confirmatory trial. DANYELZA is a humanized, monoclonal antibody that targets the ganglioside GD2, which is highly expressed in various neuroectoderm-derived tumors and sarcomas. DANYELZA is administered to patients three times in a week in an outpatient setting and the treatment is repeated every four weeks. The product has received Priority Review, Orphan Drug, Breakthrough Therapy, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the FDA.

“Today is an important day for children living with refractory/relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma,” said Thomas Gad, founder, Chairman and President. “It’s very exciting to see this treatment go from being an experimental therapy used at my daughter’s bedside to now being FDA approved. On behalf of Y-mAbs, I want to thank all the patients and physicians who took part in our clinical trials and our scientific partner, Memorial Sloan Kettering, for helping us achieve this goal.”

“We believe that DANYELZA in combination with GM-CSF is a much-needed treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow who have historically not had approved treatments available. This approval of Y-mAbs’ first BLA represents a key step in working towards our mission of becoming a world leader in developing better and safer antibody-based oncology products addressing unmet pediatric and adult medical needs,” said Claus Moller, Chief Executive Officer.

The FDA approval of DANYELZA is supported by clinical evidence from two pivotal studies in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma with refractory or relapsed disease. DANYELZA appears to be well tolerated with few discontinuations of treatment in the clinical trials and adverse events were clinically manageable. See below for information related to adverse reactions.

The FDA granted approval under the accelerated approval regulation. The postmarketing clinical trial required by the FDA to verify and to further characterize the clinical benefit is the ongoing Study 201, which will enroll a minimum of 80 patients and report overall response rate (“ORR”), duration of response (“DOR”), progression free survival (“PFS”) and overall survival (“OS”). The ORR is the primary endpoint for the study, DOR is the secondary endpoint, PFS and OS are secondary endpoints in long-term follow up.

DANYELZA is expected to be available in the United States in the coming weeks. To learn more about DANYELZA, visit DANYELZA.com. To help patients get started on DANYELZA, Y-mAbs ConnectTM has been created to answer questions about access, health insurance coverage, financial support programs and other resources available for qualifying patients.

Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (“MSK”) developed DANYELZA, which is exclusively licensed by MSK to Y-mAbs. As a result of this licensing arrangement, MSK has institutional financial interests related to the compound and Y-mAbs.

About High-Risk Neuroblastoma

Neuroblastoma is a solid tumor of childhood that arises in the nervous system, outside of the brain. The clinical behavior of neuroblastoma is highly variable, with some tumors being easily treatable, but the majority being very aggressive. All patients are staged based on the International Neuroblastoma Staging System Committee (“INSS”) system, ranging from stage 1 through stage 4S. All patients with stage 4 disease diagnosed after one year of age are classified in the high-risk category, where the neuroblastoma tumor cells have already metastasized to other sites in the body, such as the bone or bone marrow. Essentially all patients who have tumors with many copies, or amplification, of the MYCN oncogene also have high-risk disease, even if they do not have evidence of the tumor having spread.

52823,Merck KGaA Reports EMA's Validation of MAA for Tepotinib to Treat Advanced NSCLC with METex14 Skipping Alterations,European Medicines Agency Validates Application for Tepotinib for the Treatment of Advanced NSCLC with METex14 Skipping Alterations,"The MAA is based on a P-II VISION study assessing Tepotinib as monothx. in patients with advanced NSCLC of METex14 skipping alterations, prospectively assessed by liquid biopsy or tissue biopsy
 With the validation, the application is complete, and the EMA will now initiate the review procedure.
 Tepotinib is an oral MET inhibitor that inhibits the oncogenic MET receptor signaling caused by MET alteration. The FDA is reviewing the application under PR and through the Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program","DARMSTADT, Germany, Nov. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated for review, the application for tepotinib for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor gene (MET) exon 14 (METex14) skipping alterations. With this validation, the application is complete, and the EMA will now begin the review procedure.

Tepotinib is a highly selective oral MET inhibitor that is administered once daily.1 The application to the EMA is based on results from the pivotal Phase II VISION study (NCT02864992) evaluating tepotinib as monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC with METex14 skipping alterations, prospectively assessed by liquid biopsy or tissue biopsy. In the ongoing study, the patient population is generally characterized as elderly, with a median age of 74.0 years, and as having poor clinical prognosis typical of NSCLC with METex14 skipping alterations. Data from the primary analysis of the VISION study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on May 29, 2020.2

Lung cancer is estimated to be the second most common cancer in Europe, and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, responsible for 388,000 deaths in 2018.3 METex14 skipping occurs in approximately 3–4% of NSCLC cases and correlates with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis.4 Currently, there are no treatments available in Europe for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring METex14 skipping alterations.

Tepotinib became the first oral MET inhibitor indicated for the treatment of advanced NSCLC harboring MET gene alterations to receive a regulatory approval globally, with its approval in Japan in March 2020 through the SAKIGAKE program. Recently, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to tepotinib and the FDA is reviewing the application under Priority Review and through the Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program.

About Tepotinib

Tepotinib is an oral MET inhibitor that inhibits the oncogenic MET receptor signaling caused by MET (gene) alterations. Discovered and developed in-house at Merck, it has a highly selective mechanism of action, with the potential to improve outcomes in aggressive tumors that have a poor prognosis and harbor these specific alterations.1

Additional Clinical Investigations: Tepotinib is also being investigated in the Phase II INSIGHT 2 study in combination with osimertinib in MET amplified, advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations that has progressed following first-line treatment with osimertinib, and in the Phase II PERSPECTIVE study in combination with cetuximab in RAS/BRAF wild-type left-sided metastatic colorectal cancer patients having acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibody targeting therapy due to MET amplification.

In the future, it will be possible to meet customer and market requirements quicker, more efficiently and more flexibly
Merck invests € 10 million in modular technical infrastructure
Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced a collaborative partnership with Siemens for the digitalization of production. This partnership is to result in the development of a process control system for the modular production of innovative materials and products for the electronics, pharmaceutical and life science industries. A first state-of-the-art, modular plant in this production environment is to be built at the Darmstadt site of Merck by 2022. In the first phase, Merck will invest € 10 million in the realization of this plant. The project is part of a € 1 billion investment program announced last year for global headquarters in Darmstadt up until 2025. It will also be funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy because, thanks to the modular, flexible and efficient technology, the carbon footprint of production can be reduced.

“In the smart factory of tomorrow, everything will revolve around flexibility, networking and efficiency,” said Kai Beckmann, CEO Performance Materials and Executive Board member of Merck responsible for the Darmstadt site. “The time needed from the product idea to market readiness is a critical success factor. The resulting technology platform for standardized, modular production will also be usable in product development in the future. This allows data-based decisions to be made as early as the product development phase and applied seamlessly to the production process. Therefore, in the future, we will be able to respond quicker and even more flexibly to high customer requirements.”

“We know that new production plants have to be more flexible and more efficient in order to support faster product changes. We are therefore delighted to be partnering with Merck. This will create new opportunities for us to drive forward modular production and to meet growing requirements for chemical and pharmaceutical processes in our joint development work,” said Eckard Eberle, CEO of Siemens Process Automation.

The objective of this collaboration between Merck and Siemens is the joint development of an overall system for automating the modular production of tomorrow.

Special software components (Module Type Packages, MTP) form the basis for managing modular production equipment. Using a supervisory control system, known as the process orchestration layer (POL), various production modules can be interlinked to an overall process. In the future, this should occur without additional programming effort – similar to the USB standard for electronic devices. Merck is taking on the establishment of the production infrastructure; Siemens is responsible for the development of POL technology.

Merck already has experience with modular production systems. The collaboration is meant to advance the concept of flexible and simple interlinking of individual modules globally in the process development and production network of all business sectors at Merck.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Website-Size-15.jpg,Pharma,Merck| Siemens,0,Pharma|Agreement|Collaborative|Digitalization|Sign,publish,27/11/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/digitalization-of-production-merck-and-siemens-collaborate/,https://pharmashots.com/52841/merck-collaborates-with-siemens-for-the-digitalization-of-production/

The companies collaborated to accelerate search for a therapeutic candidate
 PostEra will use its ML technology to optimize NeuroLucent’s lead compounds through a series of design make test cycles that has previously been shown to accelerate medicinal chemistry campaigns
 PostEra will also deploy its Manifold platform, providing access to compounds through a WW network of vendors and CROs","SAN FRANCISCO and NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., Nov. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — PostEra, a biotechnology company offering medicinal chemistry powered by machine learning, today announced a collaboration with NeuroLucent, a Chicago-based company focused on developing novel treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.

The failure of late-stage clinical trials to uncover effective therapies for Alzheimer’s disease has underscored the need to explore novel therapeutic approaches. NeuroLucent is developing novel small molecule compounds that normalize a key calcium channel that is dysregulated in Alzheimer’s neurons and restore normal neuronal function in multiple preclinical Alzheimer’s models.

PostEra and NeuroLucent collaborate on identifying small-molecule therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease

NeuroLucent has partnered with PostEra to accelerate its search for a therapeutic candidate. PostEra will use its machine learning technology to optimise NeuroLucent’s lead compounds through a series of ‘design-make-test’ cycles that has previously been shown to accelerate medicinal chemistry campaigns. PostEra will also leverage its Manifold platform, which provides access to compounds through a world-wide network of vendors and partner contract research organizations.

Commercial terms include an upfront payment to PostEra, with additional payments upon the achievement of certain milestones.

“We’re excited about the potential of integrating PostEra’s technology into the design of more potent compounds,” said Bill Kohlbrenner, CEO of NeuroLucent. “We are intrigued by PostEra’s machine learning algorithm since it doesn’t require detailed structural information related to the drug target. We’re looking forward to seeing what impact PostEra’s AI solutions will have on our program.”

About NeuroLucent

NeuroLucent holds an exclusive license to technology developed at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science by Dr. Grace (Beth) Stutzmann, who uncovered a link between aberrant Ca2+ signalling, long known to occur in Alzheimer’s neurons, and a Ca2+ channel that becomes ‘leaky’ in disease. NeuroLucent’s preclinical stage compounds have been validated in multiple disease models and the current company focus is on identifying a clinical development candidate that addresses the cognitive loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease.

About PostEra

52867,BASE10 Collaborates with DNA Link to Support Authorization of COVID-19 IgG Antibody Test at the Point of Care,BASE10 and DNA Link Partners on Research to Support Authorization of Antibody Test at the Point of Care,"The companies collaborated to evaluate the usability of DNA Link’s AccuFind COVID-19 IgG antibody test in a healthcare setting
 The study intends to expand access to antibody testing outside of laboratory settings
 The companies plan to launch the study in Dec’2020","CHICAGO, Nov. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BASE10 Genetics and DNA Link today announced their collaboration on a research project to evaluate the usability of DNA Link’s AccuFind COVID-19 IgG antibody test in a healthcare setting.

Although Covid-19 deaths and new confirmed cases continue to rise across nursing homes in the US, many of those infected do recover. This has led to growing interest in the relationship between antibodies and their protective value whether generated by previous Covid-19 exposure or by a vaccine, once available.

At present, most antibody tests on the market require samples to be sent to a lab for analysis. The extra cost and time associated has constrained population wide studies of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

“An antibody test that can be done at the point of care without the need for a lab can more quickly provide information clinicians and administrators need to make decisions for their nursing home patients and staff,” says Dr. Michael Fang, BASE10 CEO.

“This research is an important milestone in our efforts to expand access to antibody testing,” says Elizabeth Freund, VP of Innovation at BASE10. “DNA Link’s AccuFind performs very well in laboratory settings. The next logical step is to test its performance when used by healthcare professionals outside the lab. Many factors have the potential to affect test performance in lesser controlled settings so it’s an ambitious goal to be sure. However, if FDA believes the data demonstrates its safety and effectiveness under these conditions, we’ll be one step closer to FDA emergency use authorization for point of care use.”

The study is set to launch in December.

 The company is working with its strategic manufacturing partners, Lonza of Switzerland and ROVI of Spain, for manufacturing and fill-finish outside the US. Additionally, Moderna reported that the vaccine showed 94.5% efficacy","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Moderna, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced a supply agreement with the UK government for an additional 2 million doses of mRNA-1273, Moderna’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19, to the United Kingdom beginning in March 2021. The UK government has now secured 7 million doses of mRNA-1273. This confirmation comes as the UK continues its efforts to secure access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines by establishing a broad portfolio of the most promising vaccines.

“We appreciate the collaboration with the UK government as with many other governments and other key partners around the world,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “For almost a decade, Moderna has invested in creating and developing a novel platform for designing and manufacturing a new class of mRNA-based vaccines. We are proud of the progress on mRNA-1273 we have made to date including the positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 COVE study.”

On November 16, Moderna announced that the independent, NIH-appointed Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273, its vaccine candidate against COVID-19, has informed Moderna that the trial has met the statistical criteria pre-specified in the study protocol for efficacy, with a vaccine efficacy of 94.5%. This study, known as the COVE study, enrolled more than 30,000 participants in the U.S. and is being conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

On October 27, 2020, Moderna received confirmation that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom started the rolling review process of mRNA-1273.

Moderna continues to scale up its global manufacturing to be able to deliver approximately 500 million doses per year and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, beginning in 2021. The Company is working with its strategic manufacturing partners, Lonza of Switzerland and ROVI of Spain, for manufacturing and fill-finish outside of the United States. This is a dedicated supply chain to support Europe and countries other than the United States that enter into purchase agreements with Moderna.

About mRNA-1273

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was co-developed by Moderna and investigators from NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to the NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing. On May 12, the FDA granted mRNA-1273 Fast Track designation. On May 29, the first participants in each age cohort: adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300) were dosed in the Phase 2 study of mRNA-1273. On July 8, the Phase 2 study completed enrollment.

Results from the second interim analysis of the NIH-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups were published on September 29 in The New England Journal of Medicine. On July 28, results from a non-human primate preclinical viral challenge study evaluating mRNA-1273 were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. On July 14, an interim analysis of the original cohorts in the NIH-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. mRNA-1273 currently is not approved for use by any regulatory body.

BARDA is supporting the continued research and development of mRNA-1273 with $955 million in federal funding under Contract no. 75A50120C00034. BARDA is reimbursing Moderna for 100 percent of the allowable costs incurred by the Company for conducting the program described in the BARDA contract. The U.S. government has agreed to provide up to $1.525 billion to purchase supply of mRNA-1273 under U.S. Department of Defense Contract No. W911QY-20-C-0100.

 Result: The proportion of household members who developed influenza (1.9% vs 13.6%); well tolerated with no new safety signals identified
 Xofluza inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease in the PA protein and is a single-dose oral treatment for influenza which is different from all other currently available antiviral treatments","OSAKA, Japan, November, 27, 2020 – Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Osaka, Japan; President and CEO: Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D.; hereafter “Shionogi”) today announced that Shionogi received approval for the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for XOFLUZA® for the post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza virus infection. The sNDA is based on data from the phase III BLOCKSTONE study.1, 2
Vaccination is widely available for the prevention of influenza virus infection, but since the type of influenza virus that prevails varies depending on the season, vaccination alone is not enough to completely control viral infections, onset, and exacerbation. Therefore, prophylactic administration of anti-influenza virus drugs has become an important option for preventing influenza in high-risk patients including chronic lung disease, metabolic disorders, age ≥65 years,3 within family with confirmed ifluenza. In particular, in hospitals and facilities for the elderly, in addition to robust vaccination and infection prevention measures, it is recommended by JAID to proactively administer anti-influenza virus drugs to healthy individuals exposed to someone with influenza from an early stage.4

We are aware of and understand the concerns about the influenza season coinciding with theCOVID-19 pandemic this year. In addition to infection prevention measures such as droplet infection precautions and hand hygiene, vaccination is strongly recommended for the prevention of influenza virus infections, and the importance of preventing influenza is increasing.5 With this approval, single-dose Xofluza® has become a new option for the prevention of influenza post-exposure, and is expected to contribute not only for the treatment of influenza (as per its existing approval) but also now for prevention upon exposure.

Shionogi is committed to “Protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases” as our key focus. We are not limiting ourselves to the research and development of therapeutic medications, but are also focused on the total care of infectious disease through awareness building, prevention and diagnosis and suppression of exacerbation. Shionogi will continue to work diligently to collect and analyze data on the efficacy and safety of Xofluza® and provide information for appropriate use.

About the BLOCKSTONE Study1

BLOCKSTONE was a Phase III, double blind, multicenter, randomised, placebo-controlled, post-exposure prophylaxis study that evaluated a single-dose of Xofluza® compared with placebo in household members (adults and children) who were living with someone with an influenza infection confirmed by a rapid influenza diagnostic test (the ‘index patient’). The study was conducted by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. during the 2018-2019 flu season in Japan.

Those diagnosed with influenza were required to have onset of symptoms within less than 48 hours, and participants were required to have lived with those diagnosed for more than 48 hours. The participants were randomised to receive a single-dose of Xofluza® (dosed according to body weight) or placebo as a preventive measure against developing influenza.

Xofluza® showed a statistically significant prophylactic effect on influenza after a single-dose in people exposed to an infected household contact. The proportion of household members 12 years of age and older who developed influenza was 1.9% in participants treated with Xofluza® and 13.6% in the placebo-treated group. Xofluza® was well tolerated in this study and no new safety signals were identified. The result of the BLOCKSTONE study, which was recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. 1

 

About Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil)

Xofluza® discovered by Shionogi, has a novel mechanism of action that inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease in the polymerase acidic (PA) protein (in the United States Prescribing Information, this enzyme is stated as polymerase acidic endonuclease), an enzyme essential for viral replication. Xofluza® is a single-dose oral treatment for influenza, which is different from all other currently available antiviral treatments. In non-clinical studies, Xofluza® demonstrated an antiviral effect against a wide range of influenza viruses including oseltamivir-resistant strains and avian strains (H7N9, H5N1).6, 7

Shionogi and the Roche Group (hereafter “Roche”) are in a license and collaboration agreement to further develop and commercialize Xofluza®. Under the terms of this agreement, Roche holds worldwide rights to Xofluza® excluding Japan and Taiwan, where the rights are retained exclusively by Shionogi. Xofluza® is available many countries for the treatment of influenza types A and B, including Japan and the U.S.

In U.S., the FDA has approved for a sNDA for Xofluza® as a treatment to prevent influenza in people 12 years of age and older following contact with someone with influenza (known as post-exposure prophylaxis)

on November 23, 2020.8 On November 12th, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for XOFLUZA for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza in patients aged 12 years and above. In addition, the CHMP has also adopted a positive opinion for XOFLUZA for the preventive treatment (post-exposure prophylaxis) of influenza in individuals aged 12 years and above following contact with someone with influenza.9

Roche is conducting a phase III development program investigating Xofluza® in several populations, including children under the age of one year (NCT03653364), as well as to assess the potential to reduce transmission of influenza from an infected person to healthy people (NCT03969212). Shionogi filed sNDA for Xofluza® in Taiwan for the post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza virus infection in adults and children 12 years of age and older on March 31, 2020 based on the positive results from the Phase III BLOCKSTONE study.10

November 25, 2020 – Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Osaka, Japan; President and CEO: Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D.; hereafter “Shionogi”) and Nagasaki University (Administrative office: Nagasaki, Japan; President: Shigeru Kohno, M.D.,Ph.D.) have been under research collaboration in the field of infectious diseases focused on malaria from February 2019 (hereafter “Shionogi-Nagasaki”) 1. Shionogi-Nagasaki and The Kitasato Institute (Administrative office: Tokyo, Japan; President: Hirosuke Kobayashi, M.D.,Ph.D.; hereafter “Kitasato”), today announced the conclusion of the strategic research collaboration for the antimalarial drugs.

The Kitasato Institute, founded by the world-renowned pioneer of infectious diseases Dr. Shibasaburo Kitasato, is one of the leading infectious diseases research institute in Japan, as evidenced by the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine being awarded to Distinguished Emeritus Prof. Dr. Satoshi Ōmura. Under this agreement, Kitasato and Shionogi-Nagasaki will collaborate on the research and development of the new antimalarial natural products discovered by Ōmura Satoshi Memorial Institute for the innovative antimalarial drugs.

Shionogi-Nagasaki has also reached the agreement for research collaboration with National Institute of Infectious Diseases, another leading infectious diseases research institute in Japan (Administrative office: Tokyo, Japan; Director-General: Takaji Wakita, M.D.,Ph.D.; hereafter “NIID”), for malaria research since March 2020. Under this collaboration, the NIID’s expertise and technology for malaria infection and its molecular mechanisms are merged with Shionogi-Nagasaki’s discovery research for novel antimalarial drugs and vaccines.

Malaria is one of the world’s three major infectious diseases along with AIDS and tuberculosis, and mainly occurs in tropical and subtropical regions. There are approximately more than 200 million malaria cases and 400 thousand deaths every year, and the mortalities are mostly concentrated in children under 52. Because the efficacy of the preventive vaccine is insufficient and the parasites have been developing resistance to the existing treatments, malaria has been a serious threat to mankind globally. The elimination of malaria has been targeted in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guideline for the international societies to achieve.

Shionogi is committed to “Protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases” as our materiality. Shionogi and Nagasaki University together accelerate the research for innovative antimalarial drugs and vaccines by fostering an open innovation platform that merges the strengths of diverse partners for malaria eradication. We will strive to contribute to the global health and sustainable society around the world.

The proportion of patients achieving at 100 (targeted PG ulcer healed) of the target pyoderma gangrenosum ulcer area reduction (PG Area Reduction: PGAR) at Week 26 of administration, which is the primary endpoint of this trial, was 54.5% (12 of 22 patients)1. The most common adverse drug reactions in patients receiving HUMIRA were skin bacterial infection1.

PG is an inflammatory skin disease that rapidly progresses after its onset and is classified into the following 5 types: ulcerative type, bullous type, pustular type, vegetative type, and a type that develops around a stoma2. In ulcerative PG, the most common type, appears as painful, pustules, papules and nodules in the lower extremities, especially in the lower legs, and efferently expands to form raised ulcer lesions with infiltration on the margins3. The ulceration accompanied by intense pain and is known to cause serious effects on patients’ quality of life (QOL)4. Although the pathogenic mechanism of PG is not fully understood, it is reported that approximately 20-30% of PG cases are caused by a slight injury or an external stimulus5. PG mostly affects people in their 50s to 70s, and its incidence is reported to be 3.0 per million/year in Japan6.

AbbVie and Eisai are committed to further contribute to the improvement of QOL of many more patients by making efforts to promote the appropriate use of HUMIRA, including its use for this indication, and to provide information on HUMIRA.

52942,AstraZeneca's Forxiga (dapagliflozin) Receives MHLW's Approval for Chronic Heart Failure,Forxiga approved in Japan for chronic heart failure,"The approval is based on a DAPA-HF trial assessing Forxiga (10mg, qd) + SOC vs PBO + SOC in 4,744 patients with HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%) with/ out T2D
 The study demonstrated reduced the risk of the composite outcome by 26% along with a reduction in the risk of CV death or worsening of HF events, including hospitalization for HF
 Additionally, Forxiga is currently being tested for HFpEF in the P-III DELIVER trial with data readout anticipated in the H2’21","30 November 2020 07:00 GMT
Forxiga is the first SGLT2 inhibitor approved in Japan for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in adult patients with and without type-2 diabetes
AstraZeneca’s Forxiga (dapagliflozin) has been approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) who are receiving standard of care.

HF is a life-threatening chronic disease that prevents the heart from pumping sufficient levels of blood around the body. It affects approximately 64 million people worldwide, at least half of whom have a reduced ejection fraction.1-3 This occurs when the left ventricle muscle is not able to contract adequately and therefore expels less oxygen-rich blood into the body.4-6

The approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) was based on positive results from the landmark DAPA-HF Phase III trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine.7

Masafumi Kitakaze, Director of Hanwa Daini Senboku Hospital, Guest Professor of the Graduate School of Medicine, University of Osaka and Investigator of the DAPA-HF Phase III trial in Japan, said: “Heart failure is a condition affecting 1.3 million people in Japan. Many patients have considerably reduced heart function, such as left ventricular reduced ejection fraction. Approximately half of patients will die within five years of diagnosis, which is worse than some cancers. With no known cure except for heart transplant, a new effective treatment option on top of the current standard of care may offer hope for people struggling with this disease and a new tool for cardiologists.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Forxiga’s efficacy in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or worsening of heart failure events could result in life-saving benefits for many heart failure patients in Japan. Today’s approval will shift the way we manage the disease by providing a treatment option that is urgently needed to improve outcomes and symptoms for these patients.”

Forxiga is the first sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to have shown a statistically significant reduction in the risk of the composite of cardiovascular (CV) death or worsening of HF events, including hospitalisation for HF (hHF). The DAPA-HF Phase III trial demonstrated that Forxiga, in addition to standard of care, reduced the risk of the composite outcome versus placebo by 26% and both components of the primary composite endpoint contributed benefit to the overall effect.

In the DAPA-HF Phase III trial, the safety profile of Forxiga was consistent with the well-established safety profile of the medicine. During the trial, one CV death or hHF or an urgent visit resulting in intravenous therapy associated with HF could be avoided for every 21 patients treated.

Forxiga (known as Farxiga in the US) is approved in the US, Europe, and several other countries around the world for the treatment of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Forxiga is advancing cardiorenal prevention as science continues to identify the underlying links between the heart, kidneys and pancreas. DAPA-HF is part of DapaCare, a robust clinical trial programme to assess the potential CV and renal benefits of Forxiga. The programme has also explored the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the ground-breaking DAPA-CKD Phase III trial. Additionally, Forxiga is currently being tested for HF patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the DELIVER Phase III trial with data readout anticipated in the second half of 2021.

In 2013, AstraZeneca K.K. (AZKK), a subsidiary in Japan of AstraZeneca, entered into an agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical for Forxiga. Based on this agreement, Ono is responsible for distribution and marketing of Forxiga tablets in Japan and has been co-promoting it with AZKK for the treatment of T2D and type-1 diabetes. Both companies will co-promote for the treatment of chronic heart failure.

Heart failure

HF affects approximately 64 million people worldwide (at least half of whom have a reduced ejection fraction), including 1.3 million in Japan, 15 million in the EU and six million in the US.2-3,8,9 It is a chronic disease where half of patients will die within five years of diagnosis.10 HFrEF and HFpEF are the two main categories of HF related to ejection fraction, a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving the heart each time it contracts.7 HFrEF occurs when the left ventricle muscle is not able to contract adequately and therefore, expels less oxygen-rich blood into the body.5,6 HF remains as fatal as some of the most common cancers in both men (prostate and bladder cancers) and women (breast cancer).11 It is the leading cause of hospitalisation for those over the age of 65 and represents a significant clinical and economic burden.12

DAPA-HF

DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure) is an international, multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised, double-blinded trial in 4,744 patients with HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%), with and without T2D, designed to evaluate the effect of Forxiga 10mg, compared with placebo, given once daily in addition to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint was time to the first occurrence of a worsening heart failure event (hospitalisation or equivalent event, i.e. an urgent heart failure visit), or CV death. The median duration of follow-up was 18.2 months.

Forxiga

Forxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction.

Forxiga has been evaluated in patients with CKD in the Phase III DAPA-CKD trial, with the full results announced in August 2020 demonstrating that Forxiga met all primary and secondary endpoints, providing overwhelming efficacy. Forxiga is currently being tested for patients with HF in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) Phase III trials. Forxiga will also be tested in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking registry-based randomised controlled trial. Forxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

AstraZeneca in CVRM

Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism (CVRM) together forms one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company. By following the science to understand more clearly the underlying links between the heart, kidneys and pancreas, AstraZeneca is investing in a portfolio of medicines to protect organs and improve outcomes by slowing disease progression, reducing risks and tackling comorbidities.

52963,Moderna to Seek the FDA and EMA's EUA for mRNA-1273 and Shows 100% Efficacy in P-III COVE-Study,Moderna Announces Primary Efficacy Analysis in Phase 3 COVE Study for Its COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate and Filing Today with U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization,"The P-III COVE study demonstrated 94.1% efficacy against COVID-19 and 100% efficacy against severe COVID-19. The vaccine was well tolerated with no serious safety concerns identified to date
 Moderna plans to submit an EUA to the FDA & an application for CMA with the EMA and to progress with the rolling reviews, which have already been initiated with international regulatory agencies
 The FDA has told Company to expect VRBPAC meeting for mRNA-1273 on Dec 17, 2020. The Company will submit data from the P-III COVE study to a peer-reviewed publication","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Nov. 30, 2020– Moderna, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced that the primary efficacy analysis of the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273 conducted on 196 cases confirms the high efficacy observed at the first interim analysis. The data analysis indicates a vaccine efficacy of 94.1%. Safety data continue to accrue and the study continues to be monitored by an independent, NIH-appointed Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The Company also announced that today, Moderna plans to request an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The Phase 3 study, known as the COVE study, enrolled more than 30,000 participants in the U.S. and is being conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 COVE study is based on the analysis of COVID-19 cases confirmed and adjudicated starting two weeks following the second dose of vaccine. Vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated at the first interim analysis with a total of 95 cases based on the pre-specified success criterion on efficacy. Today’s primary analysis was based on 196 cases, of which 185 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 11 cases observed in the mRNA-1273 group, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 94.1%. A secondary endpoint analyzed severe cases of COVID-19 and included 30 severe cases (as defined in the study protocol) in this analysis. All 30 cases occurred in the placebo group and none in the mRNA-1273 vaccinated group. There was one COVID-19-related death in the study to date, which occurred in the placebo group.

Efficacy was consistent across age, race and ethnicity, and gender demographics. The 196 COVID-19 cases included 33 older adults (ages 65+) and 42 participants identifying as being from diverse communities (including 29 Hispanic or LatinX, 6 Black or African Americans, 4 Asian Americans and 3 multiracial participants).

The safety profile of the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273 was previously described on November 16. A continuous review of safety data is ongoing and no new serious safety concerns have been identified by the Company. Based on prior analysis, the most common solicited adverse reactions included injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and erythema/redness at the injection site. Solicited adverse reactions increased in frequency and severity in the mRNA-1273 group after the second dose.

The Company will submit data from the Phase 3 COVE study to a peer-reviewed publication.

“This positive primary analysis confirms the ability of our vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease with 94.1% efficacy and importantly, the ability to prevent severe COVID-19 disease. We believe that our vaccine will provide a new and powerful tool that may change the course of this pandemic and help prevent severe disease, hospitalizations and death,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “I want to thank the thousands of participants in our Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, as well as the staff at clinical trial sites who have been on the front lines of the fight against the virus. I would again like to thank our partners at NIH, NIAID, BARDA and Operation Warp Speed who have helped us advance the clinical development of mRNA-1273. Finally, I want to thank the Moderna team and our suppliers and partners for their tireless work on the research, development and manufacturing of our vaccine. We will file today for an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA and continue forging ahead with the rolling reviews that have already been initiated with several regulatory agencies around the globe.”

Today, Moderna will submit for an EUA with the U.S. FDA and an application for Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) with the European Medicines Agency. The Company has already initiated the rolling review process with the EMA, Health Canada, SwissMedic, the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Ministry of Health in Israel, and Health Sciences Authority in Singapore and intends to seek Prequalification (PQ) and/or Emergency Use Listing (EUL) with the World Health Organization (WHO).

Additionally, Moderna announced that the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting to review the safety and efficacy data package for mRNA-1273 will likely be scheduled for Thursday, December 17. The Company expects that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will make a recommendation on immunization priorities. The Company anticipates that the shipping of mRNA-1273 to designated distribution points throughout the U.S. will occur shortly after an Emergency Use Authorization is granted.

Moderna is working with the U.S. CDC, Operation Warp Speed and McKesson (NYSE: MCK), a COVID-19 vaccine distributor contracted by the U.S. government, as well as global stakeholders to be prepared for distribution of mRNA-1273, in the event that it receives an EUA and similar global authorizations and approvals. By the end of 2020, the Company expects to have approximately 20 million doses of mRNA-1273 available in the U.S. The Company remains on track to manufacture 500 million to 1 billion doses globally in 2021. On November 10, the American Medical Association (AMA) issued a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code to report vaccination with mRNA-1273 (code: 91301). Moderna recently announced further progress towards ensuring the distribution, storage and handling of the vaccine can be done using existing infrastructure.

About the Phase 3 COVE Study

The Phase 3 COVE trial is a randomized, 1:1 placebo-controlled study testing mRNA-1273 at the 100 µg dose level in 30,000 participants in the U.S., ages 18 and older. The primary endpoint is the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease. Key secondary endpoints include prevention of severe COVID-19 disease and prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2. The trial will continue to accrue additional data relevant to safety and efficacy even after an EUA is submitted. The final estimates of vaccine efficacy for both primary and secondary endpoints will depend on the totality of data that will accumulate to inform the final analysis. Moderna worked closely with BARDA and the NIH, including NIAID’s COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN), to conduct the Phase 3 COVE study under Operation Warp Speed. Moderna’s partner PPD (Nasdaq: PPD), a leading global contract research organization providing comprehensive, integrated drug development, laboratory and lifecycle management services, has also been essential to the successful execution of the COVE study.

The Phase 3 COVE study was designed in collaboration with the FDA and NIH to evaluate Americans at risk of severe COVID-19 disease and completed enrollment of more than 30,000 participants ages 18 and older in the U.S. on October 22, including those at high risk of severe complications of COVID-19 disease. The COVE study includes more than 7,000 Americans over the age of 65. It also includes more than 5,000 Americans who are under the age of 65 but have high-risk chronic diseases that put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19, such as diabetes, severe obesity and cardiac disease. These medically high-risk groups represent 42% of the total participants in the Phase 3 COVE study. The study also included communities that have historically been under-represented in clinical research and have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The study includes more than 11,000 participants from communities of color, representing 37% of the study population, which is similar to the diversity of the U.S. at large. This includes more than 6,000 participants who identify as Hispanic or LatinX, and more than 3,000 participants who identify as Black or African American.

About mRNA-1273

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was co-developed by Moderna and investigators from NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to the NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing. On May 12, the FDA granted mRNA-1273 Fast Track designation. On May 29, the first participants in each age cohort: adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300) were dosed in the Phase 2 study of mRNA-1273. On July 8, the Phase 2 study completed enrollment.

Results from the second interim analysis of the NIH-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups were published on September 29 in The New England Journal of Medicine. On July 28, results from a non-human primate preclinical viral challenge study evaluating mRNA-1273 were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. On July 14, an interim analysis of the original cohorts in the NIH-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. mRNA-1273 currently is not approved for use by any regulatory body.

BARDA is supporting the continued research and development of mRNA-1273 with $955 million in federal funding under Contract no. 75A50120C00034. BARDA is reimbursing Moderna for 100 percent of the allowable costs incurred by the Company for conducting the program described in the BARDA contract. The U.S. government has agreed to provide up to $1.525 billion to purchase supply of mRNA-1273 under U.S. Department of Defense Contract No. W911QY-20-C-0100.

52968,Sanofi's Dupixent (dupilumab) Receives EC's Approval for Children with Severe Atopic Dermatitis,Dupixent® (dupilumab) approved by European Commission as first and only biologic medicine for children aged 6 to 11 years with severe atopic dermatitis,"The EC’s approval is based on a P-III study assessing Dupixent (300mg, q4w & 200mg, q2w) + TCS vas TCS alone in children aged 6-11yrs. with severe AD
 Result: improvement in disease extent and severity (82% & 80% vs 49% & 48%); at least 75% improvement (70% & 75% vs 17% & 26%); skin clearance (33% & 39% vs 11% & 10%); reduction in itching (51% & 61% vs 12% & 13%); improvement in HR-QoL (77% & 81% vs 39% & 36%) respectively
 Dupixent is mAb that inhibits the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13 proteins and is the only systemic medicine approved in the EU to treat children with severe AD","PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – November 30, 2020 – The European Commission (EC) has extended the marketing authorization for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to include children 6 to 11 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy. Dupixent is the only systemic medicine approved in the EU to treat these patients.

“As the parent of a child with atopic dermatitis, and someone who works with families impacted by this condition daily, I’ve seen first-hand the enormous physical and mental health burden of this disease, and the toll it can take on the entire family,” said Korey Capozza, MPH, Founder and Executive Director of Global Parents for Eczema Research (GPER). “Young children with severe atopic dermatitis currently have few treatment choices and significant unmet needs. We welcome the addition of new medicines for these underserved patients.”

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that can be debilitating, and severe disease can significantly impact many aspects of life for both children and their families. The current standard of care for children with severe atopic dermatitis in Europe is limited to topical treatments, leaving those with poorly controlled disease to cope with intense, unrelenting itch and skin lesions that can cover much of the body, resulting in skin cracking, redness or darkening, crusting and oozing. In addition, uncontrolled severe atopic dermatitis can have a substantial emotional and psychosocial impact, causing sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression and feelings of isolation in children.

 “The approval of Dupixent for children in Europe marks another significant milestone for atopic dermatitis patients and their families, broadening the availability of a first-in-class medicine that offers a proven safe and effective treatment for this debilitating skin disease,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “Dupixent’s ability to provide significantly clearer skin, and clinically meaningful reduction of persistent itch, addresses important unmet needs for these children. In addition to atopic dermatitis, we continue to investigate the potential of Dupixent in younger age groups and across a variety of type 2 inflammatory diseases.”

Dupixent is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) proteins, and is not an immunosuppressant. Data from Dupixent clinical trials have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).

“This approval for Dupixent in the EU represents a major advancement for children with severe atopic dermatitis and their families, who spend countless days and nights tending to their child’s disease with few treatment options to help alleviate the debilitating symptoms,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “Dupixent is a novel therapy that addresses a root cause of atopic dermatitis by specifically targeting the underlying type 2 inflammation of the disease. Dupixent has already been used by hundreds of thousands of patients around the world, including those with atopic dermatitis as well as other type 2 inflammatory diseases such as asthma and adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We are pleased to bring this paradigm-changing medicine to even younger patients in the EU who need new options beyond steroids or immunosuppressants.”

In children aged 6-11 years weighing 15 to <60 kg, Dupixent 300 mg is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) every four weeks following the initial loading dose given as two injections 14 days apart. For those weighing >60 kg, Dupixent 300 mg is administered every two weeks following the initial loading dose given the same day. The dose may be increased to 200 mg every two weeks in patients weighing 15 to <60 kg based on physician’s assessment.

Pivotal trial data

The EC decision is based primarily on data that includes pivotal Phase 3 efficacy and safety results of Dupixent combined with topical corticosteroids (TCS) compared to TCS alone (placebo) in children 6-11 years with severe atopic dermatitis. At 16 weeks, patients in treatment groups of Dupixent 300 mg every four weeks (N=122) or 200 mg every two weeks (N=59) with TCS experienced:

Improved disease extent and severity: 82% and 80% average improvement from baseline with Dupixent every four and two weeks, respectively, compared to 49% and 48% for placebo. In addition, 70% and 75% of Dupixent patients achieved at least a 75% improvement in the four-week and two-week treatment groups, respectively, compared to 17% and 26% for placebo.
Skin clearance: 33% and 39% of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin with Dupixent every four and two weeks respectively, compared to 11% and 10% for placebo.
Reduced itch: 51% and 61% of patients achieved clinically significant reduction with Dupixent every four and two weeks, respectively, compared to 12% and 13% for placebo. A significantly greater proportion of Dupixent patients achieved improvement in itch as early as four weeks.
Improved health-related quality of life (HR-QoL): 77% and 81% of patients experienced clinically meaningful improvement in patient-reported HR-QoLwith Dupixent every four and two weeks, respectively, compared to 39% and 36% for placebo. Dupixent patients also experienced improvements in additional HR-QoL measures assessing disease severity and patient-reported measures such as itch and sleep.
The safety profile of Dupixent in children 6-11 years of age followed through week 52, based on an open-label extension trial, was similar to the safety profile observed at week 16 and consistent with the safety profile seen in adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 65% and 61% for Dupixent every four and two weeks respectively, and 73% and 75% for placebo. AEs that were more commonly observed with Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infections (11% and 9% for Dupixent every four and two weeks, 10% and 12% for placebo), injection site reactions (10% and 14% for Dupixent every four and two weeks, 6% and 5% for placebo), nasopharyngitis (13% and 3% for Dupixent every four and two weeks, 7% and 10% for placebo), conjunctivitis (7% and 9% for Dupixent every four and two weeks, 4% and 5% for placebo), and fever (3% for both Dupixent groups, 2% and 0% for placebo). Additional prespecified AEs included skin infections (6% and 9% for Dupixent every four and two weeks, 13% for both placebo groups), and herpes viral infections (2% for both Dupixent groups, 5% for both placebo groups).

About the pediatric trial

The co-primary endpoints in the pediatric trial were skin clearance, as measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA), and disease extent and severity, as measured by Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI-75).

Secondary endpoints included the average change in EASI score from baseline, and itch as measured by at least a 4-point reduction in itch intensity on a 0 to 10-point scale (weekly average of daily Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale). Additionally, HR-QoL was measured by the proportion of patients who achieved at least six points on the patient-reported Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), as well as additional measures from Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) and SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD).

About Dupixent

Dupixent is approved for specific patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma and/or in adults with CRSwNP in a number of countries around the world, including the European Union, U.S. and Japan. Dupixent is currently approved in more than 60 countries, and more than 200,000 patients have been treated globally.

Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age, Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver. No initial lab testing or ongoing lab monitoring is required with Dupixent treatment in any approved indication or age group.

Dupilumab development program

To date, dupilumab has been studied in more than 10,000 patients across 50 clinical trials in various chronic diseases driven by type 2 inflammation.

In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation and other allergic pathways, including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), pediatric asthma (6 to 11 years of age, Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), and food and environmental allergies (Phase 2). These potential uses are investigational, and the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in these conditions have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.

 This is the first time that the global pharmaceutical has come together to launch an adaptive clinical trial","December 1, 2020 Thousand Oaks, CA
A range of therapeutics will be evaluated for their potential efficacy and safety relative to the condition severity of patients hospitalized with COVID-19
Trial sites are being established in hospitals around the world to support enrollment in communities where the virus is present
This is the first time that industry has come together to launch an adaptive clinical trial
Three members of the COVID R&D Alliance – Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN), Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (TSE: 4502/NYSE: TAK), and UCB (Euronext BR: UCB) – today announced the first patient enrolled in the COMMUNITY Trial (COVID-19 Multiple Agents and Modulators Unified Industry Members). COMMUNITY is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive platform trial that enables an array of therapeutic candidates to be studied in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

With worldwide COVID-19 deaths exceeding one million and a resurgence of cases globally, life science companies are working urgently to identify treatments that can potentially reduce clinical severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. COMMUNITY is the first platform trial designed and launched by members of the COVID R&D Alliance, a group of more than 20 leading pharmaceutical and biotech companies who are devoting significant time, insights and company resources to speed the development of potential therapies, novel antibodies, and anti-viral therapies for COVID-19 and its related symptoms.

“As this insidious virus rapidly spreads around the globe, doctors need options to treat hospitalized patients who are actively sick and experiencing a range of symptoms as the disease progresses,” said David M. Reese, M.D., Executive Vice President Research & Development, Amgen. “Working hand-in-hand with our peers, we hope to find options that could potentially save lives of the patients who will need treatments for COVID-19 before widespread availability of a vaccine.”

COMMUNITY uses an adaptive design which allows for the addition, removal and simultaneous study of multiple therapeutic candidates during the course of the trial. Multiple candidates will be tested against a shared placebo-controlled arm. The design allows for a streamlined approach which may accelerate execution of the study and save time as we search for therapeutics in the fight against the pandemic. Immunomodulating therapies will be the first candidates to enter COMMUNITY. Other therapies may join in the future, such as antivirals.

The trial’s design and global footprint were selected to address potential barriers in the study of COVID-19 therapeutics. This includes anticipating and activating trial sites to align with the rise and fall of COVID cases across geographic regions as well as streamlining an influx in trial-related inquiries faced by some hospitals and health systems. COMMUNITY will onboard global sites in the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and other countries. This geographic diversity will allow the trial sites to be active when cases spike locally. COMMUNITY aims to simplify the study of investigational therapies that may result in potential treatment options and address the needs of hospitals in treating patients.

“COVID is not confined to one country, making it imperative that we share the challenges, successes and insights in real-time” said Dhavalkumar Patel, Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, UCB. “By sharing our expertise and resources, we hope to arm care teams with promising investigational therapies to help patients who cannot wait.”

Uncontrolled vascular and immune inflammatory responses have proven to be hallmark symptoms in patients facing severe COVID-19 infections. These patients may face increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), stroke and death. Initial therapies entering into COMMUNITY were selected based upon their potential to suppress or control the immune response or the resulting inflammation. None of these therapies have been approved by the FDA, EMA, or other health authorities for the treatment of COVID-19 or its symptoms and are still investigational. These include:

Amgen’s OTEZLA®(apremilast), which may suppress immune response inflammation;
Takeda’s investigational intravenous administration of lanadelumab, which modulates the kallikrein-kinin system and suppresses production of bradykinin, potentially lessening inflammation;
UCB’s zilucoplan, an investigational medicine that may reduce overactivation of the immune system that contributes to ARDS.
OTEZLA entered COMMUNITY this week. It is expected lanadelumab and zilucoplan will enter in the coming weeks. Other anti-viral, immunomodulating and vascular agents may enter in the coming months.

COMMUNITY is studying hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This includes confirmed COVID-19 patients who may require either ongoing medical care, supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices, or invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). By enrolling both hospitalized Intensive Care Unit and non-Intensive Care Unit patients, the trial seeks to yield greater understanding of how therapeutic interventions may be used with hospitalized COVID-19 patients experiencing a range of symptoms.

 

About COMMUNITY
COMMUNITY is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled platform study designed to assess multiple candidates as a potential treatment for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). The focus of the trial is to identify an effective treatment(s) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, who are Grade 2 to Grade 5 on a Clinical Severity Status 8-Point Ordinal Scale.

The primary endpoint of COMMUNITY is time to confirmed clinical recovery without being re-hospitalized through Day 29 based on the clinical severity status scale, which is defined as achieving a score of 6, 7, or 8. Key secondary endpoints are oxygen-free recovery, improvement from baseline or fit for discharge from baseline, and all-cause mortality.

Patients will be randomized equally to either the candidate agent plus the standard of care or a placebo plus standard of care in a double-blind fashion. Patients who are randomized to placebo plus standard of care will be subsequently randomized equally to a matching placebo corresponding to an available agent.

 

About the COVID R&D Alliance
Organized in March 2020, the COVID R&D Alliance is operating unconstrained by past models of development and is accelerating the study candidates without regard to company affiliation. Members are sharing clinical trial data and real-world evidence, as well as crowd-sourcing early stage candidates to identify mechanisms and treatments that may be effective against COVID-19. Initial efforts by the group focus on advancing well understood therapies and late-stage investigational medicines for hospitalized patients who need treatment options. Activities are testing re-purposed molecules and early stage candidates. Member companies have 40 trials expected to have findings in the coming months.

Additional information on the COVID R&D Alliance is available at www.CovidRDAlliance.com.

 

About Otezla® (apremilast)
OTEZLA® (apremilast) is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which is thought to indirectly modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. The specific mechanism(s) by which OTEZLA exerts its therapeutic action in patients is not well defined.

Otezla is currently approved for use in more than 50 countries as an oral treatment for inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. By inhibiting PDE4, Otezla is thought to modulate the production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators, which may prove helpful in inhibiting the inflammatory response associated with the signs, symptoms and pulmonary involvements observed in some COVID-19 patients. Amgen plans to collaborate with platform trials to investigate Otezla in treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

 

Otezla® (apremilast) U.S. INDICATIONS

Otezla® (apremilast) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.

Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.

Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet’s Disease.

Contraindications

Otezla® (apremilast) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulation
Warnings and Precautions

Diarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting: Cases of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were associated with the use of Otezla. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases, patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting; advise patients to contact their healthcare provider. Consider Otezla dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting
Depression: Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with Otezla for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts/behavior, or in patients who develop such symptoms while on Otezla. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts, or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such changes occur
Psoriasis: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.3% (12/920) of patients reported depression compared to 0.4% (2/506) on placebo. Depression was reported as serious in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/506). Suicidal behavior was observed in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients on Otezla, compared to 0.2% (1/506) on placebo. One patient treated with Otezla attempted suicide; one patient on placebo committed suicide
Psoriatic Arthritis: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.0% (10/998) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 0.8% (4/495) treated with placebo. Suicidal ideation and behavior was observed in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients on Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients. Depression was reported as serious in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/495). Two patients who received placebo committed suicide compared to none on Otezla
Behcet’s Disease: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During the phase 3 clinical trial, 1% (1/104) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 1% (1/103) treated with placebo. No instances of suicidal ideation or behavior were reported in patients treated with Otezla or treated with placebo
Weight Decrease: Monitor body weight regularly; evaluate unexplained or clinically significant weight loss, and consider discontinuation of Otezla
Psoriasis: During clinical trials, body weight loss of 5-10% occurred in 12% (96/784) of patients treated with Otezla and in 5% (19/382) of patients treated with placebo. Body weight loss of ≥10% occurred in 2% (16/784) of patients treated with Otezla compared to 1% (3/382) of patients treated with placebo

About lanadelumab
Lanadelumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds and inhibits plasma kallikrein activity. Lanadelumab is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.

Based on its mechanism of action, lanadelumab may prevent the pro-inflammatory effects of SARS-COV2 and the extravasation and accumulation of fluid within the lungs during a serious and prolonged COVID-19 illness by decreasing plasma kallikrein activity and regulating excess bradykinin signaling. In addition, lanadelumab-induced plasma kallikrein inhibition may help to reduce inflammation and coagulation driven by FXII, which is activated by plasma kallikrein through a positive feedback loop. An investigational intravenous administration of lanadelumab is being studied.

Lanadelumab (marketed under the tradename TAKHZYRO®) is approved as a subcutaneous formulation for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients ≥12 years of age.

 The app is CE marked in EU as a Class 1 medical device and has been investigated in one pilot trial and is the subject of an ongoing randomized control trial in the EU
 The Kaia COPD solution consists of a mobile app and an interface for motivational support that aims to deliver a personalized pulmonary rehabilitation experience through education, daily training sessions, and stress relief exercises, boosted with human coaching support and individualized therapy","A new partnership
Kaia Health has entered into an exclusive partnership with global pharmaceutical company Chiesi Group to commercialize the Kaia Health Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Pulmonary Rehabilitation app in Europe. Under terms of the arrangement, the evidence-backed Kaia Health COPD digital therapeutic will be commercialized in key European markets in partnership with Chiesi Group.

The software-based Kaia Health COPD Pulmonary Rehabilitation program is accessed via an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet with an interface for motivational support that can be delivered by providers such as health coaches or healthcare professionals. The program provides a personalized, physical pulmonary-rehabilitation experience aimed at producing positive outcomes through behavioral changes.

“The Chiesi Group has a wealth of experience navigating the respiratory health landscape in Europe,” said Konstantin Mehl, Founder and President of Kaia Health. “Joining forces with Chiesi will expand patient access to evidence-based, digital physical pulmonary rehabilitation to help improve COPD patient care and quality of life.”

What is COPD?
COPD is a group of diseases that includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD causes airflow blockage and breathing-related problems stemming from lung inflammation and damaged lung tissue. COPD can severely limit daily activities and work productivity, and it negatively impacts quality of life, including social behavior and sleeping patterns, according to a recent study published in the European Journal of Health Economics.

COPD is the third leading cause of death in the world. An estimated 16 million Americans have COPD, and the condition is an enormous cost for the U.S. healthcare system, accounting for $32 billion per year in direct costs and $20.2 billion in indirect costs.

How the Kaia Health COPD app helps
Built on the Kaia Health chronic-disease digital-therapy platform, the Kaia Health COPD Pulmonary Rehabilitation app digitizes and delivers affordable, accessible, physical pulmonary rehabilitation—considered the gold standard in COPD—directly to patients’ homes on their smartphones.

“Our goal, both in Europe and the U.S., is to offer a solution that is patient-centric first, digital second,” said Stephan Huber, M.D., Kaia Health Chief Medical Officer. “As with our MSK Pain app, our COPD solution is a truly digitized version of key aspects of a physical rehabilitation therapy that aims to dramatically improve access to a proven behavioral intervention delivered in a scalable, patient-focused, digital format.”

Although COPD cannot be cured, quality of life can be improved with proper interventions. Pulmonary rehabilitation has been demonstrated to be highly effective at improving COPD patients’ health-related quality of life. It’s adoption is strongly encouraged by international guidelines, including guidelines from the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society. Despite its effectiveness, pulmonary rehabilitation suffers from underutilization due to lack of access to in-center rehabilitation programs, a problem that has been magnified by the global crisis of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Kaia Health COPD Pulmonary Rehabilitation app delivers comprehensive education and customized daily training sessions along with mindfulness and stress-relief exercises, augmented with human coaching support and individualized therapy. The Kaia COPD app has been investigated in one pilot trial and is currently the subject of an ongoing randomized controlled trial in Europe. The Kaia Health COPD Pulmonary Rehabilitation app is CE Marked in Europe as a Class 1 medical device.

52990,AstraZeneca Initiates P-IIb Study of ION449 (AZD8233) to Lower LDL-cholesterol,Ionis announces AstraZeneca’s initiation of the Phase 2b clinical study of its antisense medicine targeting PCSK9 to lower LDL-cholesterol,"The P-IIb study will evaluate three dose levels of ION449 (once a month, SC) vs PBO and will enroll ~108 patients aged 18-75yrs., who have LDL-C levels b/w 70-190 mg/dL and are receiving moderate/ high-intensity statin therapy
 The P-I study results demonstrated dose-dependent mean reductions in circulating plasma PCSK9 and LDL-C levels of >90% and ~70% respectively
 AstraZeneca granted $20M as a milestone to Ionis for the initiation of the P-II study. ION449 is antisense therapy designed to reduce blood cholesterol levels in patients with dyslipidemia by targeting PCSK9","CARLSBAD, Calif., Nov. 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IONS) today announced that the biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial of ION449 (AZD8233), an investigational antisense medicine designed to reduce blood cholesterol levels in patients with dyslipidemia by targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), an important regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). PCSK9 is an enzyme that controls the number of LDL receptors on the surface of cells. People with genetic variations that reduce PCSK9 function have lower LDL-C levels in the blood and a lower risk for major cardiovascular events. ION449 is a LIgand Conjugated Antisense (LICA) medicine being developed by AstraZeneca as part of a collaboration between Ionis and AstraZeneca.

The Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll approximately 108 participants, aged 18-75, who have LDL-C levels between 70 and 190 mg/dL and are receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy as defined by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines on blood cholesterol management. The primary objective is to assess the effect of different doses of ION449 on LDL-C compared to placebo at Week 12 in patients taking baseline statin therapy. The study will evaluate three dose levels of ION449 versus placebo, all administered once a month by subcutaneous injection. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated along with a number of secondary endpoints. Learn more about the trial at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04641299.

In a Phase 1 study reported at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions on November 13, single subcutaneous doses of ION449 (AZD8233) demonstrated dose-dependent mean reductions in circulating plasma PCSK9 and LDL-C levels of >90 percent and up to 70 percent, respectively, in subjects who had a baseline LDL-C between 100 and 190 mg/dL without concomitant statin therapy.1 Doses up to 120 mg were evaluated. ION449 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels.

“Results from the Phase 1 study showed that ION449 potently reduces PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol. ION449 demonstrated best-in-class potential for PCSK9 inhibition and LDL-C reduction, supporting larger clinical trials that are now underway to further evaluate efficacy and safety,” said Sotirios “Sam” Tsimikas, M.D., senior vice president, clinical development and cardiovascular franchise leader at Ionis. “The growing evidence supporting Ionis’ advanced LICA technology in cardiovascular disease holds promise for more effective approaches to lower LDL-C and to address cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide.”

Dr. Tsimikas will provide an update on Ionis’ cardiovascular programs during Ionis’ Virtual Investor Day, Dec. 7, 2020, beginning at 12 p.m. EST.

Ionis earned a milestone payment of $20 million from AstraZeneca for the Phase 2b clinical trial initiation of ION449. Ionis and AstraZeneca are collaborating on potential treatments for kidney disease, cardiometabolic disease and cancer.

 The collaboration will use Wren’s network kinetics drug discovery platform along with Eisai’s experience in drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders, to accelerate the development of clinical candidates
 The agreement focuses on developing a disease-modifying treatment for synucleinopathies based on network kinetics of α-synuclein misfolding and aggregation","TOKYO & CAMBRIDGE, England–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Wren Therapeutics Ltd. (Headquarters: Cambridge, UK, “Wren”) today announced that the companies have entered into an exclusive research collaboration agreement aiming to advance the discovery of novel small molecules that target α-synuclein for the potential treatment of synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.

Wren possesses a novel network kinetics drug discovery platform that precisely quantifies the effects of small molecules on the protein misfolding and aggregation pathway that causes neurodegenerative diseases. Wren’s approach to synucleinopathies is focused on identifying novel small molecules that selectively control the aggregation process of α-synuclein, which is associated with the onset and progression of these diseases. The collaboration will use Wren’s network kinetics drug discovery platform, alongside Eisai’s extensive experience in drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders, to accelerate the development of clinical candidates.

Dr. Samuel Cohen, Chief Executive Officer of Wren, commented: “We are delighted to have formed this collaboration with Eisai, a company with a distinguished track record and company-wide commitment to providing innovative treatments for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. We believe that by combining our unique, predictive and quantitatively driven platform with Eisai’s deep expertise in neurology, we can together advance highly differentiated small molecules targeting α-synuclein for the treatment of debilitating protein misfolding disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.”

Dr. Teiji Kimura, Vice President, Chief Discovery Officer of the Eisai Neurology Business Group, commented: “Synucleinopathies such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease represent a significant unmet medical need due to the lack of any effective disease-modifying treatments. The accumulation of α-synuclein oligomers with protein misfolding is an important hallmark of these diseases. The Wren team, with its world-renowned founding scientists, is pioneering a new and fundamentally different approach to addressing protein misfolding diseases. By integrating capabilities across both companies we expect this exciting collaboration to be uniquely successful in identifying novel disease-modifying therapeutics for patients suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s disease and related disorders.”

<Notes to editors>
About Wren’s novel network kinetics drug discovery platform
Wren’s proprietary network kinetics drug discovery platform enables an entirely new approach to drug discovery, designed specifically to address the unique challenges associated with protein misfolding diseases. The kinetics-based approach solves for the distinct molecular reaction network that underlies each misfolding disease and produces a fully predictive, quantitative map of the network and its dynamics. The platform identifies the optimum intervention points in the network to reduce the populations of toxic misfolded and aggregated species, and subsequently makes it possible to identify and optimise molecules with the desired kinetic inhibitory activity.

About Synucleinopathies
Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterised by the aberrant misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein in neurons and glial cells. Synucleinopathies include Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA).

53024,Genentech and Novartis's Xolair (omalizumab) Receives the FDA's Approval for Adults with Nasal Polyps,Novartis announces FDA approval of Xolair® (omalizumab) for adults with nasal polyps,"The approval is based on P-III POLYP 1 & 2 trials assessing Xolair vs PBO in 138 & 127 adult patients with nasal polyps who had an inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids respectively
 Results: @24wks. improvement in NPS (-1.1 vs 0.1 & -0.9 vs -0.3); improvement in NCS (-0.9 vs -0.4 & -0.7 vs -0.2); no new or unexpected safety signals were identified respectively
 Xolair is the first biologic for the treatment of nasal polyps that targets and blocks IgE. In the US, Novartis & Genentech work together to develop and co-promote Xolair","EAST HANOVER, N.J., Dec. 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Xolair® (omalizumab) for the add-on maintenance treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients 18 years of age and older with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids.1 Nasal polyps can lead to a loss of smell and nasal congestion, and frequently co-occur with other respiratory conditions, such as allergies and asthma. With this approval, Xolair is now the first biologic for the treatment of nasal polyps that targets and blocks immunoglobulin E (IgE), a key driver of inflammation.

“With Xolair, we observed significantly reduced nasal polyps and congestion symptoms in adults who had nasal polyps in two pivotal Phase III studies,” said Joseph Han, MD, Chief of the Division of Rhinology and the Division of Allergy at Eastern Virginia Medical School and study investigator of the POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 trials. “Xolair provides a new option for treating these patients, who often have other respiratory and allergic conditions that may further worsen symptoms.”

The FDA’s approval is based on results from the Phase III POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 trials. Both trials showed that adult patients with nasal polyps who had an inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids and received Xolair had statistically significant greater improvement from baseline at Week 24 in Nasal Polyp Score (NPS) and weekly average Nasal Congestion Score (NCS) than patients who received placebo.1 The greater improvements in NPS and NCS in the Xolair group compared to the placebo group were observed as early as the first assessment at Week 4 in both studies. All patients received background nasal mometasone therapy during both the treatment period and a five-week run-in period. In POLYP 1 and POLYP 2, the mean change from baseline at Week 24 for Xolair compared to placebo were: NPS, -1.1 vs 0.1 (95% CI: -1.6, -0.7) and -0.9 vs -0.3 (95% CI: -1.1, -0.1); NCS, -0.9 vs -0.4 (95%CI: -0.8, -0.3) and -0.7 vs -0.2 (95% CI: -0.8, -0.2).1 POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 are the ninth and tenth Phase III trials for Xolair, respectively. Results from POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 were recently published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

“This approval is welcome news for people with nasal polyps and adds to the legacy of Xolair for treating multiple debilitating IgE-mediated conditions,” said Victor Bultó, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. “The additional indication is an important step on our path to realizing the full potential of Xolair across allergic, respiratory and inflammatory conditions and associated comorbidities.”

No new or unexpected safety signals were identified in patients treated with Xolair, with over 95% of patients completing each safety arm of POLYP 1 and POLYP 2. 2 The most common adverse reactions (≥3% of patients) included headache, injection site reaction, arthralgia, upper abdominal pain and dizziness. The safety profile in POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 was consistent with the established safety profile for Xolair.

“Adults living with nasal polyps may not be able to breathe through their nose and smell normally, and currently have limited treatment options,” said Tonya Winders, President and CEO, Allergy & Asthma Network. “The approval of Xolair is welcome news for the community, providing another option to treat patients and help alleviate their symptoms.”

Xolair is an injectable biologic medicine that is also FDA-approved for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma in people 6 years of age or older whose asthma symptoms are not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, and for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in people 12 years of age and older who continue to have hives that are not controlled by H1 antihistamines. Approximately 460,000 patients have been treated in the US with Xolair since its initial approval for allergic asthma in 2003.3 In the US, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Genentech work together to develop and co-promote Xolair.

About Nasal Polyps
Nasal polyps is a commonly occurring and potentially debilitating condition in adults, impacting 13 million people in the US.4,5 Currently, there are limited treatment options available and many patients opt for nasal surgery or systemic steroids. However, polyps may regrow over time. Nasal polyps present as noncancerous lesions on the lining of the nasal sinuses or nasal cavity associated with irritation and inflammation, which can block normal airflow.6 Nasal polyps may co-occur with other respiratory conditions, such as allergies and asthma.

About POLYP 1 and POLYP 2
POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 are replicate Phase III pivotal studies designed to determine the efficacy and safety of Xolair compared with placebo in adult patients with nasal polyps who had an inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids. Both trials were randomized, multicenter, double-blind and placebo-controlled. POLYP 1 involved 138 patients, and POLYP 2 involved 127 patients. The co-primary outcomes for both trials were change from baseline to Week 24 in average daily Nasal Congestion Score and Nasal Polyp Score. Patients in the studies were administered either Xolair or placebo by subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks in addition to background nasal mometasone therapy during both the treatment period and a five-week run-in period.1

About Xolair® (omalizumab)
Xolair (omalizumab) is the only approved antibody designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE). By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimizes the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade.

An injectable prescription medicine, Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma in more than 90 countries, including the US since 2003 and the EU since 2005. Xolair is approved for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in over 80 countries including the European Union and for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), as it is known in the US and Canada. Xolair has over one million patient years of exposure. In addition, a liquid formulation of Xolair in prefilled syringes has been approved in the US, EU and more than 10 countries outside of the EU, including Canada and Australia. The self-administration indication for Xolair in prefilled syringes was also approved in the EU in 2018. Outside the US, Novartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs.

Xolair US Indications
XOLAIR® (omalizumab) for subcutaneous use is an injectable prescription medicine used to treat:

moderate to severe persistent asthma in people 6 years of age and older whose asthma symptoms are not controlled with their current asthma medicines. A skin or blood test is performed to see if people have allergies to year-round allergens.
nasal polyps in people 18 years of age and older when medicines to treat nasal polyps called nasal corticosteroids have not worked well enough. It is not known if XOLAIR is safe and effective in people with nasal polyps under 18 years of age.
chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU, chronic hives without a known cause) in people 12 years of age and older who continue to have hives that are not controlled with their current CIU medicines.
Xolair is not used to treat other allergic conditions, other forms of hives, or sudden breathing problems.

Important Safety Information

What is the most important information patients should know about XOLAIR?
Severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis can happen when patients receive XOLAIR. The reaction can occur after the first dose, or after many doses. It may also occur right after a XOLAIR injection or days later. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition and can lead to death. Patients should go to the nearest emergency room right away if they have any of these symptoms of an allergic reaction:

wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, or trouble breathing
low blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, rapid or weak heartbeat, anxiety, or feeling of “impending doom”
flushing, itching, hives, or feeling warm
swelling of the throat or tongue, throat tightness, hoarse voice, or trouble swallowing
A healthcare provider will monitor patients closely for symptoms of an allergic reaction while they are receiving XOLAIR and for a period of time after the injection. A healthcare provider should talk to patients about getting medical treatment if they have symptoms of an allergic reaction after leaving the healthcare provider’s office or treatment center.

Patients should not receive XOLAIR if they are allergic to omalizumab or any of the ingredients in XOLAIR.

Before receiving XOLAIR, patients should tell their healthcare provider about all of their medical conditions, including if they:

have a latex allergy or any other allergies (such as food allergy or seasonal allergies). The needle cap on the XOLAIR prefilled syringe may contain latex
have sudden breathing problems (bronchospasm)
have ever had a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis
have or have had a parasitic infection
have or have had cancer
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if XOLAIR may harm an unborn baby.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if XOLAIR passes into breast milk. Patients should talk with their healthcare provider about the best way to feed a baby while they receive XOLAIR.
Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements.

How should patients receive XOLAIR?

XOLAIR should be given by a healthcare provider, in a healthcare setting.
XOLAIR is given in 1 or more injections under the skin (subcutaneous), 1 time every 2 or 4 weeks.
In people with asthma and nasal polyps, a blood test for a substance called IgE must be performed prior to starting XOLAIR to determine the appropriate dose and dosing frequency.
In people with chronic hives, a blood test is not necessary to determine the dose or dosing frequency.
Patients should not decrease or stop taking any of their other asthma, nasal polyps, or hive medicine unless their healthcare providers tell them to.
Patients may not see improvement in their symptoms right away after XOLAIR treatment.
What are the possible side effects of XOLAIR?

XOLAIR may cause serious side effects, including:

See, “What is the most important information I should know about XOLAIR” regarding the risk of anaphylaxis.
Cancer. Cases of cancer were observed in some people who received XOLAIR.
Inflammation of the blood vessels. Rarely, this can happen in people with asthma who receive XOLAIR. This usually, but not always, happens in people who also take a steroid medicine by mouth that is being stopped or the dose is being lowered. It is not known whether this is caused by XOLAIR. Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have rash; chest pain; shortness of breath; or a feeling of pins and needles or numbness of their arms or legs.
Fever, muscle aches, and rash. Some people who take XOLAIR get these symptoms 1 to 5 days after receiving a XOLAIR injection. If patients have any of these symptoms, they should tell their healthcare provider.
Parasitic infection. Some people who are at a high risk for parasite (worm) infections, get a parasite infection after receiving XOLAIR. A healthcare provider can test stool to check if patients have a parasite infection.
Heart and circulation problems. Some people who receive XOLAIR have had chest pain, heart attack, blood clots in the lungs or legs, or temporary symptoms of weakness on one side of the body, slurred speech, or altered vision. It is not known whether this is caused by XOLAIR.
The most common side effects of XOLAIR:

In adults and children 12 years of age and older with asthma: pain especially in the arms and legs, dizziness, feeling tired, skin rash, bone fractures, and pain or discomfort of the ears.
In children 6 to less than 12 years of age with asthma: common cold symptoms, headache, fever, sore throat, pain or discomfort of the ear, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and nose bleeds.
In adults with nasal polyps: headache, injection site reactions, joint pain, upper abdominal pain, and dizziness. 
In people with chronic idiopathic urticaria: nausea, headaches, swelling of the inside of the nose, throat or sinuses, cough, joint pain, and upper respiratory tract infection.
These are not all the possible side effects of XOLAIR. Patients should call their doctor for medical advice about side effects.

Patients may report side effects to the FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Patients may also report side effects to Genentech at (888) 835-2555 or Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at (888) 669-6682.

53032,BioNTech and Pfizer Report CMA Submission of BNT162b2 to EMA for COVID-19,Pfizer and BioNTech Submitted Application for Conditional Marketing Authorization for COVID-19 Vaccine to the EMA,"The companies have submitted CMA to the EMA for BNT162b2, against COVID-19. The submission completes the rolling review process initiated on Oct 6, 2020
 The submitted data showed a 95% efficacy rate, efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race, and ethnicity demographics, with an observed efficacy in adults aged ≥65yrs. of >94%, favorable tolerability with no safety concerns
 In addition to submission to EMA, FDA & MHRA, the companies have also initiated additional rolling submissions across the globe including in Australia, Canada, and Japan, and plan to submit applications to other regulatory agencies globally","NEW YORK and MAINZ, GERMANY, December 1, 2020 — Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) have submitted on Monday, November 30, 2020, a formal Application for Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for their mRNA vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, against COVID-19. This submission completes the rolling review process initiated on October 6, 2020, with nonclinical data and partial Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) data, followed by emerging clinical data submitted by Pfizer and BioNTech. If EMA concludes that the benefits of the vaccine candidate outweigh its risks in protecting against COVID‑19, it will recommend granting a CMA that could potentially enable use of BNT162b2 in Europe before the end of 2020.

The submitted clinical data demonstrated a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% (p<0.0001) in the companies’ Phase 3 clinical study in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and also in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from 7 days after the second dose. Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics, with an observed efficacy in adults age 65 and over of more than 94%. The first primary objective analysis was based on 170 confirmed cases of COVID-19. In the trial, BNT162b2 also showed an overall favorable tolerability with no safety concerns reported by the Data Monitoring Committee to date. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants in the Phase 3 study have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds, and 41% of global and 45% of U.S. participants are 56-85 years of age.

“Today’s announcement marks another key milestone in our efforts to fulfill our promise to do everything we can to address this dire crisis given the critical public health need,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO. “We have known since the beginning of this journey that patients are waiting, and we stand ready to ship COVID-19 vaccine doses as soon as potential authorizations will allow us.”

“As a company located in the heart of Europe, today’s milestone is important to us as we continue to seek to enable a worldwide supply upon potential approval of BNT162b2,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “We will continue to work with regulatory agencies around the world to enable the rapid distribution, should the vaccine receive the approval, contributing to the joint efforts to let the world heal and regain its normal pace of life.”

The vaccine candidate will be assessed according to EMA’s normal stringent standards for quality, safety and efficacy. The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate is currently not approved for distribution anywhere in the world.

In addition to submission to EMA, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the companies have initiated rolling submissions across the globe including in Australia, Canada and Japan, and plan to submit applications to other regulatory agencies around the world.

 The collaboration b/w Wilson and Penn’s GTP and Regeneron will have two phases. The first phase will include the validation of the effectiveness of Abs delivered via AAV in a large animal model challenge study. If successful, the research team will complete studies to support the filing of IND to the FDA
 Regeneron’s Ab cocktail (casirivimab & imdevimab) is studied in clinical trials for the prevention of COVID-19 and has received the US FDA’s EUA in certain high-risk patients with mild to mod. COVID-19","PHILADELPHIA—A new University of Pennsylvania (Penn) research collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will investigate whether Regeneron’s casirivimab and imdevimab investigational antibody cocktail can prevent COVID-19 infection when delivered intranasally via Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vectors. Regeneron’s antibody cocktail (casirivimab and imdevimab administered together) is being studied in clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and was recently granted an Emergency Use Authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in certain high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

Gene therapy pioneer James Wilson, MD, PhD, professor of Medicine and director of the Gene Therapy Program and the Orphan Disease Center at Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine, and his team will work with Regeneron to study the safety and effectiveness of using AAV vectors to introduce the sequence of the cocktail’s virus-neutralizing antibodies directly to nasal epithelial cells. This new collaboration will introduce the application of AAVs, which have traditionally been used for gene therapies against deadly genetic diseases, to the fight against a virus that has infected more than 50 million people across the globe and taken the lives of 1.25 million to date.

“The fight against COVID-19 requires the most creative approaches for the prevention, testing, and treatment of this disease,” Wilson said. “Early clinical data from Regeneron show that their investigational antibody combination may play a role in helping treat the disease and reduce severity in those who are infected. We hope to leverage the virus-neutralizing ability of this antibody cocktail for prevention of COVID-19 using a novel delivery mechanism, as well.

“The advantage of AAV in this application is that can achieve sustained expression of the antibodies in the nasal mucosa, which is the site of infection, following a single administration,” he said. “In contrast to traditional vaccines, AAV delivery of antibodies provides a rapid onset of response and no reliance on the need for the recipient to mount an immune system response over time. This latter feature may be particularly attractive in people with weakened immune systems, like the elderly, or people who need rapid protection, like frontline healthcare workers.”

One of Wilson’s major goals throughout his career has been to develop new methods for delivering genes to cells. He led his lab at the GTP to discover the AAV family of viruses, found in primate tissues, that can be engineered to ferry healthy DNA into the correct cells. AAV vectors — the most commonly used viral vectors today — were developed by Wilson’s laboratory at Penn largely to treat rare and orphan diseases. In 2019, the Wilson lab celebrated the FDA approval of Zolgensma, the first approved drug for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. The early development of this drug was enabled by the discovery of an AAV isolate in Wilson’s lab. In the biopharma industry, at least 90 preclinical programs and 40 clinical programs use Wilson’s AAV vectors.

“Regeneron scientists specifically selected casirivimab and imdevimab to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and we have been encouraged by the promising clinical data thus far,” said Christos Kyratsous, PhD, Vice President of Research, Infectious Diseases and Viral Vector Technologies at Regeneron. “In the quest to use cutting-edge science to help end this disruptive and often very devastating disease, we are excited to explore alternate delivery mechanisms such as AAV that may extend the potential benefits of this investigational therapy to even more people around the world.”

To date, AAV has been shown to be a particularly durable method of introducing antibodies into the body, because the AAV genome that codes for the therapeutic antibody remains stable in the nucleus of transduced cells. In clinical trials thus far, casirivimab and imdevimab are delivered together by intravenous or subcutaneous injection, with data showing antibody levels lasting a month or more. Based on data from Regeneron’s preclinical studies showing that the antibody cocktail can prevent infection in animal models, Wilson’s team is hopeful that introducing the therapy via single dose of AAV will be able to produce similar protection for potentially a longer duration.

To develop their investigational antibody cocktail, Regeneron scientists selected two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein, as detailed in Science.

The casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail is an investigational therapy that has not been fully evaluated by the FDA and is not yet known to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19. It is being studied in four ongoing late-stage clinical trials: two Phase 2/3 trials for the treatment of certain hospitalized and non-hospitalized (“ambulatory”) COVID-19 patients, the open-label, Phase 3 RECOVERY trial of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the UK, and a Phase 3 trial for the prevention of COVID-19 in uninfected people who are at high-risk of exposure to a COVID-19 patient (such as the patient’s housemate). Regeneron recently announced positive results from an ongoing Phase 2/3 trial of the medicine in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, showing significant impact on viral load and patient medical visits, like hospitalization or medical office visits.

The collaboration between Wilson and Penn’s GTP and Regeneron will have two phases. The first phase will include the validation of the effectiveness of the antibodies delivered via AAV in a large animal model challenge study, where animals will be given the antibody cocktail via AAV and exposed to the novel coronavirus. If that study is successful, the research team will complete studies to support filing of an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA, which is a necessary step before clinical trials in humans can begin.

Editor’s note: The University of Pennsylvania and James Wilson may benefit from licensing any intellectual property related to any inventions produced. Penn is also receiving support from Regeneron to conduct this work in the Wilson lab and Gene Therapy Program.

The deal is expected to be closed in Q1’21
 The payments will be made in two tranches: $320M will be paid upon transaction closing and $30M as additional milestones
 Crestor is a statin, a lipid-lowering agent used to treat blood-lipid disorders & to prevent CV events, such as heart attacks & strokes, and is approved as a lipid-regulating medicine in 100+ countries","AACHEN, Germany, Dec. 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Grünenthal, a global science-based, privately-owned pharmaceutical company, today announced that it has agreed to acquire the European rights (excluding Spain and the UK) to CRESTOR™ (rosuvastatin) and its associated brands for a total consideration of up to US$ 350 million. CRESTOR™ is among the leading statin products in Europe and is indicated for the treatment of dyslipidaemia, hypercholesterolaemia and the prevention of cardiovascular events. Compared to other statins such as atorvastatin, CRESTOR™ has demonstrated superior LDL- cholesterol- lowering efficacy.[1] The level of LDL is an important factor for the improvement of cardiovascular outcomes and therefore especially important in patients with high risk of cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes or stroke.

“Cardiovascular diseases are among the most burdensome diseases in Europe[2] and we are excited to include such a well-established product in our portfolio”, said Gabriel Baertschi, Grünenthal CEO.
“The acquisition of European rights to CRESTORTM is yet another proof of our strategy aiming at strengthening Grünenthal’s financial performance and bringing strong brands to patients across our markets.”

Under the terms of this agreement, Grünenthal will acquire the exclusive rights to market CRESTORTM and its second brands in more than 30 European markets. Grünenthal will also take over bulk production and packaging for the defined markets by 2025. CRESTORTM continues to generate significant revenues despite having lost exclusivity. Total CRESTORTM 2019 sales in the countries where rights were acquired were US$ 136 million (€ 122 million).

This acquisition is expected to generate a significant profit contribution in the upcoming years, supporting Grünenthal’s strategy aiming at concluding profit accretive deals that strengthen the company’s financial performance. The acquisition is subject to approval from the relevant antitrust authorities, with closing expected in the first quarter of 2021.

The acquisition of CRESTOR™ is part of a series of acquisitions and partnerships Grünenthal has entered into in the last few years, including European rights to Nexium™, the global (ex US and Japan) rights to Vimovo™, global rights to Qutenza™, and global (ex Japan) rights to Zomig™. The company has signed deals with a total value of more than US$ 1.7 billion since 2016. Recently, the company announced the FDA label-extension approval of Qutenza™ for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the feet. Grünenthal aims to further strengthen its research and innovation capabilities in pain and to explore commercial growth opportunities in its core markets, specifically Europe, the US and Latin America.

53053,"The US FDA Approves Pfizer's Oncology Supportive Care Biosimilar Nyvepria (biosimilar, pegfilgrastim)","Pfizer Receives European Approval for Oncology Supportive Care Biosimilar, NYVEPRIATM (pegfilgrastim)","The EC has approved Nyvepria, a biosimilar referencing Neulasta to reduce the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic CT for malignancy
 The EC approval is based data demonstrating a high degree of similarity of Nyvepria to its reference product
 Pfizer plans to make Nyvepria available to patients in multiple EU countries starting in Q1’21. The EC’s approval follows the US FDA’s approval granted in Jun’2020","New York, NY, November 20, 2020 – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved NYVEPRIA™ (pegfilgrastim), a biosimilar to Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), to reduce the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes).1,2 Febrile neutropenia is a common side effect of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, which can leave patients vulnerable
to infections.3
“The development of febrile neutropenia in people living with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy can be a very serious complication,” said Paul Cornes, MD, oncologist and member of the continuing medical education program of the European Association of Hospital Pharmacists and core lecturer for the European School of Oncology. “The EC approval of NYVEPRIA provides clinicians with an alternative long-acting option that can help prevent infections.”
The EC approval is based on a comprehensive data package and totality of evidence demonstrating a high degree of similarity of NYVEPRIA to its reference product.
With more than 10 years of global in-market experience and a portfolio of nine biosimilar products which have received regulatory approval, Pfizer is proud to be a global leader of this vital healthcare segment. NYVEPRIA is Pfizer’s sixth approved oncology biosimilar and third approved supportive care biosimilar in Europe.
“Today’s approval of NYVEPRIA reflects Pfizer’s commitment to biosimilar medicines, which can generate savings for healthcare systems and increase patient access to important treatment options,” said Masum Hossain, Regional President, Oncology, International Developed Markets at Pfizer. “We are excited by the promise that treatments like NYVEPRIA can offer to the European healthcare system by driving market competition that can help lower the cost of care.”

Pfizer intends to make NYVEPRIA available to patients in several European countries starting in Q1 2021.

European Marketing Authorization of NYVEPRIA follows the medicine’s approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June 2020. In the U.S., NYVEPRIA (pegfilgrastim-apgf) is approved to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. 4

About NYVEPRIA (pegfilgrastim biosimilar)
NYVEPRIA, a biosimilar to Neulasta, is approved by the EMA to reduce the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes).1 This condition, known as febrile neutropenia, is a common side effect of many types of chemotherapy and lowers the body’s ability to defend itself against infections.3

NYVEPRIA safety information

Do not use NYVEPRIA if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim,or any of the other ingredients of this medicine.
Before starting treatment with NYVEPRIA, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if:
• you have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), inflammation of the lungs(interstitial lung disease), or an abnormal chest x ray (lung infiltration).
• you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anemia) or decreased blood platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), which reduces the ability of your blood to clot. Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely.
• you have sickle cell anemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more.
• you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby.
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Tell your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following side effects while taking NYVEPRIA:
• swelling or puffiness.
• passing urine less frequently.
• difficulty breathing.
• abdominal (belly) swelling and feeling of fullness.
• a general feeling of tiredness.
These symptoms generally develop quickly and could signify an uncommon condition called capillary leak syndrome, which causes blood to leak from small blood vessels into your body and requires urgent treatment.

While taking NYVEPRIA, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if:
• you get an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash or hives on the skin and areas of the skin that itch.
• you get a cough or fever, and have difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
• you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a problem with your spleen (splenomegaly).
• you get fever, abdominal pain, malaise, and back pain as these may be symptoms of inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body). This disorder can occur rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors.
• you become pregnant.

Other very common side effects of NYVEPRIA treatment include:
• bone pain or general aches and pains in the joints and muscles.
• feeling sick (nausea) and headaches.
• pain at the site of injection.
• chest pain not related to heart disorders.
• some changes may occur in your blood, but these will be detectedby routine blood tests. Your white blood cell count may become high for a short period. Your platelet count may become low which might result in bruising.

Skin reactions

Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome; a skin condition that causes painful blisters and sores of the skin and mucous membranes, especially in the mouth) have been reported with the use of pegfilgrastim. Stop using NYVEPRIA and get medical attention immediately if you notice any of these symptoms: reddish target like
or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes possibly with fever and flu-like symptoms beforehand.

Blood cancer

You should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. If you have a cancer of the blood or have been told by your doctor that you are at risk of one, you should not use NYVEPRIA, unless instructed by your doctor.

Like all medicines, NYVEPRIA can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most side effects are mild to moderate, but some may be serious and require treatment. Your doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as NYVEPRIA can damage your kidneys (glomerulonephritis).
Please refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for NYVEPRIA for complete safety information.

“We are proud to partner with Blueprint Medicines to bring this important new option to people with certain types of RET-altered thyroid cancer,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Gavreto is now approved across multiple RET-altered tumour types, underscoring our commitment to advancing personalised healthcare with treatments that target the underlying biology of each person’s cancer.”

Approximately 10-20% of people with papillary thyroid cancer (the most common type of thyroid cancer)1 have RET fusion-positive tumours,2 and roughly 90% of people with advanced MTC (a rare form of thyroid cancer) carry RET mutations.3 Biomarker testing for RET fusions and mutations can help identify people who are eligible for treatment with Gavreto.

The approvals are based on results from the phase I/II ARROW study, which demonstrated durable clinical activity in people with or without prior therapy and regardless of RET alteration genotypes.4 Treatment with Gavreto led to an overall response rate (ORR) of 60% (95% CI: 46%, 73%) in 55 people with RET-mutant metastatic MTC previously treated with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib, and the median duration of response (DoR) was not reached (95% CI: 15.1 months, not estimable).2 In 29 people with cabozantinib- and vandetanib-naïve RET-mutant advanced MTC who were determined to be not eligible for standard therapies, the ORR was 66% (95% CI: 46%, 82%), and the median DoR was not reached (95% CI: not estimable, not estimable).4 In nine people with RET fusion-positive metastatic thyroid cancer, Gavreto demonstrated an ORR of 89% (95% CI: 52%, 100%), and the median DoR was not reached (95% CI: not estimable, not estimable).4 In ARROW trial patients across RET-altered tumour types, the most common adverse reactions (≥25%) were constipation, increased blood pressure (hypertension), fatigue, musculoskeletal pain and diarrhoea.4

The FDA reviewed and approved the application under its Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot programme, which aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. In September, the FDA also granted accelerated approval to Gavreto for the treatment of adults with metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an FDA approved test. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. In addition, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Gavreto for the treatment of RET mutation-positive MTC that requires systemic treatment and for which there are no acceptable alternative treatments and for RET fusion-positive NSCLC that has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy.

Gavreto is a once-daily, oral precision therapy designed to selectively target RET alterations, including fusions and mutations.

About the ARROW study5
ARROW (NCT03037385) is a phase I/II, open-label, first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Gavreto, administered orally in people with rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer and other RET-altered solid tumours. The trial consists of two parts: a dose escalation portion, which is complete, and an expansion portion in people treated with 400 mg of Gavreto, once-daily. ARROW is being conducted at multiple sites across the United States, European Union and Asia.

About RET-altered cancers
RET gene alterations, such as fusions and mutations, are key disease drivers in many types of cancer, including NSCLC and several types of thyroid cancers. Approximately 10-20% of people with papillary thyroid cancer (the most common type of thyroid cancer)1 have RET fusion-positive tumours,2 and roughly 90% of people with advanced MTC (a rare form of thyroid cancer) carry RET mutations.3 In NSCLC, RET fusions represent approximately 1-2% of patients.6 Oncogenic RET fusions also are observed at low frequencies in cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal, neuroendocrine, ovarian, pancreatic and thymus cancers.

About Gavreto
Gavreto is a once-daily, oral precision therapy designed to selectively target RET alterations, including fusions and mutations, regardless of the tissue of origin. Preclinical data have shown that Gavreto inhibits primary RET fusions and mutations that cause cancer in subsets of patients, as well as secondary RET mutations predicted to drive resistance to treatment. Blueprint Medicines and Roche are co-developing Gavreto for the treatment of patients with various types of RET-altered cancers.

Blueprint Medicines and Roche are co-developing Gavreto globally, excluding Greater China.* Blueprint Medicines and Genentech, a wholly owned member of the Roche Group, will co-commercialise Gavreto in the US and Roche has exclusive commercialisation rights for Gavreto outside of the US, excluding Greater China.*

 The ustekinumab is mAb targeting the cytokines IL-12 & IL-23. Stelara is used to treat various severe inflammatory conditions such as mod. to sev. psoriasis, CD & for UC","Munich – Formycon AG (ISIN: DE000A1EWVY8/ WKN: A1EWVY) and Bioeq GmbH announced the dosage of the first patient in the Phase III clinical trial (first-patient-in). The aim of the randomized, double-blind, multi-center Phase III study is to demonstrate the comparability of FYB202 and the reference product Stelara(R) in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris. This is the most common form of psoriasis, accounting for 80 to 90 percent of its occurrence, and is also known as plaque psoriasis. Due to this systemic disease affecting the entire body or organism, affected patients also have an increased risk of developing psoriatic arthritis and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.

The active ingredient ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the cytokines interleukin-12 and interleukin-23. Since 2009, Stelara(R) has been used to treat various severe inflammatory conditions such as moderate to severe psoriasis. In 2016, its indications were expanded to treat Crohn’s disease and in 2019 it was also approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Both of these conditions are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The drug is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis. In 2019, the reference market for Stelara(R) was over USD 6 billion worldwide.

FYB202 is being developed as part of a joint venture between Aristo Pharma GmbH and Formycon AG, as well as in cooperation with bioeq GmbH. Bioeq is responsible for the clinical studies which were developed in close cooperation with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European regulatory authority (EMA).

Formycon’s COO Dr. Stefan Glombitza is pleased: “With the start of what is now our third clinical Phase III study, we have reached another milestone in the development of our (late-stage) biosimilar candidates. With FYB202 we have a promising biosimilar candidate and are addressing an important and growing market in the inflammatory diseases segment. We would also like to thank our partners for their constructive cooperation and look forward to further joint steps towards the approval of our high-quality Stelara(R) biosimilar.”

Working with various partners, Bioeq develops third-wave biosimilars and specializes in ophthalmic agents. The development programs meet the standards for highly regulated markets such as Europe, the USA, Canada, or Japan, and are therefore suitable for global licensing. Bioeq’s expertise lies primarily in comprehensive project management, clinical development, the drafting of licensing strategies in dialog with the authorities, the development of application systems for administering the products, the drawing-up of patent strategies, and in license management. Bioeq is currently working on five different biosimilar projects.

About Biosimilars:
Since their introduction in the 1980s, biopharmaceuticals have revolutionized the treatment of serious diseases such as cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and eye diseases. In the coming years, many of these biotech drugs will lose their patent protection – and by 2020, medications with revenues of approximately USD 100 billion will be off patent. Biosimilars are follow-on versions of biopharmaceuticals, for which exclusivity has expired. They are approved via stringent regulatory pathways in highly regulated markets (such as EU, US, Japan, Canada, Australia) based on proven similarity of the biosimilar with the originator biopharmaceutical reference product. In 2019, global sales of biosimilars exceeded USD12 billion. Analysts estimate that this figure could rise to around USD 69 billion by 2025.

“The 52-week data confirms SB11 has equivalence in efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) as well as a comparable safety and immunogenicity profile with the reference product,” said Hee Kyung Kim, Senior Vice President and Clinical Sciences Division and Regulatory Affairs Team Leader at Samsung Bioepis. “The addition of this clinical data reinforces Samsung Bioepis’ ongoing commitment to bringing affordable treatment options to millions of patients with unmet medical needs.”
“As the global prevalence of age-related macular degeneration is increasing with the aging population, there will be a rising demand for anti-VEGF therapies,” said Se Joon Woo, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, South Korea. “Biosimilars for anti-VEGF therapies will enable more patients to gain access to treatments and contribute to the prevention of AMD-related blindness.”
A total of 705 patients were enrolled in the Phase 3 study and 634 patients completed the study up to week 52. The study met its primary endpoints, defined as changes from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at week 8 and central subfield thickness (CST) at week 4. Secondary endpoints included long-term efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity, which were comparable between SB11 and reference ranibizumab.
In May 2020, Samsung Bioepis announced 24-week interim results from the Phase 3 study , and the full manuscript on 24-week data is expected to be published in JAMA Ophthalmology in 2020.
The company announced in November 2019 that it has entered into a new commercialization agreement with Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) for two ophthalmology biosimilar candidates, SB11 (ranibizumab) and SB15 (aflibercept), in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Europe, Japan, and Australia.

SB11 Phase 3 Study
The SB11 Phase 3 study was a randomized, double-masked, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of SB11 compared to reference ranibizumab in patients with nAMD. 705 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive SB11 or reference ranibizumab in monthly injections (0.5 mg), and 634 patients continued to receive treatment up to week 48. Change from baseline in BCVA, CST and other parameters were compared through week 52. Primary endpoints were analyzed by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and equivalence was declared if the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of the difference of the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 8 between two treatments was within the pre-defined margin of ± 3 letters and if the two-sided 95% CI of the difference of the LS mean change from baseline in CST (based on assessment by central reading center) at week 4 between two treatments was within the pre-defined margin of ± 36 μm. Secondary endpoints were long-term efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity.
The LS mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 8 showed an adjusted treatment difference of −0.8 letters (90% CI: −1.8 to 0.2) between SB11 and reference ranibizumab, and the LS mean change from baseline in CST at week 4 showed an adjusted treatment difference of −8 μm (95% CI: −19 to 3) between two products. The LS mean change in BCVA from baseline at week 52 was 9.79 letters for SB11, compared with 10.41 letters for reference ranibizumab (difference: -0.62, [90% CI: -2.092, 0.857]). The LS mean change in CST was −139.55 μm for SB11 vs −124.46 μm for reference ranibizumab (difference: -15.09, [95% CI, -25.617, -4.563]). PK, safety including incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, and the immunogenicity profile of SB11 and reference ranibizumab were comparable at all timepoints up to week 52.

53126,Roche's Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S Receives the US FDA's EUA to Detect Ab Against SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein,Roche receives FDA Emergency Use Authorization for new test to measure the level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,"The US FDA’s EUA follows the launch of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S Ab test for markets accepting the CE Mark. The serology test can be used to measure the level of Abs in people who have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus
 The test has both a high NPA of 99.98% and PPA of 96.6%, 15days or later after diagnosis with a PCR test. The test may help identify recovering patients who could potentially be serum & plasma donors for developing treatments for COVID-19
 The test runs on Roche’s cobas e analyzers and is the latest addition to Roche’s diagnostic portfolio to help healthcare systems combat COVID-19 through testing in the laboratory and at the POC","Basel, 2 December 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that its Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody test has received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The serology (blood) test can be used to measure the level of antibodies in people who have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The EUA in the United States follows the launch of the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody test for markets accepting the CE Mark announced on 18 September.

The new test targets antibodies that are directed against the region of the novel coronavirus known as the spike protein, specifically the area that enables the virus to bind to a host cell receptor, which is required for the virus to enter the host cell.1,2 Many current candidate vaccines aim to induce an antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Tests that quantify antibodies to the spike protein could be used to measure the level of that response and track that measurement over time. The test provides a numerical result describing the concentration of antibodies from 0.40-250 U/mL as well as a qualitative result.

“Since the start of this pandemic, our focus has been to bring effective diagnostic testing solutions to the fight against COVID-19,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “Antibody tests like these will play a critical role in measuring a person’s vaccine-induced immune response”.

In addition to its role in helping to measure a patient’s immune response, the test may help guide the allocation of plasma donations from recovered COVID-19 patients to current patients by identifying donors that have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Convalescent plasma therapy is an investigational procedure that separates and removes the plasma from a patient’s blood. This plasma is then replaced with plasma from a donor to give the ill patient antibodies to help fight the virus.

The laboratory-based Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test runs on Roche’s widely available cobas e analyzers and is the latest addition to Roche’s growing diagnostic portfolio to help healthcare systems combat COVID-19 through testing in the laboratory and at the point of care. Currently, this portfolio includes molecular, serology and digital solutions that help healthcare professionals diagnose COVID-19 and provide optimal patient care during the initial stages of infection and the recovery phase, as well as following the resolution of infection.

About SARS-CoV-2
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain which has not previously been identified in humans.

Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and fever. In more severe cases, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death can occur.3

About the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test
The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test is an immunoassay for the in vitro determination of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Through a blood sample, the test can measure antibodies to the spike protein of the coronavirus, which could signal whether a person has been already infected. The test has both a high negative percent agreement (NPA) of 99.98% (N=5991) and positive percent agreement (PPA) of 96.6% (N=233), 15 days or later after diagnosis with a PCR test. With this test, Roche also showed titer development over time for patient samples ranging >100 days following a reactive PCR result, with no samples showing a decline of titers below the reactive range. Additionally, across panels of potentially cross-reactive samples (N=1100) from endemic human coronaviruses, infectious respiratory diseases, other infectious diseases, auto-immune and liver related diseases, the test demonstrated zero cross-reactivity. This test has been authorized only for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens.

Clinical laboratories can run these tests on Roche’s cobas e analyzers which are widely available around the world. These fully automated systems can provide antibody test results in approximately 18 minutes, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyzer.4

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
To address the global COVID-19 healthcare crisis, Roche has developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help detect and diagnose the infection in patients, as well as providing digital support to healthcare systems. Roche also continues to identify, develop and support potential therapies that can play a role in treating the disease.

Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. Roche continues to work with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organizations to help make sure that patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need during these challenging times.

The Roche portfolio of COVID-19 solutions includes:

a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, (FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and available in countries accepting the CE Mark)
a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-based antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood targeting the nucleocapsid (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
an IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19 (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
a high-volume molecular test to simultaneously detect and differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B, as the symptoms are similar for both (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
a second SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, aimed at measuring antibody response to the spike protein, to help assess a patient’s immune response and support the development of convalescent plasma therapy
a point-of-care molecular PCR test that simultaneously detects and differentiates between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B infections to support urgent triage and diagnosis (FDA EUA and CE Mark)

HLX04 is a bevacizumab biosimilar developed by Henlius independently in accordance withTechnical Guidelines for the Development and Evaluation of Biosimilars (Tentative). The New Drug Application (NDA) of HLX04 has been accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). Potential indications of HLX04 include advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. Different from currently approved bevacizumab biosimilars in China, the Phase 3 study of HLX04 was conducted among Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, which helps to accumulate more clinical evidence and experience of bevacizumab in this patient population.

The Phase 3 clinical study data also laid the foundation for the development of the immune combination therapy of HLX04 and Henlius’ anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody HLX10. Of note is that HLX04 plus HLX10 is the first domestic dual monoclonal antibody (mAb) combo therapy that has received Investigational New Drug Application approval from NMPA. This combination therapy is currently being investigated in various solid tumours such as non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical development of this combination therapy in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients has entered pivotal Phase 3 stage.

In addition, to explore the potential activity of VEGF inhibitors against ophthalmic diseases and for the benefit of more patients, Henlius is also developing HLX04 for the treatment of eye diseases including wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and diabetic retinopathy(DR). The investigational new drug application has been approved by NMPA. Recently, Henlius has also entered into a co-development and exclusive license agreement with Essex Bio-Technology to co-develop HLX04 indicated for ophthalmic diseases such as wAMD, fully utilizing the advantages of Henlius in research and development and Essex in global commercialisation of ophthalmic drugs. As of now, Henlius has submitted a patent for a new formulation of HLX04 with potential better safety and stability, designed for ophthalmic use.

Study design

HLX04-mCRC03 is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-controlled Phase 3 study (NCT03511963) aimed to compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of HLX04 to reference bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy (XELOX or mFOLFOX6) as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Enrolled patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either HLX04 or reference bevacizumab intravenously (7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks when combined with XELOX or 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks when combined with mFOLFOX6). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at week 36 (PFSR36wk).

Results

· Efficacy-Primary endpoint

675 patients were enrolled (HLX04, N=338; Reference bevacizumab, N=337). Per FAS, PFSR36wk were 46.4% in HLX04 group and 50.7% in reference bevacizumab group. The group difference was −4.2% (90% CI: −10.6%, 2.1%), which fell entirely in the pre-defined equivalence margins (−11%, 15%), demonstrating equivalent efficacy between HLX04 and reference bevacizumab.

· Efficacy-Secondary endpoints

There was no statistically significant difference (p >0.05) between the treatment groups in secondary endpoints, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), time to response (TTR) and duration of response (DoR).

· Safety and immunogenicity

The safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar between HLX04 and reference bevacizumab.

 

Conclusion

The results of the Phase 3 study demonstrated the equivalence in efficacy between HLX04 and reference bevacizumab with similar safety and immunogenicity profiles as first-line treatment for mCRC patients.

The company might get ~45M within the first 12mos. of collaboration
 Following the completion of pre-clinical development, AbbVie will lead global development and commercialization activities and costs for the programs whereas Frontier will retain an option to share development activities and expenses for certain oncology programs through the completion of P-II
 AbbVie retains the right to expand the collaboration in the future by exercising options to a defined number of additional targets","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill. and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, and Frontier Medicines, Corp., a precision medicine company drugging challenging protein targets to develop breakthrough medicines that change the course of human diseases, today announced a global strategic collaboration to discover, develop and commercialize a pipeline of innovative small molecule therapeutics against high-interest, difficult-to-drug protein targets.

Under the multi-year collaboration, AbbVie and Frontier will utilize Frontier’s proprietary chemoproteomics platform to identify small molecules for programs directed to novel E3 ligases and certain oncology and immunology targets. Whereas conventional drug discovery methodologies have been primarily successful against a relatively discrete set of target classes, chemoproteomics-based screening in relevant cellular contexts has the potential to enable targeting of a significantly broader range of proteins. By selecting certain immunology and oncology targets for the collaboration that are considered well validated but to date, inaccessible, the collaboration has the potential to develop highly differentiated and efficacious therapeutics.

Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie will pay Frontier an upfront cash payment of $55 million, and Frontier is eligible to receive additional milestone payments. In addition, AbbVie will reimburse Frontier’s R&D costs through defined stages of pre-clinical development. The companies will collaborate on the research and pre-clinical development of programs directed against E3 ligase, immunology and oncology targets. Upon successful completion of defined stages of pre-clinical development, AbbVie will assume full responsibility for global development and commercialization activities and costs for the programs. Frontier will retain an option to share development activities and expenses for certain oncology programs through the completion of Phase 2. Frontier will be eligible to receive success-based development and commercial milestone payments that could potentially exceed $1 billion, in addition to royalty payments on commercialized products. AbbVie retains the right to expand the collaboration in the future by exercising options to a defined number of additional targets. The collaboration excludes all of Frontier’s internal programs for which Frontier retains exclusive global rights.

“AbbVie is focused on making investments in promising new technologies that assist us in our mission to develop innovative medicines,” said Jose-Carlos Gutiérrez-Ramos, Ph.D., vice president, Discovery, AbbVie. “One of our key strategic focus areas is targeted protein degradation and chemoproteomics, and this collaboration with Frontier Medicines will be highly synergistic and complementary to our ongoing efforts.”

“AbbVie’s commitment to innovative therapies makes them an ideal partner in the development and commercialization of new medicines for cancer and immunological diseases,” said Chris Varma, Ph.D., Frontier’s co-founder, chairman, and CEO. “With our powerful chemoproteomics platform, we are greatly expanding the universe of therapeutic targets that can be accessed with small molecule drugs. This partnership enables us to build a shared pipeline of novel therapeutics with AbbVie, while Frontier continues to independently advance our internal programs into the clinic.”

Earlier, Sulinno was approved for RA, PS, and psoriasis
 The launch of Sulinno has provided more Chinese patients with high-quality and relatively affordable adalimumab injection, bringing hope and opportunities to more patients
 Sulinno is a human anti-TNF-α mAb referencing Humira. The clinical results were published at the Inaugural Issue of The Lancet Rheumatology in 2019","SAN FRANCISCO and SUZHOU, China, Nov. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that SULINNO® (adalimumab injection), a recombinant human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody drug, has been officially approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), which is the fourth approved indication of SULINNO® in China. On September 2, 2020, SULINNO® was approved by NMPA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is defined as arthritis with an unknown cause lasting at least 6 weeks in children aged 16 years or younger. Arthritis is divided into oligarthritis （<5 joints）and polyarthritis. Polyarthritis can be further divided into rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarthritis and RF-positive polyarthritis. It is estimated RF-negative polyarticular JIA affects 1 to 4 per 100,000 children annually. Less commonly, RF-positive polyarticular JIA occurs in an estimated 0.3 to 0.7 per 100,000 children each year. JIA occurs in children at a young age, and is often accompanied by many complications that will lead to high rates of defects, disability and mortality when left untreated, deeply impacting the quality of life in children. Early aggressive therapy leads to improved outcomes and prevents potential disease complications.

Since the launch of adalimumab, it has been approved worldwide for the treatment of seventeen diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriasis arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, crohn’s disease (including pediatric crohn’s disease), ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, etc. The efficacy and safety of adalimumab has been well recognized globally, and adalimumab injection is widely used in the North America and Europe. It has been consistently recommended in multiple diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of these diseases, and its significant efficacy has been universally recognized. SULINNO® is adalimumab biosimilar developed by Innovent, and its clinical results were published in the Inaugural Issue of The Lancet Rheumatology in 2019. The launch of SULINNO® has provided more Chinese patients with high-quality and relatively affordable adalimumab injection, bringing hope and opportunities to more patients.

Dr. Qian Lei, Senior Director of Medical Sciences and Strategies of Special Diseases of Innovent, stated: “Not only does Juvenile idiopathic arthritic lead to functional impairment and decrease in quality of life and social participation in children, but also places a huge economic burden on their families. The approval of SULINNO® will provide a high-quality and accessible treatment option for children with polyarticular idiopathic arthritis in China. We hope that this product will benefit more children with polyarticular idiopathic arthritis and their families, allowing them to receive early treatment with high-quality biological drugs.”

About SULINNO®

SULINNO® is an adalimumab (Humira®) biosimilar and a recombinant human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody independently developed by Innovent. TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine mainly produced by activated macrophages, natural killer cells and T lymphocytes, which is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Anti-TNF-α antibody can bind to human TNF-α monomer or trimer, block TNF-α binding to the cellular surface receptor, p55 and p75, and neutralize the cytotoxic effect of TNF-α, thereby inhibiting the release of TNF-α mediated inflammatory factors and cytokines, the adhesion and infiltration of inflammatory cells, the proliferation of fibroblasts and the activation of osteoclasts.

The results of a complete pre-clinical comparison showed that SULINNO® has similar in vitro biological activity (binding activity to target antigen TNF-α and neutralizing activity), physicochemical property and pharmacokinetic characteristics to those of Humira®. The similarities were also demonstrated in pharmacological and toxicological studies. The head-to-head clinical study comparing SULINNO® and Humira® conducted in patients with ankylosing spondylitis demonstrated a clinical similarity. The study results were published at Inaugural Issue of The Lancet Rheumatology in 2019.

AstraZeneca in breast cancer

Driven by a growing understanding of breast cancer biology, AstraZeneca is starting to challenge, and redefine, the current clinical paradigm for how breast cancer is classified and treated to deliver even more effective treatments to patients in need – with the bold ambition to one day eliminate breast cancer as a cause of death.

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and promising compounds in development that leverage different mechanisms of action to address the biologically diverse breast cancer tumour environment. AstraZeneca aims to continue to transform outcomes for HR-positive breast cancer with foundational medicines Faslodex (fulvestrant) and Zoladex (goserelin) and the next-generation SERD and potential new medicine AZD9833. PARP inhibitor, Lynparza (olaparib) was the first targeted treatment option for metastatic breast cancer patients with an inherited BRCA mutation. AstraZeneca with MSD (Merck & Co., Inc. in the US and Canada) continue to research Lynparza in metastatic breast cancer patients with an inherited BRCA mutation and are exploring new opportunities to treat these patients earlier in their disease state. Building on the first approval of Enhertu, a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate, in previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo are exploring its potential in earlier lines of treatment and in new breast cancer settings. To bring much needed treatment options to patients with triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of breast cancer, AstraZeneca is testing immunotherapy durvalumab in combination with other oncology medicines, including Lynparza and Enhertu, investigating the potential of AKT kinase inhibitor, capivasertib, in combination with chemotherapy, and collaborating with Daiichi Sankyo to explore the potential of TROP2-directed ADC, datopotamab deruxtecan (DS-1062).

Patients with AMD often have low levels of CD59, a protein that protects the retina from damage caused by an essential part of the body’s natural immune response called “complement.” In geographic atrophy, an overactivity of complement destroys cells in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for central vision and seeing fine details, and results in a relentless progression to blindness. HMR59 is designed to increase the ability of retina cells to make a soluble form of CD59, helping to prevent further damage to the retina and preserve vision.

Geographic atrophy affects five millioni people globally, and is a leading cause of blindness in people over 50 years of age. The prevalence of geographic atrophy increases as the global population ages with roughly one in 29 people over age 75 affected, and nearly one in four people over age 90. There are currently no available therapies other than vitamins and low vision aids.

“Geographic atrophy is a devastating form of AMD that impacts the ability to accomplish everyday tasks, such as reading, driving, cooking, or even seeing faces,” said James F. List, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular & Metabolism, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Our aim with this novel, single-administration gene therapy is to use our development expertise and deep heritage in vision care to help improve patient outcomes by intervening early, halting the progression to blindness, and preserving more years of sight.”

Gene therapy is an important modality for both therapeutic delivery and protein replacement, and one of the ways Janssen aims to significantly improve health outcomes for patients. Beginning with the eye, Janssen is rapidly developing expertise in the manufacturing, development, and commercialization of gene therapies across a range of mechanisms of action, building the case for future applications to other parts of the body.

“At Janssen, we pursue the best science to uncover transformational treatments that meet patient needs, which often means pioneering the solution. This is especially the case with gene therapy and late-stage eye diseases where the paths are largely uncharted,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. “Through this acquisition, we are blazing the trail to bring innovative solutions to patients who are losing their vision.”

The Phase 1 study of HMR59 for patients with geographic atrophy is complete. A second Phase 1 study exploring HMR59 in patients with wet-AMD is currently conducting follow-up visits to evaluate long-term safety.

The collaboration does not include Artios’s lead programmes, Polθ and ATR inhibitors, for which Artios will retain all rights.

Nucleases are critical enzymes involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Cancer cells are dependent on nucleases for their survival in response to DNA damage. Also, in certain cancers which exhibit mutations in DNA damage response pathways, inhibiting key nucleases can lead to selective cancer cell killing i.e. synthetic lethality.

As part of the agreement, Artios will receive a payment of US$30 million in the form of an up-front and near-term payments. If Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany chooses to exercise the option, subject to double-digit option fees, Artios will be eligible to receive up to US$860 million per target, in addition to up to double digit royalty payments on net sales of each product commercialized by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.

 The company has established an EAP for patients in the US who may be eligible to obtain access to mivantamab during the review of the BLA
 Amivantamab is an EGFR & MET bispecific Ab with the immune cell-directing activity that targets tumors with activating & resistance to EGFR & MET mutations & amplifications. Amivantamab has received the US FDA’s BTD in Mar’2020","RARITAN, N.J., Dec. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval of amivantamab for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The application marks the first-ever regulatory submission for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.1 The Company has also established an expanded access program (EAP) [NCT04599712]2 for patients in the U.S. who may be eligible to obtain access to amivantamab during review of the BLA. For information about Janssen’s pre-approval access program, visit https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-use-pre-approval-access.

Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human EGFR and mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumors with activating and resistance EGFR and MET mutations and amplifications.3,4,5,6 In March 2020, amivantamab received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for this population.7

“This submission marks an important step forward in our drive toward evolving the treatment landscape for patients with NSCLC who have EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and for whom there are no FDA-approved targeted treatment options,” said Peter Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We are committed to the development of therapies like amivantamab that progress precision medicine and target specific pathways, and to providing access through expanded access programs.”

The BLA submission for amivantamab is based on data from the monotherapy arm of the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study evaluating the safety and efficacy of amivantamab as a monotherapy and in combination with lazertinib*, a novel third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)8, in adult patients with advanced NSCLC.9 In the study, investigators assessed efficacy using overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1** (RECIST v1.1), clinical benefit rate, and duration of response and progression-free survival, as well as the safety profile of amivantamab.8,10 Early data about amivantamab as a monotherapy treatment in patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2020 Virtual Scientific Program (Abstract #9512).10 

“Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Given this significant unmet need, we at Johnson & Johnson are committed to improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with this complex, deadly disease. With today’s submission for amivantamab, we are one step closer to that goal,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. “We are steadfast in our focus to advance novel therapeutics and medicines that will transform the trajectory of some of the most challenging and deadly diseases of our time, including lung cancer.”

EGFR mutations, leading to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and division11, are some of the most common mutations in NSCLC.12 EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are the third most prevalent primary EGFR mutation.13 However, EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are also often undetected.13 Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is effective at detecting EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and broader use of NGS can help to detect these mutations.14 Cancer driven by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is generally insensitive to approved EGFR TKI treatments and, in addition, carries a worse prognosis compared with cancer driven by more common EGFR mutations, including exon 19 deletions/L858R substitutions.15 Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a median survival of less than 17 months,16 which is much shorter than patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations, who have a median survival of 32-39 months.17

*In 2018, Janssen entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib.

**RECIST (version 1.1) refers to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, which is a standard way to measure how well solid tumors respond to treatment and is based on whether tumors shrink, stay the same, or get bigger.

About Amivantamab 
Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumors with activating and resistance EGFR mutations and MET mutations and amplifications.3,4,5,6 Amivantamab is pending regulatory review as a potential treatment for patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose tumors typically do not respond to current standard of care. Companion diagnostics to identify patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have been an integral part of the development program for amivantamab. The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.’s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBody® technology platform.

About the Amivantamab Expanded Access Program Protocol (EAP)
The amivantamab EAP is for U.S. patients 18 years of age or older who have histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who are not amenable to curative therapy and whose disease has progressed during or after current standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy, who may benefit from treatment with amivantamab prior to its potential FDA approval.2 The EAP has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients to be considered for enrollment in the program, and patients must not be eligible for another amivantamab study.2 Interested patients should contact their physician to discuss whether they may be a candidate for amivantamab through the EAP.2 Additional information about the expanded access protocol can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04599712) and at https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-use-pre-approval-access.

About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cancer, and NSCLC makes up 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers.18,19 The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.19 Among the most common driver mutations in NSCLC are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase supporting cell growth and division.11 EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of patients with NSCLC and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients who have NSCLC adenocarcinoma.20 The five-year survival rate for all patients with metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs is less than 20 percent.21,22 Estimated median overall survival for patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is shorter than in patients with common EGFR mutations.11

53197,Jazz Pharma and PharmaMar's Zepzelca Fail to Meet its Primary Endpoint in P-III ATLANTIS Study for SCLC,Jazz Pharmaceuticals and PharmaMar Announce Results of ATLANTIS Phase 3 Study Evaluating Zepzelca™ in Combination with Doxorubicin for Patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer Following One Prior Platinum-containing Line,"The P-III ATLANTIS study involves assessing Zepzelca (lurbinectedin, 2.0mg/m2) + doxorubicin vs topotecan/ CAV in 613 adult patients in a ratio (1:1) aged ≥18yrs. with SCLC whose disease progressed following one prior Pt.-containing line
 The study did not meet its 1EP of OS in the ITT population while there were no adverse effects on OS with the experimental arm. The safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of Zepzelca monothx. with no new safety signals observed
 Zepzelca is an alkylating drug that binds guanine residues within DNA. The therapy received the US FDA’s accelerated approval in Jun’2020 for m-SCLC with disease progression on or after Pt.-based CT","DUBLIN, Dec. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ), along with its partner, PharmaMar (MSE: PHM), today announce results from the ATLANTIS Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, controlled study evaluating Zepzelca™ (lurbinectedin) in combination with doxorubicin versus physician’s choice of topotecan or cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine (CAV) for adult patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) whose disease progressed following one prior platinum-containing line. Patients received lurbinectedin at 2.0mg/m2 in the combination arm, which is lower than the FDA approved dose of Zepzelca at 3.2mg/m2.

The study did not meet the pre-specified criteria of significance for the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population comparing lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin to the control arm, though there was no adverse effect on OS with the experimental arm. Based on the study design, no additional hypotheses were formally tested. Importantly, key secondary and subgroup analyses favored the lurbinectedin combination arm. Lurbinectedin monotherapy was not tested in ATLANTIS.

The safety data in this study was consistent with the known safety profile of lurbinectedin monotherapy with no new safety signals observed. The experimental arm showed favorable safety and tolerability with regard to Grade-3 or greater drug related adverse events (AEs), deaths due to AEs, hematologic toxicity, dose reductions and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, compared to the control arm.

“Bringing Zepzelca to the U.S. market earlier this year alongside our partner, PharmaMar, was an important advance for adults with metastatic SCLC, an aggressive disease with a historically poor prognosis,” said Robert Iannone M.D., M.S.C.E., executive vice president, research and development of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. “While the combination of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin did not achieve the primary endpoint in this study, the overall results support the activity and tolerability of lurbinectedin in this line of therapy. We look forward to the further development of lurbinectedin in SCLC and other tumors, both as monotherapy and in combination.”

“We remain committed to improving outcomes for patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer where there is a high unmet medical need; we continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lurbinectedin in SCLC and other tumors. The drug’s activity in this disease and setting has been reinforced in this trial,” said Luis Mora, managing director, oncology business unit, PharmaMar. “We extend our gratitude to the patients, physicians and their staff as well as caregivers who participated in this clinical study.”

“Historically, patients with relapsed SCLC often face difficult odds due to the aggressive nature of the disease and they have had very limited treatment options. As a physician treating patients with SCLC, I’m confident in lurbinectedin as an effective new option in this traditionally challenging therapeutic area,” Alberto Chiappori, MD, senior member of oncology and medicine for the Department of Thoracic Oncology at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute and ATLANTIS Phase 3 study investigator.

Results will be discussed with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will be presented at a future medical meeting.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zepzelca under accelerated approval in June 2020 for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The approval is based on ORR and duration of response demonstrated in an open-label, monotherapy clinical study. The companies will provide the ATLANTIS data to FDA and look forward to working with the agency to determine the confirmatory data that is needed for full approval.

ATLANTIS Phase 3 Study Design
The ATLANTIS Phase 3 study enrolled 613 patients at 154 sites primarily in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and Western Europe from September 2016 through July 2018. Patients enrolled were ≥18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of limited or extensive stage SCLC, had failed one prior platinum-containing regimen, and had a chemotherapy-free interval (CTFI, time from the last dose of first-line chemotherapy to the occurrence of progressive disease) ≥ 30 days. Patient inclusion criteria included small-cell carcinoma of unknown primary site with or without neuroendocrine features confirmed in histology test(s) performed on metastatic lesion(s) are eligible, if Ki-67/MIB-1 is expressed in >50 percent of tumor cells.

In the trial, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin or physician’s choice of topotecan OR cyclophosphamide/doxor ubicin/vincristine (CAV). The primary endpoint was overall survival. The secondary endpoints were 1) the difference in OS for patients in the lurbinectedin/doxorubicin arm compared to patients treated with CAV; 2) OS and progression free survival (PFS) in patients with or without CNS involvement; 3) PFS by independent review committee (IRC); 4) antitumor activity defined by objective response rate (ORR) per IRC; and 5) duration of response per IRC.

The study sample was stratified by the following factors: CTFI (chemotherapy free interval); ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1-2); CNS involvement vs. no involvement; prior immunotherapy against either programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1); and investigator preference of topotecan and CAV.

About Zepzelca™ (lurbinectedin)
Zepzelca is an alkylating drug that binds guanine residues within DNA. This triggers a cascade of events that can affect the activity of DNA binding proteins, including some transcription factors, and DNA repair pathways, resulting in disruption of the cell cycle and eventual cell death.1

Zepzelca for injection 4 mg is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with a kind of lung cancer called small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) and who have received treatment with chemotherapy that contains platinum, and it did not work or is no longer working. Zepzelca is approved based on response rate and how long the response lasted. Additional studies will further evaluate the benefit of Zepzelca for this use.

In preclinical studies, ReS19-T has shown to robustly restore synaptic plasticity with an acute response and improve inflammation and AD pathology over a longer treatment duration
 reMYND has a broad pipeline of novel programs in development, with a diabetes program scheduled to initiate human trials in mid-2021
 RES19-T is a novel approach addressing the AD at its root and restore cognition in patients by reducing the cellular damage associated with memory loss","Leuven Belgium, 03 December 2020: reMYND NV, a clinical stage company developing innovative treatments for Alzheimer’s, diabetes and other diseases caused by cellular dysfunction, today announces commencement of a first-in-human trial of its wholly owned therapeutic candidate RES19-T.

As part of its transition into a clinical stage Company, reMYND has also strengthened its Board and senior leadership team with the appointment of Staph Leavenworth Bakali as Chair of the Board and Hermann Russ as Chief Medical Officer.

RES19-T, a first-in-class small molecule, represents a novel approach to treat Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), aiming to address the disease at its root and restore cognition in patients by reducing the cellular damage associated with memory loss. ReS19-T is the first in a pipeline of candidates developed using reMYND’s proprietary drug discovery platform, which identifies disease-modifying small molecule treatments and their novel target and mechanism of action to counteract the toxicity that leads to cellular dysfunction. reMYND has a broader pipeline of novel programs in development, with a diabetes program scheduled to begin in-human trials in mid-2021.

Prof. Philip Scheltens, MD, PhD, Neurologist and CEO of the Alzheimer Center Amsterdam commented “I am very pleased to see this program enter the clinic. The reMYND team has been meticulous in their research, focussing on fundamental cellular processes related to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s, resulting in this novel and differentiated approach.

“Our hope, backed by promising pre-clinical and animal data, is that restoring calcium homeostasis, a process central in the Alzheimer’s disease cascade, will result in a reduction in synaptic damage and translate into improvement in function and biomarkers in patients. This is an important line of enquiry into this devastating disease and we look forward to learning more as the study progresses.”

The trial, a phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an adaptive dose design, will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ReS19-T in healthy subjects.

Studies in AD have shown that loss of memory is most closely linked to loss of synaptic plasticity, leading to neuronal degeneration. In four different preclinical models, ReS19-T has shown to robustly restore synaptic plasticity with an acute response and improve inflammation and AD pathology over a longer treatment duration, providing changes in recognized biomarkers for clinical translatability to symptomatic relief as well as disease modification.

Koen De Witte, Managing Director of reMYND commented “This is an exciting time for reMYND as we enter the clinic for the first time, representing a great step forward in our journey. Our vision is to develop new medicines which go beyond symptom relief and are able to restore function in diseases caused by cellular dysfunction, with Alzheimer’s and diabetes as our two most advanced programs. We believe our unique drug discovery platform enables us to identify novel small molecules which will allow us to address the root of these diseases, counteracting and potentially reversing the damage caused by cellular dysfunction. The exceptional group of people we have been able to rally around our platform and programs as we move into the clinic speaks volumes about the quality and potential of the work we are doing.”

– Now for children (ages 4 and older) and adults with diabetes, this latest technology sustains excellent performance for up to 14 days, providing trends, insights and actionable data on a reader or with the FreeStyle LibreLink mobile app – all at the same price as the current FreeStyle Libre system

– Latest sensor-based glucose monitoring technology will be available in the coming months to the more than 3.7 million Canadians with diabetes2

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Dec. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE:ABT) today announced its next-generation, sensor-based glucose monitoring technology, FreeStyle Libre 2, received approval by Health Canada for adults and children (4 and older) with diabetes. With new features such as optional, real-time alarms1 that measure glucose levels every minute, FreeStyle Libre 2 gives users the option to be alerted in real-time of critical events such as hypoglycemia (low glucose levels3) or hyperglycemia (high glucose levels4). The wearable technology, which eliminates the need for painful fingersticks5, also provides people with diabetes with excellent accuracy and actionable information to better manage their condition, and will be priced at the same cost as the current FreeStyle Libre system.

“For the millions of Canadians with diabetes, Abbott’s next-generation FreeStyle Libre 2 system expands on the life-changing capabilities of our original FreeStyle Libre system with enhanced accuracy, optional alarms and now available for children,” said Marie-Flore Nabor, general manager of Abbott’s diabetes care business in Canada. “This latest technology will transform the way diabetes is currently managed. The FreeStyle Libre 2 is designed to simplify this often complicated-to-manage condition and is accessible and affordable to people with diabetes in Canada.”

How FreeStyle Libre 2 Works

As the world leader in sensor-based glucose monitoring,6 Abbott continues to transform how people with diabetes test their glucose levels. Using Bluetooth technology, the FreeStyle Libre 2 system automatically alerts7 users when their glucose is high or low without needing to scan the sensor.

The FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor is worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days and measures glucose every minute to help users and their healthcare providers make informed treatment decisions. With a one-second scan using FreeStyle LibreLink, a smartphone app,8 or handheld reader, users can see their glucose reading, trend arrow and eight-hour history. Users can also share data with their physicians or family members via the LibreLinkUp mobile app.

Abbott′s FreeStyle Libre 2 system utilizes the same proprietary wired enzyme technology as the FreeStyle Libre system, which was the first to remove painful fingersticks5 and is associated with better glucose control9, decreased time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia10, more time in optimal glucose range7, and improved HbA1C11. A real-world study published in the British Medical Journal shows that the use of FreeStyle Libre system over one year is often associated with improved quality of life and that work absenteeism rate and diabetes-related hospital admissions decreased by two thirds.12

“Adding an alarm to this glucose sensing technology is definitely a major step to help people with diabetes live more confidently with less fear of high or low glucose levels,” said Dr. Bruce Perkins, M.D., Director, Leadership Sinai Centre for Diabetes and Clinician-Scientist, University of Toronto. “We have seen from research with similar technologies that this kind of innovation can improve glucose level control, and even prevent emergency room visits and hospitalizations. For kids and adults alike, it means less pain from fingersticks, much greater insight into patterns, and much more reassurance.”

Abbott′s FreeStyle Libre 2 system will be available for people with diabetes ages 4 and up in Canada in the coming months.

As the #1 sensor-based glucose monitoring system used worldwide,6 Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre portfolio has changed the lives of more than 2.5 million people across more than 50 countries. Abbott has also secured partial or full reimbursement for the FreeStyle Libre system in 37 countries, including Canada where residents of Ontario and Quebec13 who manage diabetes with insulin are covered. Other countries include France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.

 Exactech expects a pilot launch of the Muvr technology in early 2021, with a full release of the platform by the end of 2021. Additionally, the company plans to develop the technology to support shoulder and ankle replacement surgery","GAINESVILLE, Fla.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Exactech, a developer and producer of innovative implants, instrumentation and smart technologies for joint replacement surgery, today announced the acquisition of Muvr Labs Inc, a pioneer in intelligent patient wearables and digital communication tools. The latest addition to Exactech’s Active Intelligence® platform of technologies, the Muvr portfolio is designed to help surgeons engage with their joint replacement patients throughout the journey of care.

The Muvr platform includes patient wearables, mobile device applications and chatbot texting, which allow surgeons to remotely monitor patient recovery. The wearable device continuously provides the healthcare team with real-time data on each patient’s experience and recovery. Wireless sensors worn by the patient measure the individual’s range of motion, not simply steps taken. The patent-protected, self-calibrating design allows the patient to manage the wearable independently without additional in-person office visits and requires minimal intervention by the healthcare team.

Muvr’s corresponding tablet application provides surgeons a dashboard to easily identify at-risk patients and connect remotely for follow-up. The surgeon/patient chatbot is a customizable software application that automatically conducts text conversations to provide patient reminders and respond to patients’ most common questions. The Muvr technology is designed to reduce the surgical team’s workload while collecting pain scores, exercise adherence, mobility metrics and survey information.

“We are incredibly excited to join efforts with the team at Muvr to transform the relationship between patients and surgeons through this comprehensive care management platform,” said Darin Johnson, Exactech Chief Executive Officer. “This acquisition demonstrates our continued commitment to delivering personalized, data-driven solutions to improve patient outcomes.”

Orthopaedic surgeon Alexander Sah, MD, in Fremont, Calif. has seen the positive impact of Muvr technology on his practice. “Patients are attracted to the technology because they know our team is monitoring their progress; remarkably, this has caused my patients to take more ownership of their recovery,” he said. “We have already observed an increase in exercise time, patient satisfaction and a reduction in office calls. It’s also very simple to use because it doesn’t require in-office calibration, which allows patients to use the sensors, at home, unsupervised.

Pilot launch of the Muvr technology is slated for early 2021 with full release by year end. The company plans to further develop the technology to support shoulder and ankle replacement surgery. Surgeons may register to learn more about Muvr and Exactech’s Active Intelligence platform of technologies during an educational webinar tomorrow at 8 p.m. EST by visiting www.exac.com/ActiveIntelligenceWebinar.

Results from an integrated analysis of two clinical trials with up to 79 months of follow-up (Abstract #2220)1 demonstrated similar progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rates (ORR) with ibrutinib in patients with or without high-risk genomic features, and further showed significant PFS and ORR benefits with ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil-based therapy regardless of genomic risk features.1

In addition, data with a median follow-up of more than four years were presented from a pooled analysis of 89 patients with high-risk CLL bearing TP53 aberrations from four clinical trials showing that first-line treatment with ibrutinib resulted in sustained efficacy, including PFS, suggesting that ibrutinib has meaningfully improved the poor prognosis in this high-risk population (Abstract #2219).2

“These large integrated data sets with follow-up up to six years, in addition to other data presented at the meeting in similar populations, contribute to the accumulating evidence supporting the clinically meaningful, long-term treatment benefit of ibrutinib as first-line therapy for patients with CLL,” said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Ibrutinib is an approved standard of care in first-line treatment of CLL, and the data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting further demonstrate the durability of responses in CLL patients with traditional high-risk features.”

Two additional studies will be presented in the oral sessions showing real-world treatment patterns or outcomes in patients with CLL treated outside of a clinical trial setting. The first study is a U.S. retrospective analysis describing treatment patterns and time to next treatment (TTNT) in patients with high-risk CLL treated with first-line ibrutinib or chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) (Abstract #372).3 In this U.S. retrospective study, the largest of its kind to date, patients with high-risk CLL treated with single-agent ibrutinib had significantly longer TTNT compared with patients treated with first-line CIT.3 In the second oral presentation, results from the U.S. informCLL™ registry (Abstract #547) highlighted infrequent prognostic biomarker testing rates prior to initiating CLL therapy, and limited use of such information to guide optimal treatment selection for many patients with high-risk CLL, suggesting an opportunity for additional education of healthcare providers.4

Integrated Analysis of the Phase 3 RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE Trials Evaluated Outcomes of First-Line Ibrutinib in Patients with CLL and High-Risk Genomic Features with up to 6.5 Years Follow-up (Abstract #2220)1
Data were presented from a pooled analysis of two Phase 3 studies (RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE) with up to 79 months of follow-up evaluating ibrutinib-based therapy in first-line treatment of CLL patients with various high-risk genomic features.1

Key Study Findings:

In patients treated with ibrutinib-based therapy, PFS was comparable between patients with, versus without, specified high-risk genomic features, including del(17p)/TP53 mutated/BIRC3 mutated, the highest risk category.1
At 42 months, PFS rates were significantly higher across all high-risk genomic subgroups in previously untreated patients treated with ibrutinib-based treatment (63 to 82 percent) compared with those receiving chlorambucil-based treatment (6 to 34 percent) with or without obinutuzumab, regardless of mutation.1
At a median duration of ibrutinib treatment of 35.7-43.8 months across high-risk subgroups, there were no meaningful differences in the rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) of any Grade, or Grade 3 or greater AEs compared to those of the overall population.1
“Certain genomic abnormalities and mutations are predictors of inferior outcomes with chemoimmunotherapy in patients with CLL,” said Jan A. Burger,* M.D., Ph.D., Professor, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and principal study investigator. “Chemoimmunotherapy remains common in real-world practice despite evidence that shows small molecule inhibitor therapies like ibrutinib have demonstrated improved outcomes in high-risk patients compared to chemoimmunotherapy.”

“Since its first European approval in 2014, ibrutinib has redefined treatment paradigms for CLL, and these study results offer further evidence of the benefits and tolerability ibrutinib offers to CLL patients,” adds Dr Catherine Taylor, Vice President, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. “For high-risk CLL patients, the treatment landscape has advanced dramatically, with ibrutinib continuing to play a major role in defining what it means to live with genetic variations of this disease, which have historically poor outcomes.”

Large, Pooled, Multi-Study Dataset Assessed Long-Term Benefit of First-Line Ibrutinib-Based Treatment in Patients with TP53 Aberrations with up to Four Years Follow-up (Abstract #2219)2
Data were presented from a pooled analysis of four clinical studies evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of first-line ibrutinib-based therapy in CLL patients with TP53 aberrations present.2 The four studies were: RESONATE2; iLLUMINATE; the E1912 study designed and conducted by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); and the 1122e study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).2

Key Study Findings:

With a median follow-up of 50 months, median PFS was not reached (95% CI: 67 months to not estimable).2 At 48 months, the PFS rate was 79 percent and the OS rate was 88 percent among high-risk patients treated with ibrutinib monotherapy.2
Additionally, 46 percent of patients with TP53 aberrations remained on ibrutinib treatment and 39 percent had a complete response.2
No new safety signals were identified in this analysis and in general the rates of Grade ≥3 AEs of clinical interest declined after the first year of ibrutinib treatment.2
Clinical Outcomes Among Real-World Patients with CLL Initiating First-Line Ibrutinib or Chemoimmunotherapy Stratified by Risk Status: Results From a U.S. Retrospective Chart Review Study (Abstract #372)3
Data were presented as an oral presentation from a large real-world study comparing clinical outcomes (TTNT) in high-risk and non-high-risk patients with CLL receiving ibrutinib compared to CIT in the first-line setting.3

Key Study Findings:

Data presented showed that high-risk patients receiving ibrutinib significantly prolonged TTNT compared to those receiving CIT.3
Ibrutinib also provided sustained clinical benefit regardless of risk status, which is consistent with clinical trial results.5,6,7
This study highlighted the need for cytogenetic/molecular testing before CIT treatment, consistent with clinical treatment guidelines.8,9
Real-World Prognostic Biomarker Testing, Treatment Patterns, And Dosing Among Patients With CLL From the informCLL™ Prospective Observational Registry (Abstract #547)
An oral presentation on Monday, December 7, will feature results from the informCLL™ real-world prospective observational registry assessing treatment patterns in the era of novel agents.4

Key Study Findings:

The most common index treatment was ibrutinib; the majority of patients treated with ibrutinib remained on therapy at two-year follow-up; and CIT was also used for one-third of patients.4
Data also demonstrated that prognostic biomarker testing rates were poor, especially for the biomarkers TP53 and IGHV.4
Data from informCLL™ also indicate a ‘knowledge gap’ in terms of prognostic marker testing, interpretation and selection of optimal therapies for patients with high-risk disease.4

About Ibrutinib
Ibrutinib is a once-daily, first-in-class Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that is administered orally, and is jointly developed and commercialised by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.10 Ibrutinib blocks the BTK protein; the BTK protein sends important signals that tell B cells to mature and produce antibodies. BTK signalling is needed by specific cancer cells to multiply and spread.11 By blocking BTK, ibrutinib may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environments in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.12

Indications for which ibrutinib is approved in Europe include:10

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): As a single agent or in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL, and as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL): As a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM): As a single agent for the treatment of adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy or in first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy, and in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients
Ibrutinib is approved in more than 100 countries for at least one indication, and to date, has been used to treat more than 200,000 patients worldwide.13

For a full list of side effects and information on dosage and administration, contraindications and other precautions when using ibrutinib please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for further information.

About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is typically a slow-growing blood cancer of the white blood cells.14 The overall incidence of CLL in Europe is approximately 4.92 cases per 100,000 persons per year and is about 1.5 times more common in men than in women.15 CLL is predominantly a disease of the elderly, with a median age of 72 years at diagnosis.16

The disease eventually progresses in the majority of patients, and they are faced with fewer treatment options with each relapse. Patients are often prescribed multiple lines of therapy as they relapse or become resistant to treatments.

53239,Kite Reports Results of Yescarta in P-II ZUMA-5 Study for Adult Patients with R/R Indolent Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,Yescarta® Is First CAR T-cell Therapy to Demonstrate High Response Rates and Durable Clinical Benefit in a Pivotal Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study,"The P-II ZUMA-5 study involves assessing Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in patients with r/r iNHL after at least 2L of systemic therapy. After a single infusion of Yescarta, 92% of patients responded, including 76% of patients achieving a CR @median follow-up of 17.5 mos., results presented at ASH
 The data supports the US FDA’s acceptance of BLA and is currently under PR for r/r FL, MZL, after two or more prior lines of systemic therapy, with an anticipated PDUFA date as Mar 5, 2021
 Yescarta is the first CAR T-cell therapy to be approved by the US FDA for patients with r/r large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy","SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Kite, a Gilead Company (Nasdaq: GILD), today announced results from the primary analysis of ZUMA-5, a global, multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase 2 study evaluating Yescarta® (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) after at least two prior lines of therapy. After a single infusion of Yescarta, 92 percent of iNHL patients (n=104 evaluable for efficacy) responded, including 76 percent of patients achieving a complete response (CR) at a median follow-up of 17.5 months. The data are being presented in an oral session during the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition (Abstract #700). The presentation is also being considered for Best of ASH and has been selected for inclusion in the ASH Annual Meeting Press Program.

Based on these data, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and granted Priority Review designation for Yescarta for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) after two or more prior lines of systemic therapy, with a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of March 5, 2021. Yescarta has previously been granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA for these indications. If approved, Yescarta would become the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapy approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory indolent NHLs.

“It is encouraging to see this level of response to CAR T-cell therapy in a heavily pretreated and multiply relapsed patient population, in whom response duration to other available therapies is expected to be short,” said Caron A. Jacobson, MD, MMSc, Medical Director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Assistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School. “Our goal with treatment is to prolong overall survival, and the impressive durability following a one-time treatment of axicabtagene ciloleucel is incredibly promising for relapsed/refractory patients, who are often at a higher risk for early progression.”

Ninety-four percent of patients with relapsed or refractory FL (n=84) responded to Yescarta, including 80 percent of patients achieving a CR and 64 percent of patients in an ongoing response at a median follow-up of 17.5 months. Of patients with relapsed or refractory MZL (n=20), 85 percent responded to Yescarta, with 60 percent achieving a CR. Median duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were not reached.

In the safety analysis (n=146), Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (NEs) occurred in 7 percent and 19 percent of patients, respectively. Lower incidence of Grade 3 or higher NEs was observed in patients with FL (15 percent) compared to MZL (41 percent), and CRS rates were comparable between the two groups. There were three Grade 5 adverse events, including one patient with multisystem organ failure in the context of CRS related to treatment with Yescarta, one with aortic dissection unrelated to Yescarta treatment, and one with coccidioidomycosis infection unrelated to Yescarta treatment.

“As we continue to advance Kite’s cell therapy franchise, this analysis further demonstrates the practice-changing potential of Yescarta in additional hematologic malignancies,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Kite’s Global Head of Clinical Development. “We’re excited about the potential role of Yescarta in indolent NHL and look forward to continuing to work with the FDA to bring it to these patients as soon as possible.”

Kite has presented four-year survival data for Yescarta in the ZUMA-1 study of patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Based on these data and other data presented at ASH, Kite believes that Yescarta could bring the hope of survival to patients with a number of other hematological malignancies.

Yescarta has not been approved by any regulatory agency for the treatment of indolent NHL, including FL or MZL. Its safety and efficacy have not been established in these lymphomas.

Yescarta was the first CAR T-cell therapy to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from FL. Yescarta is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. The Yescarta U.S. Prescribing Information has a BOXED WARNING for the risks of CRS and neurologic toxicities, and Yescarta is approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) due to these risks; see below for Important Safety Information.

About Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

Follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) are both forms of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in which malignant tumors slowly grow but can become more aggressive over time.

FL is the most common form of indolent lymphoma and the second most common type of lymphoma globally. It accounts for approximately 22 percent of all lymphomas diagnosed worldwide. MZL is the third most common lymphoma, accounting for 8 to 12 percent of all B-cell NHLs.

Despite advances in management and substantial improvements in long-term survival, patients living with FL have varied outcomes. Currently, there are limited options for the treatment of relapsed or refractory FL and MZL after two or more lines of therapy.

About ZUMA-5

ZUMA-5 is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 study that aims to enroll patients (≥18 years old) with relapsed or refractory iNHL of either follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) subtypes, who received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody combined with an alkylating agent. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single infusion of Yescarta in this patient population. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by an independent review committee per the 2014 Lugano Classification. Secondary endpoints include CR rate, DOR, PFS, OS, safety and CAR T cell and cytokines levels. The study is ongoing.

U.S. Important Safety Information for Yescarta

BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME AND NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Yescarta. Do not administer Yescarta to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.
Neurologic toxicities, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Yescarta, including concurrently with CRS or after CRS resolution. Monitor for neurologic toxicities after treatment with Yescarta. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.
Yescarta is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program.
CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS) occurred in 94% of patients, with 13% ≥ Grade 3. Among patients who died after receiving Yescarta, 4 had ongoing CRS at death. The median time to onset was 2 days (range: 1-12 days) and median duration was 7 days (range: 2-58 days). Key manifestations include fever (78%), hypotension (41%), tachycardia (28%), hypoxia (22%), and chills (20%). Serious events that may be associated with CRS include cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, renal insufficiency, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. Ensure that 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to Yescarta infusion. Following infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility, and for 4 weeks thereafter. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated.

NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES occurred in 87% of patients, 98% of which occurred within the first 8 weeks with a median time to onset of 4 days (range: 1-43 days) and a median duration of 17 days. Grade ≥3 occurred in 31% of patients. The most common neurologic toxicities included encephalopathy (57%), headache (44%), tremor (31%), dizziness (21%), aphasia (18%), delirium (17%), insomnia (9%), and anxiety (9%). Prolonged encephalopathy lasting up to 173 days was noted. Serious events including leukoencephalopathy and seizures, as well as fatal and serious cases of cerebral edema have occurred. Following Yescarta infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility, and for 4 weeks thereafter, and treat promptly.

REMS: Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Yescarta is available only through a restricted program called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program which requires that: Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer Yescarta must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements and must have on-site, immediate access to a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab for each patient for infusion within 2 hours after Yescarta infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS. Certified healthcare facilities must ensure that healthcare providers who prescribe, dispense, or administer Yescarta are trained about the management of CRS and neurologic toxicities. Further information is available at www.YescartaTecartusREMS.com or 1-844-454-KITE (5483).

HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: Allergic reactions, including serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis, may occur with the infusion of Yescarta.

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Severe or life-threatening infections occurred. Infections (all grades) occurred in 38% of patients. Grade ≥3 infections occurred in 23% of patients; those due to an unspecified pathogen occurred in 16% of patients, bacterial infections in 9%, and viral infections in 4%. Yescarta should not be administered to patients with clinically significant active systemic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic anti-microbials according to local guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 36% of patients and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. Perform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

PROLONGED CYTOPENIAS: Patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Yescarta infusion. Grade ≥3 cytopenias not resolved by Day 30 following Yescarta infusion occurred in 28% of patients and included thrombocytopenia (18%), neutropenia (15%), and anemia (3%). Monitor blood counts after infusion.

HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA and B-cell aplasia can occur. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 15% of patients. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following Yescarta treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Yescarta treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment.

SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES may develop. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that one occurs, contact Kite at 1-844-454-KITE (5483) to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.

EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following Yescarta infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period.

ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common (incidence ≥20%) include CRS, fever, hypotension, encephalopathy, tachycardia, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, chills, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, infections-pathogen unspecified, nausea, hypoxia, tremor, cough, vomiting, dizziness, constipation, and cardiac arrhythmias.

53244,Roche Reports Long-Term Benefits of Venclexta/Venclyxto Based Combination for R/R Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Roche announces new data reinforcing the long-term benefit of Venclexta/Venclyxto-based combination for people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"Five-year data from P-III MURANO trial shows sustained PFS with Venclexta/Venclyxto + MabThera/Rituxan vs BR in patients with r/r CLL
 The data showed a reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 81%, m-OS (82.1% vs 62.2%), patients who completed 2yrs. of treatment without the progressive disease, 63.8% had uMRD
 The P-III CLL14 study also confirms the potential of MRD measurements to predict future outcomes for people with prior untreated CLL who were treated with fixed-duration Venclexta/Venclyxto + Gazyva/Gazyvaro vs Gazyva/Gazyvaro + chlorambucil","Basel, 5 December 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that new data from the pivotal phase III MURANO and CLL14 studies support the efficacy of fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free Venclexta®/Venclyxto® (venetoclax)-based combinations in certain people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and provide more evidence on the potential value of minimal residual disease (MRD). Data were presented at the all-virtual 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition on Saturday 5 December 2020.

“These results reinforce the long-term value of fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free Venclexta/Venclyxto-based combinations in CLL, potentially offering patients a significant period of time without treatment following initial therapy,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “These data also reflect our ongoing commitment to accelerating clinical advancements for patients by exploring the novel endpoint minimal residual disease as a potential predictor of patient outcomes.”

Five-year data from the pivotal phase III MURANO trial continue to show sustained investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) with Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab). Data, presented in an oral session, showed:

Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 81% (HR= 0.19; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.26; p<0.0001) compared to bendamustine plus MabThera/Rituxan (BR) in people with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CLL.
At the time of analysis, median overall survival (OS) had not been reached in either arm, however, five-year OS was 82.1% in the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan arm, compared to 62.2% in the BR arm (HR=0.40; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.62).
In the Venclexta/Venclyxto arm, among the 130 patients who completed two years of treatment without progressive disease, 63.8% (n=83/130) had undetectable MRD (uMRD) levels at the end of treatment. In an analysis of this patient subgroup, uMRD was associated with improved progression-free survival. Undetectable MRD, sometimes referred to as MRD-negativity, means that no cancer cells could be detected using a specific and highly sensitive test, and is defined as less than one cancer cell in 10,000 leukocytes.
No new safety events were reported in the study.1
Data from the phase III CLL14 study contributes to growing evidence regarding the potential of MRD measurements to predict future outcomes for certain people with previously untreated CLL who were treated with fixed-duration Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® (obinutuzumab):

Patients with uMRD and a partial response (PR) had longer PFS than patients with detectable MRD and a complete response (CR).2
In collaboration with Adaptive Biotechnologies, clonal growth rate, a measure for how quickly cancer cells grow, was analysed using the next-generation sequencing Adaptive clonoSEQ® Assay and insights were used to better understand the potential role of MRD in predicting outcomes. In this analysis, after treatment with fixed-duration Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro, the estimated clonal growth rate was slower and lower, suggesting more effective MRD eradication in these patients compared to those treated with Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil. Early data suggest a correlation between MRD responses and PFS, which will be further evaluated by the study authors.3
Exploring novel endpoints, such as MRD, is an important area of development for Roche, which continues to investigate Venclexta/Venclyxto in a robust clinical development programme. This includes the phase III CRISTALLO trial in previously untreated CLL, which uses MRD as a primary endpoint.

Venclexta/Venclyxto is approved in the US and EU in combination with MabThera/Rituxan for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with Gazyva/Gazyvaro for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL; and as a monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in people who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.

Venclexta/Venclyxto is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the US, under the brand name Venclexta, and commercialised by AbbVie outside of the US.

*Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a measure of the number of remaining cancer cells. Undetectable MRD (uMRD), sometimes referred to as MRD-negativity, means that no cancer cells could be detected using a specific and highly sensitive test, and is defined as less than one cancer cell in 10,000 leukocytes.

About the MURANO study 4
MURANO [NCT02005471] is a phase III open-label, international, multicentre, randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety of fixed-duration Venclexta®/Venclyxto® (venetoclax) in combination with MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab) compared to bendamustine in combination with MabThera/Rituxan (BR). All treatments were of fixed duration. Following a five-week dose ramp-up schedule for Venclexta/Venclyxto, patients on the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan arm received six cycles of Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan followed by Venclexta/Venclyxto monotherapy for up to two years total. Patients on the BR arm received six cycles of BR. The study included 389 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, with or without 17p deletion, who had been previously treated with at least one line of therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan or BR. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, overall response rate and complete response rate (with or without complete blood count recovery).

About the CLL14 study 5
CLL14 [NCT02242942] is a randomised phase III study evaluating the combination of fixed-duration Venclexta®/Venclyxto® (venetoclax) plus Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® (obinutuzumab) compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil in adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and co-existing medical conditions. 432 patients with previously untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive either a 12-month duration of Venclexta/Venclyxto alongside six-month duration of Gazyva/Gazyvaro (Arm A) or six-month duration of Gazyva/Gazyvaro alongside 12-month duration of chlorambucil (Arm B). Arm A started with an initial dosing of Gazyva/Gazyvaro followed by a five-week Venclexta/Venclyxto dose ramp-up to help reduce the risk of tumour burden. The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed by independent review committee, minimal residual disease (MRD) status, overall response rate, complete response rate (with or without complete blood count recovery), overall survival, duration of response, event-free survival, time to next CLL treatment, and safety. MRD-negativity, or undetectable MRD, means no cancer can be detected using a specific and highly sensitive test, and was defined as less than one cancer cell in 10,000 leukocytes. The CLL14 study is being conducted in cooperation with the German CLL Study Group, headed by Michael Hallek, MD, University of Cologne.

About Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax)
Venclexta®/Venclyxto® is a first-in-class targeted medicine designed to selectively bind and inhibit the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers and other tumours, BCL-2 builds up and prevents cancer cells from dying or self-destructing, a process called apoptosis. Venclexta/Venclyxto blocks the BCL-2 protein and works to restore the process of apoptosis.

Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the US, and commercialised by AbbVie, under the brand name Venclyxto outside of the US. Together, the companies are committed to research with Venclexta/Venclyxto, which is currently being studied in clinical trials across several types of blood and other cancers.

In the US, Venclexta has been granted five Breakthrough Therapy Designations by the US Food and Drug Administration: one for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), two for relapsed or refractory CLL and two for previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia.

About Gazyva/Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab)
Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® is an engineered monoclonal antibody designed to attach to CD20, a protein expressed on certain B-cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells. Gazyva/Gazyvaro is designed to attack and destroy targeted B-cells both directly and together with the body’s immune system.

Gazyva/Gazyvaro is currently approved in more than 90 countries in combination with chlorambucil for people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in more than 80 countries in combination with bendamustine for people with certain types of previously treated follicular lymphoma and in more than 70 countries in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.

Additional combination studies investigating Gazyva/Gazyvaro with other approved or investigational medicines, including cancer immunotherapies and small molecule inhibitors, are underway across a range of blood cancers.

About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukaemia in the Western world. 6 CLL mainly affects men and the median age at diagnosis is about 70 years.7 Worldwide, the incidence of all leukaemias is estimated to be over 400,000, with an incidence of over 100,000 in Europe.[8] CLL is estimated to affect around one-third of all people newly diagnosed with leukaemia.6

 Result: @median follow up (38.1mos.) 44% of patients either remained on treatment or continued to be followed for survival; median DOR (28.6 mos.); estimated DOR rate @36 mos. (41.9%); m-PFS (22 mos.); estimated PFS rate @6mos. (37.2%); presented at ASH
 Calquence is a selective BTK inhibitor, binds BTK thereby inhibiting its activity, and is approved for CLL and SLL in the US and for CLL in the EU and several other countries globally","(WILMINGTON, Del.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Long-term follow-up results from the positive ACE-LY-004 Phase II trial showed patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) treated with CALQUENCE® (acalabrutinib) remained progression free for a median of 22 months, with median overall survival not yet reached at three years of follow-up. The safety and tolerability profile remained consistent.1 This data was presented at the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition on 6 December 2020.

MCL is typically an aggressive, rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that accounts for nearly 6% of all NHL cases and is mostly found in males during their early sixties.2,3

At a median follow up of 38.1 months (range: 0.3-59.5), 55 patients (44%) either remained on treatment (24 patients) or continued to be followed for survival (31 patients). The safety profile remained largely unchanged from the last analysis at 26 months, with only 14 patients (11%) having discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs).1

Michael L. Wang, MD, Professor, Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and principal investigator of the ACE-LY-004 Phase II trial, said: “Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive, difficult-to-treat blood cancer that is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage and often becomes resistant to treatment. This data shows that patients treated with acalabrutinib experienced deep responses over time, while the safety profile remained largely the same, including low rates of Grade 3/4 events, cardiac events and bleeding events, which are important in this patient population.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “These results add to the mounting evidence that CALQUENCE can provide sustained responses in patients over more than three years. CALQUENCE is an important chemo-free treatment option for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and is rapidly being embraced across the clinical and patient community.”

Additionally, an exploratory analysis of 30 patients meeting the criteria for minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation showed six patients (20%) achieved a complete response and undetectable MRD (uMRD) and maintained uMRD at last assessment.1

AEs in the trial remained largely unchanged with an additional year of follow up. The most frequent AEs of any grade (greater than or equal to 20% of patients) included headache (39%), diarrhea (37%), fatigue (30%), cough (23%), myalgia (22%) and nausea (22%), and were primarily Grade 1/2. Grade 3/4 AEs included neutropenia (11%), anemia (10%) and pneumonia (6%).1

Overall, 16 patients (13%) had cardiac AEs (11 with prior cardiac risk factors), with three of the 16 cardiac AEs occurring in the last year of follow up (two were Grade 3/4). Overall, six patients (5%) had Grade 3/4 cardiac AEs. One patient had Grade 3/4 hypertension in the last year (total any grade, n=5 [4%]; total Grade 3/4, n=2 [2%]), and five patients had bleeding AEs in the last year (total any grade, n=46 [37%]). Three patients had Grade 3/4 infections in the last year.1

Initial results from the ACE-LY-004 Phase II trial were presented on 9 December 2017 at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition and served as the basis for the first FDA approval of CALQUENCE in adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy.4 CALQUENCE is approved for this indication in many other countries. The US MCL indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

INDICATION AND USAGE

CALQUENCE is a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

CALQUENCE is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT CALQUENCE® (acalabrutinib) capsules

Serious and Opportunistic Infections

Fatal and serious infections, including opportunistic infections, have occurred in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE.

Serious or Grade 3 or higher infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal) occurred in 19% of 1029 patients exposed to CALQUENCE in clinical trials, most often due to respiratory tract infections (11% of all patients, including pneumonia in 6%). These infections predominantly occurred in the absence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, with neutropenic infection reported in 1.9% of all patients. Opportunistic infections in recipients of CALQUENCE have included, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus reactivation, fungal pneumonia, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, cytomegalovirus, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Consider prophylaxis in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat promptly.

Hemorrhage

Fatal and serious hemorrhagic events have occurred in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE. Major hemorrhage (serious or Grade 3 or higher bleeding or any central nervous system bleeding) occurred in 3.0% of patients, with fatal hemorrhage occurring in 0.1% of 1029 patients exposed to CALQUENCE in clinical trials. Bleeding events of any grade, excluding bruising and petechiae, occurred in 22% of patients.

Use of antithrombotic agents concomitantly with CALQUENCE may further increase the risk of hemorrhage. In clinical trials, major hemorrhage occurred in 2.7% of patients taking CALQUENCE without antithrombotic agents and 3.6% of patients taking CALQUENCE with antithrombotic agents. Consider the risks and benefits of antithrombotic agents when co-administered with CALQUENCE. Monitor patients for signs of bleeding.

Consider the benefit-risk of withholding CALQUENCE for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.

Cytopenias

Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (23%), anemia (8%), thrombocytopenia (7%), and lymphopenia (7%), developed in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE. Grade 4 neutropenia developed in 12% of patients. Monitor complete blood counts regularly during treatment. Interrupt treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue treatment as warranted.

Second Primary Malignancies

Second primary malignancies, including skin cancers and other solid tumors, occurred in 12% of 1029 patients exposed to CALQUENCE in clinical trials. The most frequent second primary malignancy was skin cancer, reported in 6% of patients. Monitor patients for skin cancers and advise protection from sun exposure.

Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter

Grade 3 atrial fibrillation or flutter occurred in 1.1% of 1029 patients treated with CALQUENCE, with all grades of atrial fibrillation or flutter reported in 4.1% of all patients. The risk may be increased in patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, previous arrhythmias, and acute infection. Monitor for symptoms of arrhythmia (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, syncope, dyspnea) and manage as appropriate.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) of any grade in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL were anemia,* thrombocytopenia,* headache (39%), neutropenia,* diarrhea (31%), fatigue (28%), myalgia (21%), and bruising (21%). The most common Grade ≥ 3 non-hematological adverse reaction (reported in at least 2% of patients) was diarrhea (3.2%).

*Treatment-emergent decreases (all grades) of hemoglobin (46%), platelets (44%), and neutrophils (36%) were based on laboratory measurements and adverse reactions.

Dose reductions or discontinuations due to any adverse reaction were reported in 1.6% and 6.5% of patients, respectively. Increases in creatinine 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 4.8% of patients.

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 30%) of any grade in patients with CLL were anemia,* neutropenia,* thrombocytopenia,* headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and diarrhea.

*Treatment-emergent decreases (all grades) of hemoglobin, platelets, and neutrophils were based on laboratory measurements and adverse reactions.

In patients with previously untreated CLL exposed to CALQUENCE, fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 30 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2% for each treatment arm, most often from infection. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 39% of patients in the CALQUENCE plus obinutuzumab arm and 32% in the CALQUENCE monotherapy arm, most often due to events of pneumonia (7% and 2.8%, respectively).

Adverse reactions led to CALQUENCE dose reduction in 7% and 4% of patients in the CALQUENCE plus obinutuzumab arm (N=178) and CALQUENCE monotherapy arm (N=179), respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation in 11% and 10% of patients, respectively. Increases in creatinine 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 3.9% and 2.8% of patients in the CALQUENCE combination arm and monotherapy arm, respectively.

In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL exposed to CALQUENCE, serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients. Serious adverse reactions in > 5% of patients who received CALQUENCE included lower respiratory tract infection (6%). Fatal adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of CALQUENCE occurred in 2.6% of patients, including from second primary malignancies and infection.

Adverse reactions led to CALQUENCE dose reduction in 3.9% of patients (N=154), dose interruptions in 34% of patients, most often due to respiratory tract infections followed by neutropenia, and discontinuation in 10% of patients, most frequently due to second primary malignancies followed by infection. Increases in creatinine 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.3% of patients who received CALQUENCE.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid co-administration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. If a strong CYP3A inhibitor will be used short-term, interrupt CALQUENCE.

Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: When CALQUENCE is co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, reduce CALQUENCE dose to 100 mg once daily.

Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer. If a strong CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided, increase the CALQUENCE dose to 200 mg approximately every 12 hours.

Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: If treatment with a gastric acid reducing agent is required, consider using an H2-receptor antagonist or an antacid. Take CALQUENCE 2 hours before taking an H2-receptor antagonist. Separate dosing with an antacid by at least 2 hours.

Avoid co-administration with proton pump inhibitors. Due to the long-lasting effect of proton pump inhibitors, separation of doses may not eliminate the interaction with CALQUENCE.

SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Based on findings in animals, CALQUENCE may cause fetal harm and dystocia when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CALQUENCE therapy. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CALQUENCE and for at least 1 week following the last dose of CALQUENCE.

It is not known if CALQUENCE is present in human milk. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking CALQUENCE and for at least 2 weeks after the final dose. Avoid administration of CALQUENCE in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Dose modifications are not required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.

Mantle cell lymphoma

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an uncommon type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.5 MCL comprises 3% to 6% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with an annual incidence of 0.5 per 100,000 population in Western countries; in the US, it was estimated that approximately 3,300 new cases of MCL were diagnosed in 2016.5,6 The median age at diagnosis is 68 years, with MCL occurring more often in men than women. While MCL patients initially respond to treatment, there is a high relapse rate.5

ACE-LY-004

ACE-LY-004 is an open-label, single-arm Phase II clinical trial evaluating CALQUENCE in adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.7 Adults with MCL and ECOG PS ≤2 who had relapsed or were refractory to 1-5 prior therapies, had no prior BTK/BCL-2 inhibitor exposure, and did not require warfarin/vitamin K antagonists, received oral CALQUENCE 100mg twice-daily until progressive disease or toxicity. Overall response rate (investigator-assessed partial response or better per Lugano classification), duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety were assessed. Minimal residual disease was analyzed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and peripheral blood by next-generation sequencing (5×10-6) in patients with available paired samples.1

CALQUENCE

CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) is a next-generation, selective inhibitor of BTK. CALQUENCE binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.4,8 In B-cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.4

CALQUENCE is approved for the treatment of CLL and SLL in the US and is approved for CLL in the EU and several other countries worldwide. CALQUENCE is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy in the US and several other countries. CALQUENCE is not currently approved for the treatment of MCL in Europe.

As part of an extensive clinical development program, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating CALQUENCE in more than 20 company-sponsored clinical trials. CALQUENCE is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, follicular lymphoma, and other hematologic malignancies.

53255,Roche Presents Results of Hemlibra Reinforcing the Long-Term Benefits for Hemophilia A at ASH 2020,New follow-up phase III data reinforce the long-term benefit of Roche’s Hemlibra for people with haemophilia A,"The 4 pivotal HAVEN studies (HAVEN-1, 2, 3, 4) included pooled data from 401 people with hemophilia A with/ out factor VIII inhibitors, with a median duration efficacy period of 120.4wks.
 Hemlibra maintained low treated bleed rates with ABR remaining low throughout the evaluation period at 1.4. The proportion of participants who experienced 0 treated bleeds (70.8-83.7%) increased with each consecutive 24wks. period
 Roche also presented the first interim analysis of the EUHASS database suggesting that the safety profile of Hemlibra in the real-world setting is consistent with the clinical trials, with no new/ emerging safety signals. Hemlibra is a bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed Ab","Basel, 7 December 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced results from a new analysis of pooled, three-year follow-up data of 401 people with haemophilia A from the pivotal HAVEN 1-4 studies, which reinforce the long-term efficacy and safety profile of Hemlibra® (emicizumab).[1] These data, from adults, adolescents and children with haemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors, were presented at the all-virtual 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, 5-8 December 2020.

“The long-term benefit of Hemlibra, with a consistent safety profile and durably effective control of bleeding, underscores its potential to redefine the standard of care for people living with haemophilia A,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “As the first new class of medicine in nearly 20 years, Hemlibra continues to show a positive impact on disease burden and quality of life for people with haemophilia A, regardless of their inhibitor status or age.”

The analysis included pooled data from 401 people with haemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors, from across the four pivotal HAVEN studies (HAVEN 1, n=113; HAVEN 2, n=88; HAVEN 3, n=152; HAVEN 4, n=48) with a median duration efficacy period of 120.4 weeks.[1] Hemlibra maintained low treated bleed rates across the study period, with model based annualised bleed rates (ABR) remaining low throughout the evaluation period at 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.7). Further, the proportion of participants who experienced zero treated bleeds (70.8-83.7%) increased with each consecutive 24-week period.[1] In addition, with Hemlibra prophylaxis, 95.1% of target joints were resolved.[1] Results showed that Hemlibra’s safety profile was consistent with previous observations and no new safety signals were observed after the longer follow-up.

Furthermore, the first interim analysis of the European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance (EUHASS) Database, also presented at the ASH Virtual Congress, suggests the safety profile of Hemlibra in the real-world setting is consistent with that seen in clinical trials, with no new or emerging safety signals. EUHASS is a large pharmacovigilance programme that monitors the safety of treatments for inherited bleeding disorders.[2]

Data from the HAVEN studies supported Hemlibra approvals to treat people with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in more than 90 countries worldwide and for people without factor VIII inhibitors in more than 80 countries worldwide, including the US, EU and Japan. Since its initial approval more than three years ago, 8,200 people have received Hemlibra globally, and in the US, Hemlibra is now the most prescribed preventative (prophylactic) treatment for haemophilia A.

About the Hemlibra clinical development programme
Hemlibra has been studied in one of the largest pivotal clinical trial programmes in haemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors, including eight phase III studies. The programme assesses the efficacy and safety of Hemlibra and its potential to help overcome current clinical challenges in the management of haemophilia A, including the short-lasting effects of existing treatments, the development of factor VIII inhibitors and the need for frequent venous access. Results from the HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2 studies supported approvals of Hemlibra for people with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with factor VIII inhibitors. These data, as well as results from the HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4 studies supported approvals of Hemlibra for people with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) without factor VIII inhibitors. Additional studies, HAVEN 5, HAVEN 6, HAVEN 7 and STASEY, reflect Roche’s ongoing commitment to continuing to characterise the safety and efficacy of Hemlibra and to addressing unmet needs for people living with haemophilia A.

About Hemlibra® (emicizumab)
Hemlibra is a bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody. It is designed to bring together factor IXa and factor X, proteins involved in the natural coagulation cascade, and restore the blood clotting process for people with haemophilia A. Hemlibra is a prophylactic (preventative) treatment that can be administered by an injection of a ready-to-use solution under the skin (subcutaneously) once-weekly, every two weeks or every four weeks (after an initial once-weekly dose for the first four weeks). Hemlibra was created by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and is being co-developed globally by Chugai, Roche and Genentech. It is marketed in the United States by Genentech as Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh), with kxwh as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration.

About haemophilia A
Haemophilia A is an inherited, serious disorder in which a person’s blood does not clot properly, leading to uncontrolled and often spontaneous bleeding. Haemophilia A affects around 320,000 people worldwide,[3,4] approximately 50-60% of whom have a severe form of the disorder.[5] People with haemophilia A either lack or do not have enough of a clotting protein called factor VIII. In a healthy person, when a bleed occurs, factor VIII brings together the clotting factors IXa and X, which is a critical step in the formation of a blood clot to help stop bleeding. Depending on the severity of their disorder, people with haemophilia A can bleed frequently, especially into their joints or muscles.[3] These bleeds can present a significant health concern as they often cause pain and can lead to chronic swelling, deformity, reduced mobility, and long-term joint damage.[6] A serious complication of treatment is the development of inhibitors to factor VIII replacement therapies.[7] Inhibitors are antibodies developed by the body’s immune system that bind to and block the efficacy of replacement factor VIII,[8] making it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a level of factor VIII sufficient to control bleeding.

 Result: @48.9mos. CR rate (42.5% vs 17.5%); m-PFS (9.2 vs 3.7 mos.); m-OS (12.4 vs 4.7 mos.); New data from the extension cohort, in 37 patients with 2L DLBCL showed Polivy + BR is effective across a broad range of patients and showed m-PFS (6.6 mos.); median OS (12.5 mos.)
 Sub-group analyses showed that combination was effective in different patient populations with the results from the pooled Polivy + BR arms achieving an m-OS of 7.6mos. in primary refractory patients and 32.0mos. in non-primary refractory patients","Basel, 07 December 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced longer-term data from the pivotal phase Ib/II GO29365 study, including data from a single-arm extension cohort of 106 additional patients, which show the benefit of Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin) plus bendamustine and MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab) (BR) in people with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. Updated data from the randomised cohort (n=80) show that with longer follow-up (48.9 months) a complete response (CR) rate of 42.5% (n=17/40) was maintained in patients following completion of treatment with Polivy plus BR, compared to 17.5% (n=7/40) with BR alone, indicating responses to the Polivy regimen were durable. No new or delayed safety signals were reported. Furthermore, new data from an extension cohort showed a CR rate of 38.7% (n=41/106) with Polivy plus BR. These results, which were presented as a poster (Abstract #3020) at the all-virtual 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition on 5-8 December 2020, further support the clinical benefit this Polivy-based combination brings to patients with this aggressive disease.

“Despite recent advances, treatment options are needed that can improve survival outcomes, enhance convenience, and support a good quality of life for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are encouraged by the continued survival benefit seen with this Polivy combination across a broad range of patients, which reinforces the positive impact that this off-the-shelf treatment option could have for people with this aggressive disease.”

Additional data from the randomised cohort also show that the survival benefit with Polivy plus BR persisted with longer follow-up. After 48.9 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.2 months with Polivy plus BR, versus 3.7 months for BR alone, as assessed by an independent review committee. Median overall survival (OS) was also sustained at 12.4 months for Polivy plus BR compared to 4.7 months for BR alone. New data from the extension cohort, which included 37 patients with second-line DLBCL were consistent with previously reported results from the GO29365 study, and show Polivy plus BR is effective in a broad range of patients. The median PFS was 6.6 months and median OS was 12.5 months with the Polivy combination. Sub-group analyses of this cohort also show that Polivy plus BR was effective in different patient populations, including high-risk patients, regardless of prior lines of therapy, with results from the pooled Polivy plus BR arms achieving a median OS of 7.6 months in primary refractory patients (n=55), and 32.0 months in non-primary refractory patients (n=97).

Based on initial results from the GO29365 study, in January 2020 Polivy was granted conditional marketing authorisation by the European Commission in combination with bendamustine and MabThera for the treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL, who are not candidates for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant. Prior to this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval of Polivy in combination with BR for the treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL, who have received at least two prior therapies. Beyond R/R disease, Polivy is also being investigated in first-line DLBCL, with results from the phase III POLARIX trial anticipated in 2021. Other ongoing studies include combinations of Polivy with Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® (obinutuzumab), Venclexta®/Venclyxto® (venetoclax) and CD20xCD3 bispecific antibodies mosunetuzumab and glofitamab to identify areas where Polivy has the potential to deliver benefit in areas of unmet need.

About the GO29365 study
GO29365 [NCT02257567] is a global, phase Ib/II study evaluating the safety, tolerability and activity of Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin) in combination with bendamustine and MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab) (BR) or Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® (obinutuzumab) in relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Eligible patients were not candidates for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant at study entry. The phase II part of the study randomised 80 patients with heavily pre-treated R/R DLBCL to receive either BR, or BR in combination with Polivy for a fixed duration of six 21-day cycles. Of the patients enrolled, 80% had refractory disease. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) at the end of treatment, as measured by positron emission tomography and assessed by an independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR; CR and partial response) by investigator assessment and best ORR at the end of treatment by investigator and IRC assessment. Exploratory endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, event-free survival and overall survival. In addition to the randomised cohort of the study, an additional 106 patients were treated with Polivy plus BR in a single-arm extension cohort, also with CR as the primary endpoint.

About Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin)
Polivy is a first-in-class anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The CD79b protein is expressed specifically in the majority of B-cells (an immune cell impacted in some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)), making it a promising target for the development of new therapies.[1,2] Polivy binds to CD79b and destroys these B-cells through the delivery of an anti-cancer agent, which is thought to minimise the effects on normal cells.[3,4] Polivy is being developed by Roche using Seattle Genetics ADC technology and is currently being investigated for the treatment of NHL. Polivy is marketed in the US by Genentech as Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq), with piiq as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
DLBCL is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for about one in three cases of NHL.[5] DLBCL is an aggressive (fast-growing) type of NHL, which is generally responsive to treatment in the frontline.[6] However, as many as 40% of patients will relapse, at which time salvage therapy options are limited and survival is short.[6] Approximately 150,000 people worldwide are estimated to be diagnosed with DLBCL each year.[7]

Additionally, real-world data indicate low biomarker testing rates for these patients","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., Dec. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), today announced results from a long-term integrated analysis of two Phase 3 clinical studies and additional pooled analysis evaluating the effect of IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) based therapies for the first-line treatment of high-risk patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The totality of data featured at the virtual 2020 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting continues to establish the treatment benefit of IMBRUVICA for CLL patients with or without high-risk disease.

Results from an integrated analysis of two Phase 3 clinical trials (RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE) with up to 6.5 years of long-term follow-up investigating the use of IMBRUVICA-based therapies in patients with CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with first-line treatment showed similar progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rates (ORR) in patients with or without high-risk genomic features (Abstract #2220).1 

“We’re excited to present long-term follow-up results at the ASH congress across multiple studies, including our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE, which showed continued PFS and ORR benefits across high-risk patients with previously untreated CLL,” said Danelle James, M.D., M.A.S., IMBRUVICA Clinical Development Lead, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.

Additionally, a pooled analysis across four clinical trials with up to 8 years of follow-up, including three Phase 3 studies (RESONATE-2, iLLUMINATE, E1912), and the Phase 2 PCYC-1122e study – sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) – showed that first-line treatment with IMBRUVICA-based therapies resulted in sustained, long-term efficacy with high 4-year PFS rates in high-risk CLL patients, defined as del(17p) or TP53 gene mutations (Abstract 2219).2

“The presence of del(17p) or TP53 gene mutation is a strong negative predictor of survival in patients with CLL, and testing for these markers is important so patients receive optimal therapy,” said John Allan, M.D., assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and principal study investigator of the pooled analysis. “Although these patients remain at risk for disease progression, first-line treatment with ibrutinib based therapy may meaningfully improve the poor prognosis in this high-risk population.”

The informCLL™ real-world prospective observational registry assessing treatment patterns will be featured in an oral presentation. Data from this real-world evidence study showed low testing rates for prognostic and biomarker features among patients with CLL.3 Further, when biomarker testing was performed, the selection of chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) continued for a considerable proportion of patients with del(17p)/TP53 mutational status, which is inconsistent with current guidelines (Abstract 547).4 As well, a retrospective, chart review study of real world patients featured as an oral presentation examined treatment patterns and time to next treatment (TTNT) in patients with CLL. Results showed high-risk patients with CLL treated with IMBRUVICA monotherapy had longer TTNT than those treated with CIT, and that IMBRUVICA therapy showed similar results in high risk and non-high-risk patients (Abstract 372).4

Abstract #2220: Outcomes of First-Line Ibrutinib in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and High-Risk Genomic Features With up to 6.5 Years Follow-up: Integrated Analysis of Two Phase 3 Studies (RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE)

Poster Presentation: Sunday, December 6, 2020 at 7:00 a.m. PST

Data were presented from an integrated analysis of two Phase 3 studies evaluating IMBRUVICA-based therapy in the first-line treatment of CLL/SLL (RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE) to better understand outcomes in patients with various high-risk genomic features, including integrated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cytogenetics and single gene mutations.

In RESONATE-2 (NCT01722487), patients aged ≥65 years without del(17p) were randomized to single-agent IMBRUVICA or chlorambucil. In iLLUMINATE (NCT02264574), patients aged ≥65 years, or <65 years with coexisting conditions or del(17p)/TP53 mutation, were randomized to IMBRUVICA plus obinutuzumab or chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab. The integrated analysis included 498 patients treated with first-line IMBRUVICA -based or chlorambucil-based therapy (n=249 each) with a median follow-up of 49.1 months. At 42 months, PFS rates were higher across high-risk genomic subgroups in patients treated with IMBRUVICA (63 to 82 percent) compared to those receiving chlorambucil with or without obinutuzumab (6 to 34 percent), and consistent PFS benefit with IMBRUVICA was observed across all high-risk genomic subgroups.1 When comparing IMBRUVICA-treated patients with specific high-risk genomic features versus those without, results showed that PFS and ORR were comparable in the different subgroups, including patients with unmutated versus mutated immunoglobin heavy chain variable (IGHV) (PFS Hazard Ratio [HR], 1.79, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.99-3.24) or mutated versus not mutated NOTCH1 (PFS HR, 1.05, 95% CI 0.65-1.69). 1 Results also showed improved outcomes for patients with del(17p)/TP53 mutated/BIRC3 mutated, the highest risk category (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54-2.04). 1,[5]

At a median duration of IMBRUVICA treatment of 35.7 to 43.8 months across these high-risk subgroups, there were no meaningful differences in the rates of treatment-emergent AEs of any grade or Grade 3 or higher AEs compared to those of the overall population. 1

Abstract #2219: Long-Term Efficacy of First-Line Ibrutinib Treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) With 4 Years of Follow-Up in Patients With TP53 Aberrations (del(17p) or TP53 mutation): a Pooled Analysis from 4 Clinical Trials

Poster Presentation: Sunday, December 6, 2020 at 7:00 a.m. PST

A pooled analysis of data across four studies to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of first-line IMBRUVICA-based therapy in patients with CLL bearing TP53 aberrations were presented. Eighty-nine patients with TP53 aberrations receiving first-line IMBRUVICA treatment were included in this pooled analysis. Median age was 65 years, and 69 percent of patients were male. Forty-five patients received IMBRUVICA as a single agent and 44 patients received IMBRUVICA in combination with an anti-CD20 agent.2

At 48 months, the PFS rate was 79 percent among these high-risk patients treated with IMBRUVICA-based therapy. 2 Median duration of IMBRUVICA treatment was 46 months. With a median follow-up of 50 months, median PFS was not reached (95% CI: 67 months to not estimable). 2

At the current follow-up, 46 percent of patients with TP53 aberrations remained on IMBRUVICA treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were progressive disease (20 percent), study closure (12 percent), adverse events (AEs; 10 percent), withdrawal by patient (7 percent), death (3 percent), and other (1 percent). 2

Grade 3 or greater AEs of clinical interest with up to 8 years of treatment with IMBRUVICA were infection (22 percent), most commonly pneumonia (7 percent); hypertension (13 percent), atrial fibrillation (12 percent), and major hemorrhage (7 percent).2

Abstract #547: Real-World Prognostic Biomarker Testing, Treatment Patterns, and Dosing Among 1,461 Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) from the informCLL™ Prospective Observational Registry

Oral Presentation: Monday, December 7, 2020 at 8:15 a.m. PST

Results from the informCLL™ real-world prospective observational registry assessing treatment patterns in the era of novel agents were presented in an oral session.

The registry fully enrolled with 1,461 patients, of whom 855 (59 percent) were previously untreated and 606 (41 percent) were relapsed/refractory.4 Community-based practices enrolled 93 percent of the patients. 4 Patient demographics include a median age of 71 years; majority were male (64 percent), and 88 percent had an ECOG performance statue of 0/1.4 Median follow-up for previously untreated patients was 14.9 months and 15.3 months for relapsed/refractory patients.4

Results showed the most common index treatment was IMBRUVICA; and CIT was the next most widely used treatment regimen for one-third of patients.4 Data also showed that prognostic biomarker testing rates were poor, especially for TP53 and IGHV mutational status.4 Data from the informCLL study also indicates a ‘knowledge gap’ in terms of importance of prognostic marker testing and appropriate selection of therapies for patients with high-risk disease.4

Abstract #372: Clinical Outcomes Among Real-World Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Initiating First-Line Ibrutinib or Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) Stratified by Risk Status: Results from a US Retrospective Chart Review Study

Oral Presentation: Sunday, December 6, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. PST

Results from a retrospective study comparing clinical outcomes in high-risk and non-high-risk patients with CLL receiving IMBRUVICA compared to those receiving chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) as first-line therapy were presented.

The analysis was performed by evaluating medical records from more than 40 U.S. clinical practices, included 271 patients with high-risk disease and 245 patients with non-high-risk CLL.3 Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were balanced within each pair of comparison groups. 3 The median (range) follow-up for high-risk patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to CIT was 33.3 versus 35.3 months, respectively.3 Additionally, the median (range) duration of first-line therapy for patients treated with IMBRUVICA was 28.6 months compared to 5.5 months for patients treated with CIT. 3

The weighted analysis showed that high-risk patients treated with IMBRUVICA had significantly longer median TTNT and were 54 percent less likely to start a new treatment compared to high-risk patients treated with CIT (HR [95% CI]: 0.46 [0.34-0.62], p<0.01).3 During the available follow-up, more weighted high-risk patients treated with IMBRUVICA had only one line of treatment compared to weighted high-risk patients treated with CIT (74.7% vs 47.2%, respectively); more non-high-risk CIT patients had only one line of treatment compared to high-risk CIT patients (69.9% vs 45.8%, respectively); and more non-high-risk IMBRUVICA patients had only one line of treatment compared to high-risk IMBRUVICA patients (91.5% vs 81.7%, respectively).

Additionally, the majority of patients received a small molecular inhibitor therapy as second-line treatment. The most common second-line agents were IMBRUVICA monotherapy in the CIT groups (high-risk: 86.5%; non-HR: 83.7%) and venetoclax in the patients treated with first-line IMBRUVICA, either as monotherapy (high-risk: 37.5%; non-high-risk: 28.6%) or in combination with rituximab (high-risk: 28.1%; non-high-risk: 28.6%).

Results from the Kaplan-Meyer analysis showed that weighted high-risk IMBRUVICA patients had significantly longer median TTNT and were 54 percent less likely to start a new treatment compared to high-risk CIT patients (HR 95% CI: 0.46 [0.34-0.62]; p<0.01). For the high-risk patients receiving CIT versus non-high-risk patients receiving CIT, high-risk patients had a significantly shorter median TTNT and were 2.43 times more likely to start a new treatment (HR [95% CI]: 2.43 [1.58-3.47]; p<0.01). 3 No significant differences were noted in TTNT between high-risk and non-high-risk groups receiving IMBRUVICA, with median TTNT not reached (HR [95% CI]: 2.2 [0.96-4.96]; p=0.06). 3

About IMBRUVICA

IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) is an oral, once-daily medicine that works differently than chemotherapy as it blocks a protein called Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). The BTK protein sends important signals that tell B cells to mature and produce antibodies. BTK signaling is needed by specific cancer cells to multiply and spread.6,7 By blocking BTK, IMBRUVICA may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environments in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.8

Since its launch in 2013, IMBRUVICA has received 11 FDA approvals across six disease areas: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with or without 17p deletion (del17p); small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with or without del17p; Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM); previously-treated patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)*; previously-treated patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy* – and previously-treated patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy.9

IMBRUVICA is now approved in more than 100 countries and has been used to treat more than 200,000 patients worldwide across its approved indications. IMBRUVICA is the only FDA-approved medicine in WM and cGVHD. IMBRUVICA has been granted four Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA. This designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases. IMBRUVICA was one of the first medicines to receive FDA approval via the Breakthrough Therapy Designation pathway.

In early 2019, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN® ), a not-for-profit alliance of 28 leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education, recommends ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA) as a preferred regimen for the initial treatment of CLL/SLL. In February 2020, the NCCN Guidelines® were updated to elevate IMBRUVICA with or without rituximab from other recommended regimens to a preferred regimen for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL. In September 2020, the NCCN guidelines were updated to elevate IMBRUVICA with or without rituximab as the only Category 1 preferred regimen for treatment-naïve WM patients.

IMBRUVICA is being studied alone and in combination with other treatments in several blood and solid tumor cancers and other serious illnesses. IMBRUVICA is the most comprehensively studied BTK inhibitor, with more than 150 ongoing clinical trials. There are approximately 30 ongoing company-sponsored trials, 10 of which are in Phase 3, and more than 100 investigator-sponsored trials and external collaborations that are active around the world. For more information, visit www.IMBRUVICA.com.

*Accelerated approval was granted for the MCL and MZL indications based on overall response rate. Continued approval for MCL and MZL may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. IMBRUVICA® can harm your unborn baby. If you are able to become pregnant, your healthcare provider will do a pregnancy test before starting treatment with IMBRUVICA®. Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment with IMBRUVICA®.
Females who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with IMBRUVICA® and for 1 month after the last dose.
Males with female partners who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control, such as condoms, during treatment with IMBRUVICA® and for 1 month after the last dose.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Do not breastfeed during treatment with IMBRUVICA® and for 1 week after the last dose.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Taking IMBRUVICA® with certain other medicines may affect how IMBRUVICA® works and can cause side effects.

How should I take IMBRUVICA®?

Take IMBRUVICA® exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it.
Take IMBRUVICA® 1 time a day.
Swallow IMBRUVICA® capsules or tablets whole with a glass of water.
Do not open, break or chew IMBRUVICA® capsules.
Do not cut, crush or chew IMBRUVICA® tablets.
Take IMBRUVICA® at about the same time each day.
If you miss a dose of IMBRUVICA® take it as soon as you remember on the same day. Take your next dose of IMBRUVICA® at your regular time on the next day. Do not take extra doses of IMBRUVICA® to make up for a missed dose.
If you take too much IMBRUVICA® call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.
What should I avoid while taking IMBRUVICA®?

You should not drink grapefruit juice, eat grapefruit, or eat Seville oranges (often used in marmalades) during treatment with IMBRUVICA®. These products may increase the amount of IMBRUVICA® in your blood.
What are the possible side effects of IMBRUVICA®?

IMBRUVICA® may cause serious side effects, including:

Bleeding problems (hemorrhage) are common during treatment with IMBRUVICA®, and can also be serious and may lead to death. Your risk of bleeding may increase if you are also taking a blood thinner medicine. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any signs of bleeding, including: blood in your stools or black stools (looks like tar), pink or brown urine, unexpected bleeding, or bleeding that is severe or that you cannot control, vomit blood or vomit looks like coffee grounds, cough up blood or blood clots, increased bruising, dizziness, weakness, confusion, change in your speech, or a headache that lasts a long time or severe headache.
Infections can happen during treatment with IMBRUVICA®. These infections can be serious and may lead to death. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever, chills, weakness, confusion, or other signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with IMBRUVICA®.
Decrease in blood cell counts. Decreased blood counts (white blood cells, platelets, and red blood cells) are common with IMBRUVICA®, but can also be severe. Your healthcare provider should do monthly blood tests to check your blood counts.
Heart rhythm problems (ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter). Serious heart rhythm problems and death have happened in people treated with IMBRUVICA®, especially in people who have an increased risk for heart disease, have an infection, or who have had heart rhythm problems in the past. Tell your healthcare provider if you get any symptoms of heart rhythm problems, such as feeling as if your heart is beating fast and irregular, lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or you faint. If you develop any of these symptoms, your healthcare provider may do a test to check your heart (ECG) and may change your IMBRUVICA® dose.
High blood pressure (hypertension). New or worsening high blood pressure has happened in people treated with IMBRUVICA®. Your healthcare provider may start you on blood pressure medicine or change current medicines to treat your blood pressure.
Second primary cancers. New cancers have happened during treatment with IMBRUVICA®, including cancers of the skin or other organs.
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause kidney failure and the need for dialysis treatment, abnormal heart rhythm, seizure, and sometimes death. Your healthcare provider may do blood tests to check you for TLS.
The most common side effects of IMBRUVICA® in adults with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL/SLL, WM and MZL) include:

diarrhea
tiredness
muscle and bone pain
rash
bruising
The most common side effects of IMBRUVICA® in adults with cGVHD include:

tiredness
bruising
diarrhea
mouth sores (stomatitis)
muscle spasms
nausea
pneumonia
Diarrhea is a common side effect in people who take IMBRUVICA®. Drink plenty of fluids during treatment with IMBRUVICA® to help reduce your risk of losing too much fluid (dehydration) due to diarrhea. Tell your healthcare provider if you have diarrhea that does not go away.

These are not all the possible side effects of IMBRUVICA®. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

 NKTR-255 is being tested in a P-Ib/II study as monothx. & in combination with rituximab or daratumumab in patients with MM & NHL and being evaluated in a P-Ib/II trial in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of colorectal cancer & HNSCC
 NKTR-255 is an IL-15 receptor agonist designed to activate the IL-15 pathway & expand NK cell, promoting the survival & expansion of memory CD8+ T cells without inducing suppressive regulatory T cells","SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NKTR) today announced two nonclinical data presentations for NKTR-255, its IL-15 pathway agonist, at the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. The presentations include an oral presentation of translational research studies conducted in collaboration with researchers from Dana-Farber Cancer Center.

NKTR-255 is an interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist that is designed to expand both natural killer (NK) cells and memory CD8 T cell populations. It is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical studies in both hematological and solid tumors in combination with agents that induce antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC). In the hematological setting, NKTR-255 is being tested in a Phase 1b/2 clinical study as monotherapy and in combination with rituximab or daratumumab in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). It is also being evaluated in a Phase 1b/2 solid tumor trial in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

“Inhibition of NK cell effector functions is a mechanism for immune evasion in patients with multiple myeloma and therefore restoring and enhancing NK cell functionality is a key goal for new immunotherapeutic approaches, ” said Nikhil C. Munshi, MD, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Director of Basic and Correlative Science, and Associate Director of the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “In our studies, we found the novel IL-15 receptor agonist, NKTR-255, was effective in reverting the inhibitory status observed in NK cells from MM patients, leading to enhanced direct NK cytotoxicity against several MM cell lines and primary MM cells. In addition, we saw a significant increase in ADCC activity in vitro with NKTR-255 in combination with myeloma-targeting antibodies as compared to activity with those antibodies alone. These data accentuate the potential for NKTR-255 as an innovative immunotherapeutic agent in the treatment of multiple myeloma.”

“The ASH presentations add to the growing body of data for NKTR-255 that highlight its ability to enhance NK cell effector function and greatly potentiate the ADCC mechanisms of targeted antibodies,” said Jonathan Zalevsky, Ph.D., Chief Research & Development Officer at Nektar. “We are excited about the development potential of NKTR-255, especially as we’ve already observed biological activity in the first multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients treated in the monotherapy dose-escalation phase of our liquid tumor study.”

Details of the preclinical data presentations at ASH are listed below and are available on the scientific section of Nektar’s website at http://www.nektar.com/science/scientific-posters-and-presentations:

About NKTR-255

NKTR-255 is an IL-15 receptor agonist designed to activate the IL-15 pathway and expand NK cells and promote the survival and expansion of memory CD8+ T cells without inducing suppressive regulatory T cells. Through optimal engagement of the IL-15Rα/IL-2Rβγ receptor complex, NKTR-255 enhances functional NK cell population and formation of long-term immunological memory, which may lead to sustained anti-tumor immune response. NKTR-255 is uniquely designed to overcome the challenges of recombinant IL-15 and other IL-15 agonists, which are rapidly cleared from the body and have shown diminishing response to successive doses.1 NKTR-255 was designed using Nektar’s polymer conjugation technology to extend circulating half-life.

About CAR-T cell therapy

T cells are a type of white blood cell that are critical in eliminating the body of abnormal and cancerous cells in healthy individuals. In cancer patients, these T cells frequently fail to either recognize or effectively engage cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapies involve engineering a human T cell to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that increases its ability to recognize cancer cells. These therapies use the immune system to fight cancer and have the potential to disrupt cancer care and potentially even provide a cure. Mesothelin is a tumor-specific antigen that is commonly expressed at high levels on the cell surface in many aggressive solid tumors and is an attractive target for immune-based therapies, including CAR T therapy.

About Bayer’s new Cell & Gene Therapy (C&GT) Unit

In order to build up its presence in C&GT, Bayer is strengthening its internal C&GT capabilities. At the same time, the company is pursuing external strategic collaborations, technology acquisitions and licensing.

With a high level of flexibility, it will orchestrate operations from science to launch in order to generate and maintain a sustainable pipeline, with the goal to bring new products to market as fast as possible.

About Atara’s Mesothelin CAR-T Franchise

Two of Atara’s investigational CAR T immunotherapy programs, developed in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), target mesothelin—the autologous ATA2271 program and allogeneic ATA3271 program. Mesothelin is a tumor-specific antigen that is commonly expressed at high levels on the cell surface in many aggressive solid tumors including mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer.

Both ATA2271 and ATA3271 are engineered for use in solid tumors as they incorporate Atara’s novel inclusion of both a PD-1 DNR construct to overcome checkpoint inhibition and a 1XX costimulatory domain on the CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) to enhance expansion and functional persistence of the CAR T cells. ATA3271, the allogeneic version of this CAR T, leverages Atara’s EBV T-cell platform and is currently in IND-enabling studies. ATA2271, the autologous version has enrolled the first patient in an open-label, single-arm Phase 1 clinical study in November 2020.

53291,Qiagen Launches QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 RUO Solution for COVID-19,"HILDEN, Germany & GERMANTOWN, Md.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–QIAGEN N.V. (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) announced today the launch of its QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 RUO solution that can detect T-cell responses of the human immune system to the pathogen that causes COVID-19, which could help researchers find out more about immunity levels and disease progression.
 
 Studies suggest that T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 declines much more slowly than antibody response, which presents several benefits to researchers who want to push beyond the existing detection of active infections to screen for potential courses of the illness and long-term immune responses to it. QIAGEN’s QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 Research Use Only (RUO) solution could be a valuable tool in this research.
 
 There is also growing evidence that T-cell response gives a reliable indication of how severe the course of an illness triggered by SARS-CoV-2 will be in infected patients, and how immune those who have recovered remain months – possibly even years – after having been infected.
 
 QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 RUO is a flexible, modular system designed to meet a wide range of research demands. It is based on QIAGEN’s easy-to-use QuantiFERON technology, pioneered in the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test for latent tuberculosis and recognized worldwide for its ability to detect interferon gamma that T-cells release upon contact with certain pathogens.
 
 QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 RUO is a crucial addition to QIAGEN’s growing COVID-19 portfolio that already provides sample-preparation technology, infection testing with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, antibody and antigen tests, enzymes and automation solutions.

53347,Novartis' Asciminib (ABL001) Demonstrate Superiority Over Pfizer's Bosulif in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Trial,Novartis investigational STAMP inhibitor asciminib (ABL001) shows superior MMR rate to Bosulif®* in chronic myeloid leukemia trial,"The P-lll ASCEMBL study involves assessing Asciminib (40mg, bid) vs Bosulif (bosutinib, 500mg, qd) in 223 patients with Ph+ CML-CP prior treated with two or more TKIs and the data were presented at 62nd (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition
 Results: @ 24 wks. MMR rate (25.5% vs 13.2%) tCCyR rate (40.8% vs 24.2%); DMR rate were higher with patients achieving MR4 and MR5(10.8% and 8.9% vs 5.3% and 1.3%); Grade ≥3 AEs (50.6% and 60.5%) respectively, presented at ASH
 The US FDA has granted FT designation for Asciminib while the regulatory submission to the US and EU health authorities is planned for H1’21","Basel, December 8, 2020 — Detailed results from the Phase III ASCEMBL study demonstrate that, at 24 weeks, asciminib (ABL001) – a novel investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP) – nearly doubled the major molecular response (MMR) rate compared to Bosulif® (bosutinib)* (25.5% vs. 13.2%, respectively ([95% CI, 2.19-22.3]; 2-sided P=0.029) in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs)1. These data were presented today at a late-breaking abstracts session during the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition (ASH).

“These important comparative data are impressive, and they reinforce the critical role asciminib may play, if approved, in overcoming the treatment challenges we face in later treatment lines of chronic-phase CML,” said Dr. Michael J. Mauro**, Member and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Program Leader at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Professor at Weill Cornell Medicine. “While the advent and expansion of TKI therapies has resulted in tremendous progress for patients living with CML over the last decades, many of our patients in later treatment lines still face inadequate response, disease progression and intolerable side effects.”

Despite the significant advances in the CML treatment landscape, many patients treated with two or more TKIs experience intolerance; for example, in an analysis of studies in patients who had previously failed two TKIs, up to 55% reported intolerance to treatment8-13. In addition, resistance rates for patients in later treatment lines remain high; and in the second-line setting, at least three out of five patients are unable to achieve MMR and up to 56% of patients do not achieve complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) within two years of follow-up5,13–18. With few remaining treatment options, and no currently established standard-of-care in the third-line setting per treatment guidelines, patients who are resistant or intolerant to two or more TKIs are at a high risk of progression2-5,19-21.

In the ASCEMBL trial, 233 patients were randomized to receive asciminib 40 mg twice daily (n=157) or Bosulif 500 mg once a day (n=76)1. Data showed that, at 24 weeks, more patients achieved a CCyR in the asciminib arm (40.8%) than in the Bosulif arm (24.2%); and deep molecular response (DMR) rates were higher for patients in the asciminib arm than in the Bosulif arm – with 10.8% and 8.9% patients achieving MR4 and MR4.5 on asciminib, respectively, vs. 5.3% and 1.3% on Bosulif1.

Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 50.6% and 60.5% of patients treated with asciminib and Bosulif, respectively1. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs in the asciminib arm was 5.8% compared to 21.1% for patients taking Bosulif 1. Similarly, AEs requiring dose interruption and/or dose adjustments were reported less frequently with asciminib than with Bosulif (37.8% vs. 60.5%, respectively)1. At data cutoff, more patients were still on treatment in the asciminib arm vs. the Bosulif arm (61.8% vs. 30.3%, respectively)1.

The most common grade ≥3 AEs (occurring in >10%) of patients treated with asciminib were thrombocytopenia (17.3%) and neutropenia (14.7%), while for Bosulif they were increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (14.5%), neutropenia (11.8%) and diarrhea (10.5%)1. On-treatment deaths on the asciminib arm occurred in two (1.3%) patients (ischemic stroke and arterial embolism); there was one (1.3%) death on Bosulif (septic shock)1. The most frequent AEs (all grades; ≥20%) were thrombocytopenia (28.8%) and neutropenia (21.8%) in the asciminib arm, compared to diarrhea (71.1%), nausea (46.1%), increased ALT (27.6%), vomiting (26.3%), rash (23.7%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (21.1%), neutropenia (21.1%) and thrombocytopenia (18.4%) in the Bosulif arm1.

“Though some patients with CML may be told they have a ‘good cancer’ because of the wonderful advances in care that have been made over the years, this doesn’t capture the full picture for everyone with the disease,” said Greg Stephens, Executive Director and Founder of the US National CML Society. “The results of the ASCEMBL study are very encouraging to the CML community, and help underscore the crucial need for additional treatment options to address real challenges that patients face.”

Pre-clinical data suggests that asciminib has specificity for BCR-ABL22. Additional data accepted for online publication highlight that, as an investigational STAMP inhibitor, asciminib is designed to help overcome mutations on the ATP-binding site of BCR-ABL1, which may help address resistance in later treatment lines of CML and may potentially address off-target activity22.

“Novartis has been at the forefront of CML research for years – significantly changing the prognosis for patients. We are very proud to once again advance a potentially transformative medicine, a novel STAMP inhibitor, for those who do not adequately respond or are intolerant to currently available TKIs,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “There is a clear need in later lines of therapy, and based on these results, we believe asciminib may become an important new development for patients. We look forward to sharing the data with regulatory authorities and moving forward with submissions worldwide.”

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for asciminib. Submission to the US and EU health authorities is planned for the first half of 2021.

The interim analysis for efficacy was based on ~11,636 participants accruing 131 symptomatic infections from the P-III UK and Brazil trials
 The 1EPs based on the pooling of two dosing regimens showed vaccine is 70.4% effective at preventing COVID-19 occur >14days after receiving 2 doses of the vaccine. 2EPs of prevention demonstrated no cases of severe infections in the vaccine group
 A further analysis showed that vaccine efficacy was 62.1% and 90.0% in participants who received a half dose followed by a full dose. Regulatory submissions are underway to support approval of vaccines","8 December 2020 16:00 GMT
Interim analysis showed vaccine is effective at preventing COVID-19, with no severe cases and no hospitalisations more than 21 days after first injection
Regulatory submissions underway to support approval

Results of an interim analysis of the Phase III programme conducted by Oxford University with AZD1222, peer-reviewed and published in The Lancet today, demonstrated that the vaccine is safe and effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and that it protects against severe disease and hospitalisation. The interim analysis for efficacy was based on 11,636 participants accruing 131 symptomatic infections from the Phase III UK and Brazil trials conducted by Oxford University.

As announced on 23 November 2020, the primary efficacy endpoint of the programme statistical plan, based on the pooling of two dosing regimens, showed that the vaccine is 70.4% (95.8% CI: 54.8% to 80.6%) effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 occurring more than 14 days after receiving two doses of the vaccine. A secondary efficacy endpoint of prevention of severe disease demonstrated no cases of severe infections or hospitalisations in the vaccine group.

A further analysis of the efficacy regimens showed that when the vaccine was given as two full doses, vaccine efficacy was 62.1% (n=8,895; CI 41.0% to 75.7%), and 90.0% (n=2,741; CI 67.4% to 97.0%) in participants who received a half dose followed by a full dose.

Vaccine efficacy was also assessed on the secondary endpoint of early prevention of severe disease after the first dose. There were no hospitalisations or severe cases of COVID-19 more than 21 days after the first dose of the vaccine. Ten participants in the control group were hospitalised due to COVID-19, among whom two were assessed as severe, including one fatal case.

More data will continue to accumulate as part of the upcoming primary analysis and further follow-up, refining the efficacy reading and characterising vaccine efficacy over a longer period of time.

The safety data published so far is from over 20,000 participants enrolled across four clinical trials in the UK (COV001 and COV002), Brazil (COV003) and, in addition, from South Africa (COV005). The Lancet publication confirmed that AZD1222 was well tolerated and that there were no serious safety events confirmed related to the vaccine. The participants were from diverse racial and geographic groups who are healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions. This analysis provides safety data on 74,341 person-months of follow-up after first dose (median 3.4 months) and 29,060 person-months of follow-up after two doses (median 2.0). The overall reported rates of serious adverse events were 0.7% in the vaccine group and 0.8% in the control group.

Professor Andrew Pollard, Director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and Chief Investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said: “Today, we have published the interim analysis of the Phase III trial and show that this new vaccine has a good safety record and efficacy against the coronavirus. We are hugely grateful to our trial volunteers for working with us over the past eight months to bring us to this milestone.”

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “Today’s peer-reviewed publication enables a full disclosure of the Oxford programme interim analysis. The results show that the vaccine is effective against COVID-19, with in particular no severe infections and no hospitalisations in the vaccine group, as well as safe and well tolerated. We have begun submitting data to regulatory authorities around the world for early approval and our global supply chains are up and running, ready to quickly begin delivering hundreds of millions of doses on a global scale at no profit.”

Submission of the data to regulatory authorities around the world has already begun, as part of their ongoing rolling reviews of the vaccine data for temporary use or conditional approval during this health crisis. The Company is also seeking Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization for an accelerated pathway to vaccine availability in low-income countries.

In addition to the Oxford led programme, AstraZeneca is conducting a large study in the US and globally. In total, Oxford University and AstraZeneca expect to enrol more than 60,000 participants globally.

The Company is also making rapid progress in manufacturing with a capacity of up to 3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 on a rolling basis, pending regulatory approval. The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius/ 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered within existing healthcare settings.

AstraZeneca continues to engage with governments, multilateral organisations and collaborators around the world to ensure broad and equitable access to the vaccine at no profit for the duration of the pandemic.

COV001

COV001 is a blinded, multi-centre, randomised, controlled Phase I/II trial assessing safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of AZD1222 in 1,077 healthy adults in five trial centres in the UK. Participants aged 18-55 years are randomised to receive one or two intramuscular doses of AZD1222 at 5×1010 viral particles or comparator, meningococcal vaccine MenACWY. Participants have blood samples drawn and clinical assessments for safety as well as immunogenicity at multiple timepoints up to one year post-vaccination. Weekly COVID-19 PCR testing is performed with retest at 3-5 days post-symptoms onset if the first sample is negative and 7 days after a positive PCR test.

COV002

COV002 is a single-blinded, multi-centre, randomised, controlled Phase II/III trial assessing the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of AZD1222 in 12,390 participants in the UK. Trial participants to date are aged 18 years or over, who are healthy or have medically stable chronic diseases and are at increased risk for being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Participants receive one or two intramuscular doses of a half dose (~2.5 x1010 viral particles) or full dose (~5×1010 viral particles) of AZD1222 or comparator, meningococcal vaccine MenACWY. Participants have blood samples drawn and clinical assessments for safety as well as immunogenicity at multiple timepoints up to one year post-vaccination. Suspected cases presenting with compatible symptoms were tested for virological confirmation by COVID-19 PCR. In addition, weekly swabbing are done for detection of infection and assessment of vaccine efficacy against infection.

COV003

COV003 is a single-blinded, multi-centre, randomised, controlled Phase III trial assessing the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of AZD1222 in 10,300 participants in Brazil. Trial participants to date are aged 18 years or over, who are healthy or have medically stable chronic diseases and are at increased risk for being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Participants are randomised to receive two intramuscular doses of a full dose (~5×1010 viral particles) of AZD1222 or comparator, meningococcal vaccine MenACWY as first dose and a saline placebo as second dose. Participants have blood samples drawn and clinical assessments for safety as well as immunogenicity at multiple timepoints up to one year post-vaccination. Suspected cases presenting with compatible symptoms were tested for virological confirmation by COVID-19 PCR.

COV005

COV005 is a blinded, multi-centre, randomised, controlled Phase I/II trial assessing the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of AZD1222 in 2,070 participants in South Africa. Trial participants are aged 18-65 years, who are living with or without HIV, are randomised to receive two intramuscular doses of AZD1222 at 5-7.5 x1010 viral particles or saline placebo. Participants had blood samples drawn and clinical assessments for safety as well as immunogenicity at multiple timepoints up to one year post-vaccination. Regular COVID-19 PCR testing is performed up to one year post-vaccination.

AZD1222

AZD1222 was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

53358,Medtronic Launches Carpediem as the First Pediatric and Neonatal Acute Dialysis Machine in the US,Medtronic Launches the First and Only Pediatric and Neonatal Acute Dialysis Machine in the U.S.,"Following the US FDA’s approval granted in early 2020, the first Carpediem (Cardio-Renal Pediatric Dialysis Emergency Machine) were installed & use at Cincinnati Children’s HMC in the US
 Carpediem system is indicated for acute kidney injury or fluid overloaded patients requiring hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy
 The system is intended to provide CRRT to patients weighing 2.5 to 10kg","DUBLIN, Dec. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced the U.S. commercial launch of the Carpediem™ Cardio-Renal Pediatric Dialysis Emergency Machine. Following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) marketing authorization, granted earlier this year, the first Carpediem™ systems in the United States were successfully installed and are in use at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. The first of its kind Carpediem™ system is indicated for use in acute kidney injury or fluid overloaded patients requiring hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy. It is intended to provide continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to patients weighing between 2.5 and 10 kilograms.

Critically ill patients are at a high risk for fluid overload and acute kidney injury, conditions in which the kidneys do not function properly in their vital role of filtering waste products and excess fluid from the blood to produce urine. Fluid overload is common in critically ill neonates and children, particularly after procedures such as cardiac surgery. The mortality rate for neonates with acute kidney injury has been reported to be as high as 60 percent.[1]

“CRRT procedures performed for critically ill infants using previously available technology are not optimal largely because dialysis machines available in the U.S. are not designed to treat these small, fragile patients, and can potentially expose them to many risks,” said Stuart L. Goldstein, M.D., professor of pediatrics and director, Center for Acute Care Nephrology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, who has been instrumental in raising awareness of the critical need for safe pediatric-specific dialysis. “This new system is designed specifically for these patients which enables increased precision of neonatal CRRT treatment and, potentially, reduces these risks. We are grateful to be the first site in the U.S. with this technology to help the children in our care.”

CRRT is the most common treatment for critically ill patients whose kidneys are not functioning properly. In this form of renal replacement therapy, the patient’s blood is pumped through a hemofilter to gently remove waste and excess fluid while minimizing the risk for hypotension (low blood pressure) and cardiac stability.

Pediatric patients requiring CRRT have historically been treated with systems designed and indicated for adults and not approved for pediatric use, which can create potential clinical complications for neonatal patients. The Carpediem™ system is intended to address many of the challenges associated with current machines because it is the first CRRT system designed specifically for patients weighing between 2.5 and 10 kilograms. This system was championed by Professor Claudio Ronco, Director, Department of Nephrology and International Renal Research Institute of the San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy (IRRIV).

“At Medtronic, we strive to provide a portfolio of renal care solutions that improve outcomes, access to care, and quality of life for patients affected by severe renal injury or disease globally — no matter their size or age,” said Ven Manda, president, Renal Care Solutions, which is reported as part of the Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. “For the first time, some of the tiniest and most vulnerable patients can be treated with technology designed specifically for them. We cannot make the world a healthier place alone. That is why collaboration with clinical experts, such as Prof. Ronco and Dr. Goldstein, is critical to bringing new treatment options to underserved populations.”

53364,Amgen's Sotorasib Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C Mutation,Amgen’s Sotorasib Granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation For Advanced Or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With KRAS G12C Mutation,"The BT designation is based on P-II CodeBreaK 100 study assessing Sotorasib in patients with advanced NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation whose cancer had progressed despite prior treatment with CT and/or immunotherapy
 The company is currently recruiting in a P-III study (CodeBreaK 200) assessing sotorasib vs docetaxel in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. Amgen has several P-Ib combination studies across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment
 Sotorasib has also accepted into FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review Pilot Program. Additionally, the company plans to submit the NDA to the US FDA by the end of 2020'","THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Dec. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for its investigational KRASG12C inhibitor, sotorasib, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation, as determined by an FDA-approved test, following at least one prior systemic therapy.

“For more than 40 years, scientists have been trying to target KRAS. Today’s news is a welcome update for the many non-small cell lung cancer patients with the KRAS G12C mutation, who currently have no targeted therapies,” said Bonnie J. Addario, cofounder and board chair of the GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer. “We are pleased that the FDA and Amgen recognize the unmet need for these patients and are working to make new treatment options available as quickly as possible.”

KRAS G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC.1,2 In the U.S., about 13% of patients with NSCLC adenocarcinoma harbor the KRAS G12C mutation3 and each year approximately 25,000 new patients in the U.S. are diagnosed with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC.4 Unmet need remains high and options are limited for NSCLC patients with the KRAS G12C mutation that have failed first-line treatment. The outcomes with current therapies are suboptimal with response rates of approximately 9-18% and a median progression-free survival of approximately 4 months for second-line NSCLC.5,6,7

Amgen has taken on one of the toughest challenges of the last 40 years in cancer research8 by developing sotorasib. Sotorasib was the first KRASG12C inhibitor to enter the clinic and is being studied in the broadest clinical program exploring 10 combinations with global sites spanning across 4 continents. In just over two years, the sotorasib clinical program has also established the deepest clinical data set with more than 600 patients studied across 13 tumor types.

“Breakthrough Therapy designation and Real-Time Oncology Review bring Amgen closer to potentially providing a targeted therapy to patients with a KRAS G12C mutation and establishing sotorasib as the foundational therapy in KRAS G12C-driven cancers,” said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “We are pleased to receive these regulatory designations and plan to submit a new drug application by end of year as we rapidly work to get sotorasib to the patients who need it.”

A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of medicines that may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.9 The Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible.10

The designation and RTOR are supported by positive Phase 2 results in patients with advanced NSCLC from the CodeBreaK 100 clinical study, whose cancer had progressed despite prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. In the study, treatment with sotorasib provided durable anticancer activity with a positive benefit-risk profile.11 

About CodeBreaK
The CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen’s investigational drug sotorasib is designed to treat patients with an advanced solid tumor with the KRAS G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers. As the most advanced KRAS G12C clinical development program, CodeBreaK has enrolled more than 600 patients across 13 tumor types since its inception.

CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors. Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The Phase 2 trial in NSCLC enrolled 126 patients, 123 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline. The Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer (CRC) is fully enrolled and topline results are expected in 2021.

A global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC (CodeBreaK 200) is currently recruiting. Amgen also has several Phase 1b combination studies across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment.

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

53369,Roche Highlights its Bispecific Antibody Portfolio Across a Range of Blood Cancers at ASH 2020,Roche presents new data from its bispecific antibody portfolio across a range of blood cancers,"The company presented the new data of its T-cell engaging bispecific Abs, mosunetuzumab, glofitamab and cevostamab at ASH 2020, demonstrating encouraging activity across multiple types of blood cancer
 Roche divulges that its mosunetuzumab & glofitamab showed promising responses across multiple types of NHL, including R/R FL & DLBCL, reinforcing from the P-I/Ib GO29781 study results in R/R FL, that showed 51.6% of patients achieved a CR when treated with mosunetuzumab
 Beyond r/r setting, mosunetuzumab & glofitamab are also being evaluated in 1L DLBCL. Additionally, Roche has presented the data of cevostamab that showed a 53% ORR rate in heavily pre-treated patients with MM","Basel, 08 December 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that new data on its investigational T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, mosunetuzumab, glofitamab and cevostamab, were presented at the all-virtual 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, from 5-8 December 2020, showing encouraging activity across multiple types of blood cancer. These antibodies work by binding to two different targets, on two different cells, simultaneously: one on the surface of cancer cells and one on the surface of immune cells called T-cells. This dual targeting approach activates a patient’s existing T-cells to engage and eliminate target cancer cells, offering an innovative approach for the treatment of blood cancers including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM); diseases where treatment options are currently limited, and resistance to, or relapse following, treatment is common. These bispecifics are just one of the novel ‘off-the-shelf’ technologies Roche is exploring, in its quest to improve patient outcomes.

“The data suggest that our novel bispecific antibodies have potential across multiple types of blood cancers, and supports broad exploration of these new immunotherapy approaches across different patient populations and treatment lines,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Lymphoma and multiple myeloma are challenging cancers to treat, especially when patients present with aggressive subtypes or experience multiple relapses, but ‘off-the-shelf’ therapies like these could provide new options that may potentially enable patients to be treated quickly.”

Promising responses with mosunetuzumab and glofitamab in non-Hodgkin lymphoma
To date in clinical trials, Roche’s two CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, mosunetuzumab and glofitamab, have shown promising responses across multiple types of NHL, including relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This is reinforced by the latest results from the phase I/Ib GO29781 study in R/R FL, which show that 51.6% of patients (n=32/62) achieved a complete response (CR) when treated with mosunetuzumab.[1] High response rates also continue to be seen with glofitamab. For example, new data from the phase I/Ib NP30179 study in R/R NHL show a CR rate of 53.6% in aggressive NHL (n=15/28).[2] Additionally, both bispecific antibodies have proven to have manageable safety profiles. One of the most common adverse events (AEs) observed with bispecific antibodies is cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which involves the over activation of immune cells, and is a known risk associated with immunotherapies that activate the body’s own immune system. [3] Based on studies so far, CRS events with mosunetuzumab and glofitamab are largely low-grade (mainly Grade 1-2), occur in early treatment cycles, and are mostly reversible.[1,2]

Beyond the R/R setting, mosunetuzumab and glofitamab are also being investigated in earlier treatment lines, including first-line DLBCL. Initial data with single-agent mosunetuzumab in the phase I/II GO40554 study, show a CR rate of 45.5% (n=10/22) in elderly or unfit patients who are unable to tolerate full-dose immunochemotherapy. Additionally, when mosunetuzumab was combined with chemotherapy in the phase Ib/II GO40515 study, the CR rate was 79.4% (n=27/34). These are the first bispecific antibody studies in 1L DLBCL to report data, and while early, these results support the potential for mosunetuzumab to provide a new, much-needed treatment option for these patients.[4,5]

Robust development programmes are ongoing for mosunetuzumab and glofitamab, investigating the treatments as monotherapies and in combination with other molecules, as well as more convenient forms of administration such as subcutaneous administration, with several phase III trials planned in the near future.

Encouraging activity with cevostamab in heavily pre-treated patients with multiple myeloma
The third of Roche’s bispecific antibodies in malignant haematology, and latest addition to its pipeline, is cevostamab, a first-of-its kind FcRH5xCD3 bispecific antibody targeting FcRH5 on myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells. FcRH5 is a unique and differentiated target and is expressed on nearly 100% of myeloma cells. Cevostamab is currently being investigated in the ongoing phase I GO39775 dose-escalation and expansion study in heavily pre-treated patients with MM (with a median of six prior lines of therapy); a population for whom new treatment options are urgently needed.

First clinical safety and efficacy data presented at ASH, showed an encouraging overall response rate of 53% (n=18/34) at active doses. Notably, responses were seen in high-risk patients, including those refractory to five different classes of drug (penta-drug refractory) and those with prior exposure to anti-BCMA therapy. Safety of cevostamab was manageable with the most common treatment-related AE being CRS (76%). The majority of CRS events were Grade 1–2 (Grade 1; 34% and Grade 2; 40%) and occurred in cycle 1. One patient experienced Grade 3 CRS (2%) and no Grade 4 or 5 CRS events were observed.[6] Additional biomarker analyses presented at the congress are also helping to further understand the potential of cevostamab in MM and inform its future development, including strategies to mitigate the risk of CRS.[7]

Roche is excited about the ongoing development of its three bispecific antibodies in malignant haematology and eager to understand their full potential in patients with blood cancers.

About Roche’s CD20xCD3 bispecific antibodies
Roche is currently developing two T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, mosunetuzumab and glofitamab, designed to target CD20 on the surface of B-cells and CD3 on the surface of T-cells. This dual targeting activates and re-directs a patient’s existing T-cells to engage and eliminate target B-cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins into the B-cells. Mosunetuzumab and glofitamab differ in their structures, and both are being developed by Roche as part of our ongoing haematology research and development strategy to explore multiple bispecific formats, to identify those that may maximise clinical benefits for patients. Mosunetuzumab has a structure similar to that of a natural human antibody in that it has two ‘Fab’ regions, but is different from naturally-occurring antibodies in that one ‘Fab’ region targets CD20 and the other ‘Fab’ region targets CD3. Glofitamab is based on a novel structural format which we call ‘2:1’, which refers to the structure of the antibody. It is engineered to have two ‘Fab’ regions which bind to CD20, and one ‘Fab’ region which binds to CD3. The clinical development programmes for mosunetuzumab and glofitamab include ongoing investigations of these molecules as monotherapies and in combination with other medicines, for the treatment of people with CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, and other blood cancers.

About cevostamab (FcRH5xCD3 bispecific antibody)
Cevostamab (BFCR4350A) is an FcRH5xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody designed to target FcRH5 on myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells. FcRH5 is a unique and differentiated target, expressed on nearly 100% of myeloma cells.[8] Cevostamab has a structure similar to that of a natural human antibody in that it has two ‘Fab’ regions, but is different from naturally-occurring antibodies in that one ‘Fab’ region targets FcRH5 and the other ‘Fab’ region targets CD3. This dual targeting activates and re-directs a patient’s existing T-cells to engage and eliminate target FcRH5-expressing myeloma cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins into the myeloma cells.

About the GO29781 study
The GO29781 study [NCT02500407] is a phase I/Ib, multicentre, open-label, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab in people with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Outcome measures include best objective response rate by revised International Working Group criteria, maximum tolerated dose and tolerability.

About the GO40554 study
The GO40554 study [NCT03677154] is a phase I/II, multicentre, open-label, randomised study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of mosunetuzumab following first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) immunochemotherapy, or in participants with previously untreated DLBCL who are unable to tolerate full-dose, first-line immunochemotherapy. Primary objectives include complete response rate at time of primary response assessment, as measured by PET-CT, according to Lugano 2014 Response Criteria, and safety. Secondary objectives include assessment of pharmacokinetics, objective response rate, duration of response and progression-free survival.

About the NP30179 study
The NP30179 study [NCT03075696] is a phase I/Ib, multicentre, open-label, dose-escalation study, evaluating the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of glofitamab. In this study, glofitamab is assessed as a single-agent and in combination with Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® (obinutuzumab), following pre-treatment with a one-time, fixed-dose of Gazyva/Gazyvaro, in people with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Outcome measures include overall response rate, complete response rate per Lugano 2014 criteria, maximum tolerated dose and tolerability.

About the GO39775 study
The GO39775 study [NCT03275103] is a phase I, multicentre trial evaluating the safety and activity of cevostamab (BFCR4350A) monotherapy in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma for which no established therapies are available, appropriate or tolerable. Prior exposure to CAR T-cells, T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) and antibody-drug conjugates, including those targeting BCMA, is allowed. Primary objectives are to evaluate safety (including the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities) and to identify a recommended phase II dose. Secondary objectives include assessment of pharmacokinetics, activity, immunogenicity and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

53397,Lilly Reports Results of Tirzepatide in P-lll SURPASS-1 Monotherapy Trial for Type-2 Diabetes,Lilly’s tirzepatide significantly reduced A1C and body weight in people with type 2 diabetes,"The P-lll SURPASS-1 study involves assessing Tirzepatide as monothx. (5/10/15 mg) vs PBO in 478 patients in the ratio of (1:1:1:1) with T2D inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone
 Results: A1C reduction: (-1.75% /-1.71%/-1.69% vs- 0.09%); Weight reduction: 6.3/7.0/7.8kg vs 1.0 kg; percentage of participants achieving A1C <7%: 81.8%/84.5%/ 78.3% vs 23.0%; percentage of participants achieving A1C <5.7%: 30.9% /26.8%/38.4% vs 1.4% respectively
 The highest dose led to A1C reduction of 2.07 % with a reduction in body weight by 9.5 kg (11 %), 51.7 % of patients achieved an A1C less than 5.7 %","INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Tirzepatide led to superior A1C and body weight reductions from baseline in adults with type 2 diabetes after 40 weeks of treatment in topline results from Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) SURPASS-1 monotherapy clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared to placebo. Using the efficacy estimandi, the highest dose of tirzepatide led to an A1C reduction of 2.07 percent and reduced body weight by 9.5 kg (11.0 percent). More than half (51.7 percent) of participants in this arm achieved an A1C less than 5.7 percent – the level seen in people without diabetes.

The overall safety profile of tirzepatide was similar to the well-established GLP-1 receptor agonist class, with gastrointestinal side effects being the most commonly reported adverse events. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were less than 7 percent in each tirzepatide treatment arm.

Tirzepatide is a novel investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single molecule, representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The primary and key secondary endpoints of SURPASS-1, the first phase 3 trial of the comprehensive SURPASS program, included superior A1C and mean body weight reductions compared to placebo. Study participants, 54.2 percent of whom were treatment-naïve, had a relatively short mean duration of diabetes of 4.7 years, a baseline A1C of 7.9 percent and a baseline weight of 85.9 kg.

“Tirzepatide delivered impressive A1C and weight reductions for people with type 2 diabetes in this trial, confirming and building upon the phase 2 data that were released in 2018,” said Julio Rosenstock, M.D., Director of the Dallas Diabetes Research Center and Principal Investigator of SURPASS-1. “The study took a bold approach in assessing A1C targets. Not only did nearly 90 percent of all participants taking tirzepatide meet the standard A1C goal of less than 7 percent, more than half taking the highest dose also achieved an A1C less than 5.7 percent, the level seen in people without diabetes – an unprecedented finding and unique endpoint in trials evaluating glucose-lowering agents.”

Treatment differences for two estimands – efficacy and treatment-regimenii – were evaluated for the three tirzepatide doses (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) compared to placebo. Across both estimands, all three tirzepatide doses reached statistical significance in A1C and body weight reductions from baseline and in the percentage of participants who achieved an A1C of less than 7 percent (the American Diabetes Association’s recommended target for people with diabetes) or less than 5.7 percent.

Weight reduction: -6.3 kg (5 mg), -7.0 kg (10 mg), -7.8 kg (15 mg), -1.0 kg (placebo)
Percentage of participants achieving A1C <7%: 81.8% (5 mg), 84.5% (10 mg), 78.3% (15 mg), 23.0% (placebo)
Percentage of participants achieving A1C <5.7%: 30.9% (5 mg), 26.8% (10 mg), 38.4% (15 mg), 1.4% (placebo)
No events of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia less than 54 mg/dL were observed in the tirzepatide treatment arms.

The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and mild to moderate in severity, usually occurring during the dose escalation period. For study participants treated with tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively), nausea (11.6 percent, 13.2 percent, 18.2 percent), diarrhea (11.6 percent, 14.0 percent, 11.6 percent), vomiting (3.3 percent, 2.5 percent, 5.8 percent) and constipation (5.8 percent, 5.0 percent, 6.6 percent) were more frequently experienced compared to placebo (6.1 percent [nausea], 7.8 percent [diarrhea], 1.7 percent [vomiting], 0.9 percent [constipation]). The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 9.1 percent (5 mg), 9.9 percent (10 mg), 21.5 percent (15 mg) and 14.8 percent (placebo). The majority of the discontinuations in the 15 mg and placebo arms were due to reasons other than adverse events (such as concerns due to the coronavirus pandemic and family or work reasons).

“As a leader in diabetes care, we have a nearly 100-year heritage of innovating to advance care for people living with diabetes. Tirzepatide is the first dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist to complete a phase 3 trial,” said Mike Mason, president, Lilly Diabetes. “We are impressed by these initial results showing how tirzepatide performed in people with a relatively short duration of diabetes, and we look forward to seeing more results in people who are later in the course of diabetes in future studies from our robust SURPASS clinical trial program.”

The complete SURPASS-1 study data have not yet been evaluated but will be presented at the American Diabetes Association’s® 81st Scientific Sessions® and published in a peer-reviewed publication in 2021.

About tirzepatide
Tirzepatide is a once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single novel molecule. GIP is a hormone that may complement the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists. In preclinical models, GIP has been shown to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure therefore resulting in weight reductions, and when combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, may result in greater effects on glucose and body weight. Tirzepatide is in phase 3 development for blood glucose management in adults with type 2 diabetes and for chronic weight management. It is also being studied as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

About SURPASS-1 and the SURPASS clinical trial program
SURPASS-1 (NCT03954834) is a 40-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg as monotherapy to placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone. The trial randomized 478 study participants across the U.S., Mexico, India and Japan in 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg or placebo. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg) is superior in A1C reduction from baseline after 40 weeks in people with type 2 diabetes naïve to injectable therapy who haven’t used any oral antidiabetic medicines within three months compared to placebo. Study participants had a mean A1C between 7 percent and 9.5 percent and a BMI greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2. All participants in the tirzepatide treatment arms started the study at a dose of tirzepatide 2.5 mg once-weekly and then increased the dose in a step-wise approach at four-week intervals to their final randomized maintenance dose of 5 mg (via a 2.5 mg step), 10 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 7.5 mg) or 15 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg and 12.5 mg).

The SURPASS phase 3 global clinical development program for tirzepatide has enrolled more than 10,000 people with type 2 diabetes across eight clinical trials, five of which are global registration studies. The program began in late 2018 with results anticipated in late 2020 and 2021.

About Diabetes
Approximately 34 million Americans1 (just over 1 in 10) and an estimated 463 million adults worldwide2 have diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type internationally, accounting for an estimated 90 to 95 percent of all diabetes cases in the United States alone1. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body does not properly produce or use the hormone insulin.

53402,Roche Collaborate with Moderna to include SARS-CoV-2 Ab Test in COVID-19 Vaccine Trials,Roche partners with Moderna to include SARS-CoV-2 antibody test in ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials,"Roche allied with Moderna to utilize the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S Ab test in mRNA-1273 study. The collaboration will facilitate the quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 Abs and help to establish a correlation b/w vaccine-induced protection and levels of anti-RBD Abs
 The alliance follows US FDA’s EUA for the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S Ab test. Moderna’s vaccine is in late-stage trials with 30,000+ participants, showed the efficacy of 94% in preventing COVID-19, and is designed to trigger an Ab response to proteins found on the coronavirus spike’s receptor-binding domain
 Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the qualitative, in vitro detection of Abs (including IgG) to SARS-CoV-2","Basel, 9 December 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced a partnership with Moderna Inc. to utilise the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody test in Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine research trials. This will facilitate the quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and help to establish a correlation between vaccine-induced protection and levels of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies. Significantly, Moderna’s vaccine triggers antibody response specifically to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This follows the recent announcement that Roche has received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody test.

“Roche values the collaboration with Moderna, which has already included the successful use of our qualitative Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test, targeting the nucleocapsid protein, in an earlier part of the studies”, said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “We are pleased to see that our quantitative Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 S test, which targets the spike protein, is now also being used as part of the Moderna vaccine trials, which could ultimately help to end this pandemic.”

Measuring the quantitative levels of anti-RBD SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using Roche’s test will help Moderna to gain valuable insights into the correlation between protection from vaccination and antibody levels. This could play a role in assessing if, or when, an individual needs revaccination, or in helping to answer other clinically relevant questions.

To enhance our understanding of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 there would be a benefit in knowing the starting levels of antibodies a person has, prior to vaccination, in order to evaluate any change in antibody levels that the vaccine induces. This is particularly relevant in the case of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, since these antibodies have been shown to have potent antiviral activity and correlate to potential immunity.1 Measuring antibody levels can also play a role in establishing vaccine efficacy in the prevention of infection and/or the development of severe COVID-19.2

This partnership with Moderna, started by using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test for qualitative determination of anti-N SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This has been part of Moderna’s vaccine trials for baselining and assessing natural infection in trial participants.

About potential SARS-COV-2 vaccines
Candidate vaccines, such as Moderna’s mRNA-1237, aim to induce an antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Any potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 would work (amongst other mechanisms) by triggering the immune response to develop neutralising antibodies in the person receiving the vaccine. In doing so, the vaccine trains the body’s immune system to recognise and fight an exposure to SARS-CoV-2, in a controlled way, without being exposed to the actual virus.2

About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test
Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S is an immunoassay for the quantitative, in vitro determination of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma. Through a blood sample, the test can measure the quantity of antibodies to the spike protein of the coronavirus. Specifically, the test targets antibodies which are directed against the particular region of the viral spike protein responsible for binding to the host cell receptor, which is required for the virus to enter the host cell.

The presence and level of such antibodies could signal whether a person has been already infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus.

This plays an important part in characterising a vaccine-induced immune response.2 The majority of current candidate vaccines aim to induce an antibody response against the spike protein.

About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test
Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the qualitative, in vitro detection of antibodies (including IgG) to SARS-CoV-2. The test can detect antibodies to the coronavirus, which could signal whether a person has been already infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. This test can also help in the determination of seroprevalence (i.e. the frequency of individuals with antibody to the virus), in a given population, as well as a complement test to Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Hospitals and reference laboratories can run both the tests on Roche’s cobas e analysers which are widely available around the world. These fully-automated systems can provide SARS-CoV-2 test results in approximately 18 minutes, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyser.3

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
As a leading healthcare company we are doing all we can to support countries in minimising the impact of COVID-19. We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help to detect and diagnose the infection in patients, as well as providing digital support to healthcare systems, and we continue to identify, develop and support potential therapies which can play a role in treating the disease.

We understand the impact of COVID-19 goes beyond those who contract it, which is why we are working with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need during these challenging times. As we learn from the pandemic, we are partnering with governments and others to make healthcare stronger and more sustainable in the future.

Our diagnostics solutions:
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. Our portfolio includes:

a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, (FDA Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) and available in countries accepting the CE Mark)
a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-based antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood targeting the nucleocapsid (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
an IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19 (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic
a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test to help determine at the point of care whether a person has been exposed to the virus (CE Mark)
a rapid antigen test to support in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care within 15 minutes (CE Mark)
a high-volume molecular test to simultaneously detect and differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B, as the symptoms are similar for both (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
a second SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, aimed at measuring the spike protein to support vaccination development and complement our existing portfolio
a point-of-care molecular PCR test that simultaneously detects and differentiates between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B infections to support urgent triage and diagnosis (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
Our research into therapies:
Roche is committed to improving the treatment of COVID-19. We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are exploring the potential of our investigational molecules.

In August we signed a collaboration agreement with Regeneron on developing and manufacturing and significantly increasing global supply of an investigational antibody combination for COVID-19 if it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted. We are also partnering with Atea to jointly develop AT-527, an orally administered direct-acting antiviral (DAA) currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. If approved, Atea will distribute AT-527 in the United States and Roche will be responsible for global manufacturing and distribution outside the United States.

At the beginning of the pandemic, on 19 March on 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA – a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. On 29 July we announced that COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia or the key secondary endpoint of reduced mortality.

Separately, we have studied Actemra©/RoActemra© in the EMPACTA study in COVID-19 associated hospitalised pneumonia in patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials. On 18 September we announced that the phase III EMPACTA study showed Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care reduced the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. However, there was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra/RoActemra or placebo.

Actemra©/RoActemra© is also being studied in combination with the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the REMDACTA trial in partnership with Gilead, announced 28 May. Actemra©/RoActemra© is not approved by any health authority for use in COVID-19 pneumonia. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

53408,Novartis Reports Results of Kisqali in P-III MONALEESA-7 Trial to Treat HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer,Novartis Kisqali® demonstrates nearly five years median overall survival in metastatic breast cancer,"The P-III MONALEESA-7 trial involves assessing Kisqali + endocrine therapy (goserelin + either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen) as initial treatment vs endocrine therapy alone in patients with HR+/HER2- m-BC
 Result: @53.5 mos. follow-up, m-OS (58.7 vs 48.0 mos.); similar m-OS (58.7 vs 47.7 mos.) observed in IIT population; @ 42 mos. follow-up, estimated survival rate (70.2% vs 46%)
 The US FDA and EC has approved Kisqali in Mar’2017 and Aug’2017 as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- LA/m-BC in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial","EAST HANOVER, N.J., Dec. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Novartis today announced updated median overall survival (OS) results for Kisqali® (ribociclib) in combination with endocrine therapy, marking the longest survival data ever reported in premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. The Phase III MONALEESA-7 trial evaluated Kisqali plus endocrine therapy (goserelin plus either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen) as initial treatment compared to endocrine therapy alone in pre- and perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. These updated median OS data will be presented today at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Virtual Symposium.

After a median of 53.5 months follow-up, median OS for patients taking Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy was 58.7 months vs. 48.0 months for endocrine therapy alone (HR=0.76 [95% CI: 0.61-0.96])1. Additionally, a similar median OS benefit of 58.7 months was observed with Kisqali plus an aromatase inhibitor subgroup vs. 47.7 months in the placebo plus aromatase inhibitor subgroup (HR=0.80 [95% CI, 0.62-1.04]), and the survival benefit shown in subgroup analyses was consistent with the intent-to-treat (ITT) population1. This exploratory ad hoc analysis follows the previously reported MONALEESA-7 OS analysis presented at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which demonstrated statistically significant OS results for Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy. After a median of 42 months follow-up, the estimated survival rate was 70.2% [95% CI: 63.5 to 76.0] for women who received Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy compared to 46.0% [95% CI, 32.0 to 58.9] for women who received endocrine therapy alone (HR=0.71 [95% CI: 0.54 to 0.95]) p=0.00973)4.

“These longer-term data showing ribociclib can help women with metastatic breast cancer live longer are remarkable and emphasize the progress we’ve made in treating this disease, which until now, had an estimated median survival of just three years,” said Debu Tripathy, M.D., chair of Breast Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center. “I’m hopeful the proven overall survival benefit with ribociclib will shift the standard for those with metastatic breast cancer, and that patients are empowered to ask their doctors about which treatments give them the best chance of living longer with the best quality of life.”

The need for chemotherapy was delayed by more than four years (50.9 months) in patients taking Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy (HR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.56-0.87)1. No new adverse events were observed. Kisqali is not indicated for use with tamoxifen.

“We’re proud to be able to provide the CDK4/6 inhibitor with the longest ever reported median overall survival benefit of nearly five years in younger women,” said Susanne Schaffert, Ph.D., President, Novartis Oncology. “It is our vision to develop therapies that give patients the longest life possible, and these best-in-class data help us realize that vision by proving Kisqali extends the lives of younger premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, who typically have more aggressive disease and unique needs.”

Metastatic breast cancer in premenopausal women is biologically distinct, more aggressive and the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59 years old2,3.

About Kisqali® (ribociclib)
Kisqali was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 and by the European Commission (EC) in August 2017, as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial. Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor was approved for the treatment of pre-, peri- or postmenopausal women as initial endocrine based therapy, and also indicated for use in combination with fulvestrant as both first- or second-line therapy in postmenopausal women by the FDA in July 2018 and by the EC in December 2018. Regulatory filings are underway with other health authorities worldwide.

Kisqali was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals.

Approved Uses
KISQALI® (ribociclib) is a prescription medicine used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of pre/perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as initial endocrine-based therapy; or fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as initial endocrine-based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy. It is not known if Kisqali is safe and effective in children or adolescents.

Important Safety Information
KISQALI may cause severe or life-threatening inflammation of the lungs during treatment that may lead to death. Patients should contact their doctor right away if they have trouble breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain, cough with or without mucus. Severe skin reactions skin reactions have been reported with Kisqali. Patients should get medical help right away if they have a severe rash or rash that keeps getting worse.

Kisqali can cause a heart problem known as QT prolongation. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and may lead to death. Kisqali is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen due to an increased risk of QT prolongation. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have a change in their heartbeat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if they feel dizzy or faint. Kisqali can cause serious liver problems. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they get any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark or brown (tea-colored) urine, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, pain on the upper right side of the stomach area (abdomen), and bleeding or bruising more easily than normal.

Low white blood cell counts are very common when taking Kisqali and may result in infections that may be severe. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have signs and symptoms of low white blood cell counts or infections such as fever and chills. Before taking Kisqali, patients should tell their health care provider if they are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant as Kisqali can harm an unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant and who take Kisqali should use highly effective birth control during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Do not breastfeed during treatment with Kisqali and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Patients should tell their health care provider about all of the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements since they may interact with Kisqali. Patients should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking Kisqali.

The most common side effects (incidence >=20%) include infections, white blood cell count decreases, headache, cough, nausea, tiredness, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, hair loss and rash. The most common Grade 3/4 side effects (incidence >5%) were infections, low neutrophils, low leukocytes, low red blood cells, abnormal liver function tests, low lymphocytes, low phosphate levels and vomiting. Abnormalities were observed in hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory tests.

53416,Google Launches Health Research App Focusing on Respiratory Illnesses,Advancing health research with Google Health Studies,"Google has launched the Google Health Studies app for Android phones with the initial focus on respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. The app is now available in the play store
 Google allied with researchers from Harvard Medical School and Boston Children Hospital for the first study, which will be open to adults in the US and will focus on identifying how these types of illnesses evolve in communities and differ across risk factors such as age, and activities
 The app provides a platform for researchers to reach a large & diverse population to better understand human health while providing the public with greater opportunities to contribute to medical research","COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of research in providing information about disease and treatments. However, it’s challenging for researchers to recruit enough volunteers so that studies are representative of the general population. To make it easier for leading research institutions to connect with potential study participants, we’re introducing the Google Health Studies app with the first study focused on respiratory illness.

With the new app, anyone with an Android phone can take part in health studies by answering survey questions and contributing relevant data. The app provides a platform for researchers to reach a large and diverse population so they can better understand human health, while providing the public with greater opportunities to contribute to medical research.

Keeping participant data private, safe and secure
In building the app we focused on three principles: keeping information safe, treating it responsibly, and putting participants in control. When participants use the Google Health Studies app, their data is protected with Google’s advanced security. All information is encrypted and research data is stored securely.

We also give participants transparency and control over their personal information. For each study, participants can clearly see what data is being contributed, and when and why it’s shared. To protect participants’ personal information we adhere to strict privacy policies. Study data will only be used for the purposes that are explicitly consented to in the research study and will not be sold, shared with advertisers, or be used to show participants ads. The Google Health Studies app also makes it easy for participants to understand their contributions to each study, as well as access research findings when they become available.

Studying respiratory illnesses
We’ve partnered with researchers from Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital for the first study, which will help scientists and public health communities better understand respiratory illnesses, including influenza and COVID-19.

This Respiratory Health Study will be open to adults in the U.S., and will focus on identifying how these types of illnesses evolve in communities and differ across risk factors such as age, and activities such as travel. Study participants will use the Google Health Studies app to regularly self-report how they feel, what symptoms they may be experiencing, any preventative measures they’ve taken, and additional information such as COVID-19 or influenza test results. By taking part in this study, volunteers can represent their community in medical research, and contribute to global efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

“With COVID-19 emerging alongside seasonal respiratory pathogens, research is now needed more than ever to develop more effective treatments and mitigation strategies,” says Dr. John Brownstein, professor at Harvard Medical School and Chief Innovation Officer of Boston Children’s Hospital. “Google Health Studies provides people with a secure and easy way to take part in medical research, while letting researchers discover novel epidemiological insights into respiratory diseases.”

In collaboration with Google Research, this first study utilizes federated learning and analytics—a privacy technology that keeps a person’s data stored on the device, while allowing researchers to discover aggregate insights based on encrypted, combined updates from many devices. This means researchers in this study can examine trends to understand the link between mobility (such as the number of daily trips a person makes outside the home) and the spread of COVID-19, This same approach powers typing predictions on Gboard, without Google seeing what individuals type.

The Google Health Studies app is now available in the Google Play Store, and we’re inviting people to download the app to join this initial study. We look forward to partnering with health researchers and to making it possible for more people to participate in these important studies.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Website-Size-73.jpg,DigiHealth,Google,Google Health Studies app,COVID-19|DigiHealth|Flu|App|Launches|Virtual Medical Research,publish,12/10/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/advancing-health-research-with-google-health-studies/,https://pharmashots.com/53416/google-launches-health-research-app-focusing-on-respiratory-illnesses/

 NBE-Therapeutics’ iADC platform will add exceptional tumor-targeting capabilities to Boehringer Ingelheim’s oncology portfolio. The deal comes one month after Merck’s $2.8B acquisition of VelosBio for its anti-ROR1 ADC","Ingelheim, Germany and Basel, Switzerland – 10 December 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim today announced the signing of a binding agreement for acquiring all shares of NBE-Therapeutics, a private, clinical-stage Swiss biotechnology company focused on antibody-drug conjugates and advancing targeted cancer therapies derived from its immune stimulatory iADC™ platform. NBE-Therapeutics’ lead compound NBE-002 is currently in phase I clinical studies for triple negative breast cancer and other solid tumors. Importantly, Boehringer Ingelheim gains access to an innovative and unique platform that it will use to build a leading ADC portfolio and develop potential combinations with other assets from its cancer immunology portfolio.

“NBE-Therapeutics’ iADC platform adds exceptional tumor targeting capabilities to our oncology portfolio. Together with our immune cell-targeting assets, this could enable new powerful combinations that will allow for efficacious and durable treatments for patients,” said Michel Pairet, member of Boehringer Ingelheim’s Board of Managing Directors with responsibility for the company’s Innovation Unit. “This acquisition is a further example of Boehringer Ingelheim’s long-term strategy to enhance our position as an innovator of novel cancer therapies for patients in need. We welcome NBE-Therapeutics’ richly talented team to Boehringer Ingelheim and we look forward to collaborating with them on this important work.”

The total transaction value is 1.18 billion euros and also includes contingent clinical and regulatory milestones.

“I am extremely proud of the NBE-Therapeutics’ team and delighted that our world class ADC expertise is being recognized by Boehringer Ingelheim. This transaction is a validation of our platform and its potential for the next generation cancer therapies,” said Bertrand Damour, Chief Executive Officer of NBE-Therapeutics. “We look forward to progressing NBE-002, our lead program and best-in-class anti ROR1 ADC, and to continuing the fight against cancer alongside Boehringer Ingelheim with its strong clinical development capabilities.”

Boehringer Ingelheim’s cancer cell directed research is focused on the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of difficult-to-treat solid tumors. Inducing tumor cell death is a key component, and ADC based approaches have emerged as a powerful targeted therapy with potential for induction of immunogenic cell death at reduced systemic exposure and toxicity.

The NBE-Therapeutics’ acquisition will significantly strengthen Boehringer Ingelheim’s strategic focus on targeted cancer cell-directed therapies and complements existing capabilities in antigen discovery as well as antibody and T-cell engager technologies. By combining its world-class, in-house research and development with that of highly innovative biotechnology companies, Boehringer Ingelheim is developing innovative therapies and accelerating the delivery of the next generation of cancer treatments. This builds on recent strategic acquisitions and collaborations, including the acquisition of ViraTherapeutics and AMAL Therapeutics, which are also contributing assets.

NBE-Therapeutics is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, where it was founded with financial backing from a syndicate of both corporate and institutional investors, including the Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund, and PPF Group, as their largest shareholders, and Denmark’s Novo Holdings. NBE-Therapeutics’ technology platform and derived assets are protected by a broad portfolio of patents and licenses.

The consummation of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected during the course of Q1 2021.

About the ADC Platform
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC’s) are a class of drugs that consist of an antibody that specifically binds to a target on tumor cells. The antibody is also linked to a cytotoxic drug to kill these cells. If the drug was given systemically, it would cause an unacceptable level of toxicity. However, due to the ability to now localize the drug to the tumor microenvironment using an antibody, the safety profile of the drug becomes acceptable.

NBE-Therapeutics’ proprietary technology platform creates highly potent immune stimulatory antibody-drug conjugates with an anthracycline payload, directly targeting tumor cells and inducing a long-lasting immunological anti-tumor effect. Its technology also incorporates a proprietary enzymatic conjugation step allowing for the site-specific conjugation of small molecule drugs to monoclonal antibodies overcoming liabilities related to limited serum stability and heterogeneous linkage.

About NBE-002
NBE-Therapeutics’ lead candidate, NBE-002, is an anti-ROR1 ADC. ROR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in various hematologic and solid malignancies, including triple negative breast cancers and lung adenocarcinoma. The compound is currently in phase I clinical studies.

About NBE-Therapeutics 
NBE-Therapeutics is a privately-owned Swiss biotech company based in Basel and founded in 2012 with the vision of developing next-generation immune-stimulatory antibody drug conjugate (iADC™) products. NBE-Therapeutics advances its products to clinical proof of concept with the goal of improving treatment options for cancer patients.

The company leverages proprietary platforms covering all aspects of ADC development: its Transpo-mAb Display™ technology for antibody discovery, its SMAC-Technology™ for site-specific payload conjugation of toxins to antibodies and a novel highly effective and immune-stimulatory anthracycline-based toxin platform. The company is financially backed by the Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund, the PPF Group and Novo Holdings as institutional investors, and by additional Swiss, German and Dutch private investors.

It is expected that this transaction will accelerate the global launch of Hepcludex. Hepcludex is a first-in-class treatment for HDV that blocks viral entry into liver cells through binding to NTCP. It is the first and currently the only medicine conditionally approved for HDV by the EMA, and MYR anticipates submission for accelerated approval in the United States in the second half of 2021. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the medicine both Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designations for chronic HDV infection.

HDV is the most severe form of viral hepatitis and can have mortality rates as high as 50% within 5 years in cirrhotic patients. HDV occurs only as a co-infection in individuals who have hepatitis B virus (HBV). At least 12 million people worldwide are likely currently co-infected with HDV and HBV. HDV co-infection leads to more serious liver disease than HBV alone and is associated with a faster progression to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and an increased risk of liver cancer and death. In the United States and Europe, there are collectively more than 230,000 people living with HDV, which remains underdiagnosed globally.

“HDV is a devastating disease with high unmet medical need. With Hepcludex we have the opportunity to address that need with a first-in-class therapy,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. “We look forward to working with the team at MYR to realize the full potential of Hepcludex for patients with HDV worldwide. This will build on the work that Gilead has been doing for almost two decades to innovate and improve therapies for viral hepatitis.”

“We are proud of our achievement in bringing Hepcludex from preclinical stage to patients in need within such a short timeframe,” said Dmitry Popov, Chief Executive Officer, MYR GmbH. “We are excited to join Gilead, whose experience in the hepatitis field and global infrastructure will realize the full potential of Hepcludex and provide access to as many patients as possible around the world with this debilitating disease.”

Hepcludex (bulevirtide) is an entry inhibitor that binds to NTCP, an essential HBV and HDV receptor on hepatocytes, blocking the ability of HDV to enter hepatocytes. Bulevirtide has been tested in more than 500 patients in completed and ongoing clinical studies. The benefit of bulevirtide has been demonstrated by an effective reduction of HDV RNA levels and improvement of liver inflammation. In the MYR202 study, which was a controlled, open-label Phase 2 study, 54 of 90 patients treated with bulevirtide plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) had at least a 2 log10 HDV RNA decline or undetectable HDV RNA at week 24 versus 1 of 28 patients given TDF alone. Almost half of patients treated with bulevirtide and TDF also showed a normalization in the blood levels of the liver enzyme ALT, indicating an improvement of liver disease, as compared to 7% of patients who received TDF alone.

In the Phase 2 MYR203 study evaluating a 48-week treatment course of bulevirtide, a further 15 patients were treated with Hepcludex 2mg daily monotherapy for 48 weeks. In this limited dataset, the safety and efficacy profiles were similar to patients treated for 24 weeks in combination with TDF in the MYR202 study. Interim 24-week data from the ongoing Phase 3 study MYR301 of bulevirtide is anticipated in the first half of 2021 and is expected to serve as the basis for filing in the United States.

Terms of the Agreement

Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, Gilead will acquire MYR for approximately €1.15 billion in cash, payable upon closing of the transaction plus a potential future milestone payment of up to €300 million upon U.S. FDA approval (both payments subject to customary adjustments). After the closing, in addition to enhancing Gilead’s revenue growth, the acquisition of MYR is expected to be neutral to non-GAAP EPS in the first two years after close and moderately accretive thereafter. Closing of the transaction is subject to expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and receipt of merger control approvals in certain European jurisdictions.

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is acting as financial advisor to Gilead. UBS Europe SE is acting as financial advisor to MYR. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Mayer Brown LLP, and Flick Gocke Schaumburg are serving as legal counsel to Gilead and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer Rechtsanwälte Steuerberater PartG mbB is serving as legal counsel to MYR.

About Hepcludex (bulevirtide)

Hepcludexis the first drug conditionally approved for the treatment of HDV in adults with compensated liver disease in Europe. Hepcludex blocks the NTCP receptor on the surface of hepatocytes and prevents the entry of HBV/HDV into hepatocytes and viral spread within the liver. Hepcludex is administered subcutaneously as monotherapy or in patients being treated with a nucleoside/nucleotide analogue. Hepcludexhas received Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of HDV infection from EMA and from the FDA. Hepcludex has been granted PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme eligibility by EMA for the treatment of HDV infection and Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. Bulevirtide is an investigational agent in the U.S. and outside of the European Economic Area; in these regions the safety and efficacy have not been established.

The most commonly reported serious adverse reaction was an exacerbation of hepatitis after treatment discontinuation, and most commonly reported adverse reactions were an increase in bile salts and injection site reactions. The safety and efficacy of Hepcludex in patients with decompensated cirrhosis have not been established and therefore its use is not recommended.

53484,Biogen Reports NDA Submission of Aducanumab (BIIB037) to the MHLW for Alzheimer's Disease,Biogen Files New Drug Application for Aducanumab in Japan,"The submission is based on P-lll EMERGE and ENGAGE study assessing aducanumab vs PBO in patients with AD. The studies evaluate the efficacy of monthly doses of aducanumab in reducing cognitive and functional impairment
 The secondary objectives of the study were to assess the effect of monthly doses of aducanumab on the clinical decline as measured by MMSE, ADAS-Cog 13 & ADCS-ADL-MCI. MHLW will review the application through the standard review process
 Aducanumab is an investigational mAb that is under the US FDA’s PR with an anticipated PDUFA date as Mar 7, 2021 and is also under review with the EMA","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and TOKYO, Dec. 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Today, Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Eisai, Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) announced that Biogen has submitted a Japanese New Drug Application (J-NDA) to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for aducanumab, an investigational therapy for Alzheimer’s disease. Aducanumab, an amyloid beta-targeting antibody, has been shown in clinical trials to remove amyloid beta in the brain and significantly slow clinical decline in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia.

“Japan is the third market where we have applied for regulatory approval for aducanumab, and the filing represents continued progress on our commitment to bring this therapy to patients around the world,” said Michel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen. “Japan has met the challenges of a rapidly aging population by demonstrating global leadership in setting policies that aim to increase support for Alzheimer’s disease patients and caregivers. We look forward to the regulatory review of aducanumab with the hope that, if approved, it could help further manage the impact of this devastating disease.”

“As Japan has the oldest population in the world, it is anticipated that the social burden of Alzheimer’s disease will continue to grow,” said Dr. Haruo Naito, Chief Executive Officer at Eisai Co., Ltd. “For more than 30 years, Eisai has been dedicated to dementia research and development, and working with people living with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers to fight this disease. The filing of the application is an important step in serving patients and their families as aducanumab may help reduce clinical decline and potentially maintain the ability to live an independent life for as long as possible. Aducanumab also has the potential to help address the public health challenges our aging population faces in Japan.”

The Japanese regulatory authority will review the application through the standard review process. In addition to the filing in Japan, aducanumab is under Priority Review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of March 7, 2021 and is also under review with the European Medicines Agency.

About Aducanumab
Aducanumab (BIIB037) is an investigational human monoclonal antibody studied for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Based on clinical data from patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease, aducanumab has the potential to impact underlying disease pathophysiology, slow cognitive and functional decline and provide benefits on patients’ ability to perform activities of daily living, including conducting personal finances, performing household chores, such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry, and independently traveling out of the home. If approved, aducanumab would be the first treatment to meaningfully change the course of the disease for individuals living with Alzheimer’s.

Biogen licensed aducanumab from Neurimmune under a collaborative development and license agreement. Since October 2017 Biogen and Eisai Co., Ltd. have collaborated on the development and commercialization of aducanumab globally.

EMERGE and ENGAGE were Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab. The primary objective of the studies was to evaluate the efficacy of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared with placebo in reducing cognitive and functional impairment as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared to placebo on clinical decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 Items (ADAS-Cog 13) and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory Mild Cognitive Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-MCI).

About Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that impairs thinking, memory and independence, leading to premature death. The disease currently cannot be stopped, delayed or prevented and is a growing global health crisis, affecting those living with the disease and their families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tens of millions of people worldwide live with Alzheimer’s disease, and the number will grow in the years ahead, outpacing the healthcare resources needed to manage it and costing billions of dollars.

According to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry, it is estimated approximately 4.6 million people live with dementia and about 4 million people live with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in Japan (2012). Alzheimer’s disease is suspected to represent around 60-70% of dementia cases.

Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by changes in the brain, including the abnormal accumulation of toxic amyloid beta plaque, which begins approximately 20 years before patients exhibit symptoms of the disease. MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease is one of the earliest stages of the disease when symptoms start to be more visible and can be detected and diagnosed. Current research efforts are focused on catching and treating patients as early as possible for the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

53490,Roche Presents Results of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in P-III IMvigor010 Study for MIUC at ESMO 2020,Roche presents exploratory data from the Phase III IMvigor010 study in early bladder cancer at the ESMO Immuno-Oncology Virtual Congress 2020,"Roche reports an exploratory analysis of P-III IMvigor010 study assessing efficacy and safety of adjuvant treatment with Tecentriq vs observation in 809 people with MIUC, who are at high risk of recurrence following resection
 Results: in people with ctDNA, DFS Median (5.9 vs 4.4 mos.); median OS (25.8 vs 15.8 mos.). As presented in ASCO, the study did not meet its 1EPs of DFS (19.4 vs 16.6 mos.) in IIT population
 In general, people with MIUC who had detectable ctDNA were more likely to benefit from treatment with adjuvant Tecentriq monothx. compared with those without ctDNA","Basel, 10 December 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today presented an exploratory analysis from the Phase III IMvigor010 study evaluating Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), compared with observation, as an adjuvant (after surgery) monotherapy treatment for people with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer (MIUC) at the European Society for Medical Oncology Immuno-Oncology (ESMO IO) Virtual Congress, 9–12 December 2020.

Data from IMvigor010 show that in people with circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), a benefit in disease-free survival (DFS) was seen in those receiving Tecentriq when compared with observation (median 5.9 months versus median 4.4 months, hazard ratio [HR]=0.58; 95% CI: 0.43–0.79). Overall survival (OS) at an interim analysis also favoured treatment with Tecentriq in the ctDNA-positive population, with a median of 25.8 months with Tecentriq, compared with 15.8 months for observation (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.41–0.86). Although these pre-specified analyses are exploratory and could not be formally tested per the statistical plan in the IMvigor010 study, the data further our understanding of the disease and will inform a new Phase III study in people with ctDNA-positive muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

“Bladder cancer is a complex and often difficult disease to treat, but as we continue to understand its biology, we are gaining greater clarity around new therapeutic avenues,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “By using ctDNA and other biomarkers, we hope to gain insights that enable a more personalised approach to treatment. We are applying these findings to our clinical development programme.”

As presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 (ASCO20) Virtual Congress, IMvigor010 did not meet its primary endpoint of DFS compared with observation in people with high-risk MIUC in the intention-to-treat population (19.4 months with Tecentriq versus 16.6 months with observation [HR=0.89; 95% CI: 0.74–1.08; p=0.2446]). In an interim analysis of OS, the median was not reached in either treatment arm (HR=0.85). Safety data for Tecentriq were consistent with the known monotherapy safety profile, and no new safety concerns were identified.

The goal of current treatment in people with MIUC is to provide early intervention to reduce the risk of the disease recurring or spreading to other parts of the body. As tumours grow, dying cells are replaced by new ones, releasing tumour DNA into the bloodstream. This DNA, known as ctDNA, can be utilised in different ways, including identifying people with minimal residual disease who may benefit the most from adjuvant therapy as well as those for whom adjuvant therapy may not provide benefit. In MIUC, ctDNA is a strong prognostic marker of disease recurrence.1 More treatment options following surgery are needed because approximately half of people with MIUC will develop a recurrence of their disease within 2 years of surgery,2 and with no predictive or prognostic biomarkers used in current clinical practice for MIUC,1,3 there is a need for more personalised treatments for this disease.1

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

These data were presented at the ESMO IO Virtual Congress in the Proffered paper oral session on 10 December 2020, 13:50-14:02 CET.

About the IMvigor010 study
IMvigor010 is a global Phase III, open-label, randomised, controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant treatment with Tecentriq compared with observation in 809 people with MIUC, who are at high risk of recurrence following resection. The primary endpoint is DFS as assessed by investigator, which is defined as the time from randomisation to invasive urothelial cancer recurrence or death.

About bladder cancer and muscle-invasive urothelial cancer
In 2018, there were over half a million new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed globally, with approximately 200,000 deaths from the disease.4 Urothelial cancer is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for about 90–95% of all cases.5 MIUC is a type of urothelial cancer that has spread into the muscle of the bladder, ureter or renal pelvis.6 Approximately 25% of new cases of bladder cancer are diagnosed with muscle-invasive disease,7 which is associated with a poorer prognosis than non-MIUC.6

Roche will run a new Phase III study in people with ctDNA-positive muscle-invasive bladder cancer. More information is available here.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and for hepatocellular carcinoma. In the US, Tecentriq is also approved in combination with Cotellic® (cobimetinib) and Zelboraf® (vemurafenib) for the treatment of people with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

About Roche in cancer immunotherapy

53496,Roche Launches Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test to Support High-Volume COVID-19 Testing,Roche launches laboratory SARS-CoV-2 antigen test to support high-volume testing of suspected COVID-19 patients,"Roche has launched Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Ag test as an aid in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections, in the markets accepting the CE Mark. Additionally, Roche has also filed a EUA to the US FDA
 The test showed 94.5% sensitivity across 200 PCR confirmed symptomatic individuals & 99.9% specificity across 2747 PCR negative symptomatic & screening individuals in clinical studies. The company plans to ramp up production to have a double-digit million number of tests/ month, in early 2021
 The test is an immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 present in the respiratory tract including nasopharynx & oropharynx. The test is the latest addition to Roche’s COVID-19 portfolio","Basel, 11 December 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that it has launched a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 antigen test as an aid in the diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, in markets accepting the CE Mark. Roche has also filed for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The Elecsys® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is a highly accurate laboratory immunoassay for the in vitro qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid antigen of SARS‑CoV‑2. In clinical studies, the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test showed a 94.5% sensitivity across 200 PCR confirmed symptomatic individuals* and a 99.9% specificity across 2747 PCR negative symptomatic and screening individuals. It is planned to ramp up production to have a double-digit million number of tests per month, in early 2021, depending on the demand of healthcare systems, globally. The test is performed by healthcare professionals and uses nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples from patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, or people with either known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2. A widely available, laboratory-based automated antigen assay allows for cost and error reduction due to removal of manual handling as well as fast turn-around times and high test throughput.

“Healthcare systems remain under significant pressure to deliver robust testing options, with a sufficient number of tests available”, said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “The launch of our high-throughput antigen test will provide additional testing capacity to reliably support healthcare systems in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection, as a supplement to PCR testing.”

About the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test
Roche’s Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is an immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 present in the respiratory tract including nasopharynx and oropharynx. The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is performed by healthcare professionals and could be used as an alternative or in conjunction with PCR testing. This is highly beneficial where reliable laboratory PCR testing is limited or not available. A positive result with the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test, In symptomatic individuals, a positive result with the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test, indicates an active SARS-CoV-2 infection with a likelihood of 94.5%. A negative result may require to be confirmed with a PCR test or repeated (antigen test) after one to two days, if other clinical indications point to a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen immunoassay runs on all cobas e immunochemistry analysers which are widely available around the world and allow for these test to be run alongside other COVID-19 infectious diseases diagnostic markers available from Roche, which run on the cobas e systems. These fully automated systems can provide test results in 18 minutes for a single test (excluding time for sample collection, transport, and preparation), with a throughput of up to 300 tests per hour from a single analyser, depending on the analyser.1

About antigen testing
An antigen test detects proteins which are structural or functional components of a pathogen and are thus very specific to that pathogen.2 In this case, the test would provide a qualitative “yes/no” answer on the presence of the pathogen in the patient sample. If the target antigen is present in sufficient concentrations in the sample, it will bind to specific antibodies and generate a positive result, indicating an active infection.3

In general, antigen tests have a high specificity, though are not as sensitive as PCR tests that amplify the target viral DNA or RNA sequence in order to generate a quantifiable signal to indicate the presence of the virus in a sample. Therefore, to make up for the potential decrease in sensitivity of an antigen test, negative results should be analysed together with additional patient factors, such as COVID-19 exposure history, clinical symptoms, additional test results to help guide the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of the patient.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
As a leading healthcare company we are doing all we can to support countries in minimising the impact of COVID-19. We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help to detect and diagnose the infection in patients, as well as providing digital support to healthcare systems, and we continue to identify, develop and support potential therapies which can play a role in treating the disease.

We understand the impact of COVID-19 goes beyond those who contract it, which is why we are working with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need during these challenging times. As we learn from the pandemic, we are partnering with governments and others to make healthcare stronger and more sustainable in the future.

Our diagnostics solutions:
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. Our portfolio includes:

a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, (FDA Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) and available in countries accepting the CE Mark)
a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-based antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood targeting the nucleocapsid (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
an IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19 (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic
a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test to help determine at the point of care whether a person has been exposed to the virus (CE Mark)
a rapid antigen test to support in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care within 15 minutes (CE Mark)
a high-volume molecular test to simultaneously detect and differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B, as the symptoms are similar for both (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
a second SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, aimed at measuring the spike protein to support vaccination development and complement our existing portfolio
a point-of-care molecular PCR test that simultaneously detects and differentiates between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B infections to support urgent triage and diagnosis (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
Our research into therapies:
Roche is committed to improving the treatment of COVID-19. We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are exploring the potential of our investigational molecules.

In August we signed a collaboration agreement with Regeneron on developing and manufacturing and significantly increasing global supply of an investigational antibody combination for COVID-19 if it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted. We are also partnering with Atea to jointly develop AT-527, an orally administered direct-acting antiviral (DAA) currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. If approved, Atea will distribute AT-527 in the United States and Roche will be responsible for global manufacturing and distribution outside the United States.

At the beginning of the pandemic, on 19 March on 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA – a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. On 29 July we announced that COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia or the key secondary endpoint of reduced mortality.

Separately, we have studied Actemra©/RoActemra© in the EMPACTA study in COVID-19 associated hospitalised pneumonia in patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials. On 18 September we announced that the phase III EMPACTA study showed Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care reduced the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. However, there was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra/RoActemra or placebo.

Actemra©/RoActemra© is also being studied in combination with the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the REMDACTA trial in partnership with Gilead, announced 28 May. Actemra©/RoActemra© is not approved by any health authority for use in COVID-19 pneumonia. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

53501,Chugai In-Licenses Roche's Antibody Cocktail for COVID-19 in Japan,Chugai in-licenses Antibody Cocktail for COVID-19 from Roche,"Chugai get an exclusive development and commercialization agreement in Japan for Roche’s Ab cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab to combat COVID-19
 Earlier, Roche & Regeneron collaborated for the development & commercialization of Ab cocktail where Regeneron will distribute the treatment in the US while Roche will be lead manufacturing and distribution activities outside the US
 The combination regimen is being studied globally in a P-II/III study for patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization, in P-II/III clinical study for non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and P-III clinical study for prevention of infection in COVID-19 household contacts","TOKYO, December 10, 2020 — Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 4519) announced today that it concluded a license agreement with Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) for the development and commercialization in Japan for the antibody cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab (formerly known as REGN-COV2) for COVID-19.

The antibody cocktail combining two virus neutralizing antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, was created by Regeneron for the potential treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Roche and Regeneron are collaborating on developing and commercializing casirivimab and imdevimab. As part of the agreement, Regeneron will distribute the treatment in the U.S. while Roche will be responsible for manufacturing and distribution outside the U.S. Under the license agreement between Chugai and Roche, Chugai obtained development and exclusive commercialization rights in Japan for casirivimab and imdevimab.

The casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail is currently being studied globally in a phase II/III clinical study for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization, a phase II/III clinical study for the treatment of non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and a phase III clinical study for prevention of infection in COVID-19 household contacts. A phase III open-label clinical study for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization is also ongoing in the U.K. (the ‘RECOVERY’ trial). In November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization for casirivimab and imdevimab for the treatment of certain high-risk, non-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

“We are pleased that Chugai can join forces with Roche and Regeneron to provide a potential treatment to fight COVID-19, a disease that has brought unprecedented harm to people’s health and lives as well as disruption to all areas of society,” said Chugai’s President and COO, Dr. Osamu Okuda. “We are committed to delivering the product to people in Japan as soon as possible.”

About casirivimab and imdevimab

Casirivimab and imdevimab were designed specifically by Regeneron scientists to block the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. They evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company’s proprietary VelocImmune® mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies identified from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies administered together, bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein, which may help diminish the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population1.

53516,AstraZeneca to Acquire Alexion for $39B,"AstraZeneca to Acquire Alexion, Accelerating the Company’s Strategic and Financial Development","Alexion to receive $60M in cash and 2.1243 ADSs (each ADS represents ½ ordinary share of AstraZeneca) for each Alexion share. The deal values Alexion at $175/ share with a 45% premium to the closing price on Dec 11, 2020
 Alexion will own ~15% of the combined company. The acquisition will bolster AstraZeneca’s footprints in rare disease and enhance its presence in immunology
 The duo will work together to build Alexion’s pipeline of 11 molecules across 20+ clinical- programs in rare diseases and beyond. The new company will lead to a WW expansion of Alexion’s portfolio and is expected to deliver double-digit average annual revenue growth through 2025","CAMBRIDGE, England & BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–AstraZeneca and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) have entered into a definitive agreement for AstraZeneca to acquire Alexion.

Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares (ADSs) (each ADS representing one-half of one (1/2) ordinary share of AstraZeneca, as evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)) for each Alexion share. Based on AstraZeneca’s reference average ADR price of $54.14, this implies total consideration to Alexion shareholders of $39bn or $175 per share.

The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the acquisition. Subject to receipt of regulatory clearances and approval by shareholders of both companies, the acquisition is expected to close in Q3 2021, and upon completion, Alexion shareholders will own c.15% of the combined company.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “Alexion has established itself as a leader in complement biology, bringing life-changing benefits to patients with rare diseases. This acquisition allows us to enhance our presence in immunology. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues at Alexion so that we can together build on our combined expertise in immunology and precision medicines to drive innovation that delivers life-changing medicines for more patients.”

Ludwig Hantson, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, Alexion, said: “For nearly 30 years Alexion has worked to develop and deliver transformative medicines to patients around the world with rare and devastating diseases. I am incredibly proud of what our organisation has accomplished and am grateful to our employees for their contributions. This transaction marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Alexion. We bring to AstraZeneca a strong portfolio, innovative rare disease pipeline, a talented global workforce and strong manufacturing capabilities in biologics. We remain committed to continuing to serve the patients who rely on our medicines and firmly believe the combined organisation will be well positioned to accelerate innovation and deliver enhanced value for our shareholders, patients and the rare disease communities.”

Strategic rationale

Both companies share the same dedication to science and innovation to deliver life-changing medicines. The capabilities of both organisations will create a company with great strengths across a range of technology platforms, with the ability to bring innovative medicines to millions of people worldwide. The combined company will also have an enhanced global footprint and broad coverage across primary, speciality and highly specialised care.

Scientific leadership – accelerated presence in immunology

AstraZeneca has built a growing scientific presence in oncology, and in cardiovascular, renal and metabolism, and respiratory diseases, with a focus on organ protection. AstraZeneca has developed a broad range of technologies, initially focused on small molecules and biologics and with a growing focus in precision medicine, genomics, oligonucleotides and epigenetics. More recently, AstraZeneca has increased its efforts in immunology research and the development of medicines for immune-mediated diseases.

Alexion has pioneered complement inhibition for a broad spectrum of immune-mediated rare diseases caused by uncontrolled activation of the complement system, a vital part of the immune system. Alexion’s franchise includes Soliris (eculizumab), a first-in-class anti-complement component 5 (C5) monoclonal antibody. The medicine is approved in many countries for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome, generalized myasthenia gravis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. More recently, Alexion launched Ultomiris (ravulizumab), a second-generation C5 monoclonal antibody with a more convenient dosing regimen.

Alexion’s immunology expertise extends to other targets in the complement cascade beyond C5 as well as additional modalities, with its deep pipeline including Factor D small-molecule inhibitors of the alternative pathway of the complement system, an antibody blocking neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling, and a bi-specific mini-body targeting C5, among others. The FcRn extends the half-life and hence the availability of pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.

AstraZeneca, with Alexion’s R&D team, will work to build on Alexion’s pipeline of 11 molecules across more than 20 clinical-development programmes across the spectrum of indications, in rare diseases and beyond.

Alexion’s leading expertise in complement biology will accelerate AstraZeneca’s growing presence in immunology. The acquisition adds a new technology platform to AstraZeneca’s science and innovation-driven strategy. The complement cascade is pivotal to the innate immune system. It plays a crucial role in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases across multiple therapy areas, including haematology, nephrology, neurology, metabolic disorders, cardiology, ophthalmology and acute care. In contrast, AstraZeneca’s capabilities in genomics, precision medicine and oligonucleotides can be leveraged to develop medicines targeting less-frequent diseases. Combining AstraZeneca’s capabilities in precision medicine and Alexion’s expertise in rare-disease development and commercialisation will enable the new company to develop a portfolio of medicines addressing the large unmet needs of patients suffering from rare diseases.

The combined companies will bring together two rapidly converging, patient-centric models of care delivery with combined strengths in immunology, biologics, genomics and oligonucleotides to drive future medicine innovation. AstraZeneca intends to establish Boston, Massachusetts, US as its headquarters for rare diseases, capitalising on talent in the greater Boston area.

Industry-leading revenue growth; enhanced geographical presence and broad coverage across primary, specialised and highly specialised care

AstraZeneca’s acquisition of Alexion, with its strong commercial portfolio and robust pipeline, will support its long-term ambition to develop novel medicines in areas of immunology with high unmet medical needs. Alexion achieved impressive revenue growth over the last few years, with revenues of $5.0bn in 2019 (21% year-on-year growth). Alexion has exhibited skilful commercial execution in building its ‘blockbuster’ C5 franchise. The success of the franchise is demonstrated by the effective transition of over 70% of PNH patients from Soliris to Ultomiris in less than two years of launch in its key markets, including the US, Japan and Germany, as well as the strong pipeline of additional indications for Ultomiris.

Rare diseases is a high-growth therapy area with rapid innovation and significant unmet medical need. Over 7,000 rare diseases are known today, and only c.5% have US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments.1 The global rare disease market is forecasted to grow by a low double digit percentage in the future.2

AstraZeneca intends to build on its geographical footprint and extensive emerging markets presence to accelerate the worldwide expansion of Alexion’s portfolio.

The two companies have been on converging paths, AstraZeneca expanding its presence from primary to speciality care, whereas Alexion has been progressing from ultra-orphan to orphan and speciality conditions.

The acquisition strengthens AstraZeneca’s industry-leading growth, underpinned by its broad portfolio of medicines, which will enable the new company to bring innovative medicines to a broad range of healthcare practitioners in primary, speciality and highly specialised care.

The combined company is expected to deliver double-digit average annual revenue growth through 2025.

Financial benefits

Enhanced revenue growth, operating margin and cash-flow generation

The acquisition is expected to improve the combined Group’s profitability, with the core operating margin significantly enhanced in the short term, and with continued expansion thereafter. This uplift is supported by increased scale and expected recurring run-rate pre-tax synergies of c.$500m per year from the combined Group (by end of the third year following completion of the acquisition). AstraZeneca expects to generate significant value from the acquisition by extending Alexion’s commercial reach through leveraging AstraZeneca’s global presence and accelerating the development of Alexion’s pipeline.

The acquisition also strengthens AstraZeneca’s cash-flow generation, providing additional flexibility to reinvest in R&D and rapid debt reduction, with an ambition to increase the dividend.

Immediately earnings-accretive and value-enhancing acquisition, in line with stated capital-allocation priorities

The acquisition is expected to deliver robust and sustainable accretion to AstraZeneca’s core earnings per share (EPS) from the outset, with double-digit percentage accretion anticipated in the first three years following the completion of the acquisition.

The acquisition of Alexion is consistent with AstraZeneca’s capital-allocation priorities. The combined company is expected to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating, and the acquisition supports AstraZeneca’s progressive dividend policy. The combination represents a significant step in AstraZeneca’s strategic and financial-growth plans.

Details of the acquisition

Key terms

The acquisition will be undertaken through a US statutory merger in which Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 new AstraZeneca ADSs listed on the Nasdaq exchange for each of their Alexion shares. The cash and ADS consideration represents an c.45% premium to Alexion shareholders based on the closing stock price of Alexion on 11 December 2020 and a c.43% premium, based on the 30-day volume-weighted average closing stock price of $122.04 before this announcement. If they elect, Alexion shareholders may receive their allocation of AstraZeneca ADSs in the form of a corresponding number of ordinary shares of AstraZeneca in addition to the cash consideration.

Based on AstraZeneca’s reference average ADR price of $54.14, this implies total consideration to Alexion shareholders of $39bn or $175 per share.

Financing

To support the financing of the offer consideration, AstraZeneca has entered into a new committed $17.5bn bridge-financing facility, provided by Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Securities plc and Goldman Sachs. The bridge-financing facility is available for an initial term of 12 months from the earlier of the date of completion of the acquisition and 12 December 2021 with up to two six-month extensions available at the discretion of AstraZeneca. The initial bridge financing facility is intended to cover the financing of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration and associated acquisition costs and to refinance the existing term loan and revolving credit facilities of Alexion. In due course, AstraZeneca intends to refinance the initial bridge-financing facility through a combination of new medium-term bank loan facilities, debt-capital market issuances and business cash flows.

The acquisition is expected to significantly enhance cash generation, which will support rapid debt reduction and overall deleveraging. AstraZeneca remains committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating. The dividend policy remains unchanged with a commitment to a progressive dividend policy; dividend cover is expected to be materially enhanced as a result of the acquisition.

Further information on synergies

The acquisition is expected to realise recurring run-rate pre-tax synergies of c.$500m per year from the combined Group, generated from commercial and manufacturing efficiencies as well as savings in central costs, with full run-rate expected to be achieved by end of the third year following completion of the acquisition.

To realise the total synergies, AstraZeneca expects to incur one-time cash costs of c.$650m, during the first three years following completion.

Management and employees

Members of Alexion’s current senior management team will lead the future rare-disease activities. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, AstraZeneca has agreed that for 12 months following closing, it will provide the Alexion employees with the same level of salary as such employees had before closing, incentive compensation opportunities that are in the aggregate no less favourable than those provided before closing and substantially comparable benefits to those provided before closing.

Governance

The companies will mutually agree on two individuals from the Alexion board of directors who will join the AstraZeneca board as directors upon closing of the acquisition.

Closing conditions

Closing of the acquisition is subject to approval by AstraZeneca and Alexion shareholders, certain regulatory approvals, approval of the new AstraZeneca shares for listing with the Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange, and other customary closing conditions.

The acquisition is a Class 1 transaction for AstraZeneca and as such, will require the approval of its shareholders to comply with the UK Listing Rules. A shareholder circular, together with notice of the relevant shareholder meeting, will be distributed to shareholders in the first half of 2021. The Alexion proxy statement is also expected to be published in the first half of 2021.

Subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the proposed acquisition, the companies expect the acquisition to close in Q3 2021.

Termination

The acquisition terms provide that Alexion will be liable to pay a break fee of up to $1.2bn to AstraZeneca in certain specified circumstances (including a change of Alexion’s board recommendation or completion of an alternative acquisition). AstraZeneca will also be required to pay Alexion a break fee of $1.4bn in certain specified circumstances, including a change of AstraZeneca’s board recommendation.

Recommendation

The boards of directors of both Alexion and AstraZeneca have unanimously approved the proposed acquisition and resolved to recommend that their respective shareholders vote in favour of it.

53522,Pfizer and BioNTech's BNT162b2 Receives the US FDA's EUA to Prevent COVID-19,Pfizer and BioNTech Celebrate Historic First Authorization in the U.S. of Vaccine to Prevent COVID-19,"Pfizer & BioNTech received the US FDA’s EUA for BNT162b2 for patients aged ≥16yrs with COVID-19. The companies are gathering additional data & prepared to file a planned BLA with the US FDA anticipating full approval in 2021
 The EUA is based on P-III pivotal study demonstrating 95% efficacy in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection & also in participants with/ out prior infection
 In Jul 2020, the companies collaborated with the HHS & DoD to meet the Operation Warp Speed program goal to deliver doses of a vaccine for COVID-19","NEW YORK & MAINZ, Germany–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the emergency use of the mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2, against COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age or older. The vaccine is now authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) while Pfizer and BioNTech gather additional data and prepare to file a planned Biologics License Application (BLA) with the FDA for a possible full regulatory approval in 2021.

Under Operation Warp Speed, the Department of Defense (DoD) in partnership with agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will manage allocation and distribution of the vaccine in the U.S. This will be prioritized according to the populations identified by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines.

“Pfizer’s purpose is breakthroughs that change patients’ lives, and in our 171-year history there has never been a more urgent need for a breakthrough than today with hundreds of thousands of people continuing to suffer from COVID-19,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “As a U.S. company, today’s news brings great pride and tremendous joy that Pfizer has risen to the challenge to develop a vaccine that has the potential to help bring an end to this devastating pandemic. We have worked tirelessly to make the impossible possible, steadfast in our belief that science will win.”

“We founded BioNTech to develop new technologies and medicines that utilize the full potential of the immune system to fight serious diseases,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “Today we are another step closer to our vision. We believe that today’s Emergency Use Authorization, and the subsequent distribution of our vaccine that has demonstrated an efficacy rate of 95% and a favorable safety profile, will help to save lives across the United States and could accelerate a return to normality.”

The FDA based its decision on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the companies, including data from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study announced last month and published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine. The Phase 3 data demonstrated a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and also in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from 7 days after the second dose. The Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. All trial participants will continue to be monitored to assess long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose.

Pfizer and BioNTech appreciate the continued participation of the approximately 44,000 trial volunteers and remain committed to the companies’ pledge to always make their safety and well-being the companies’ top priority. The participants in our COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial are courageous volunteers who have made a personal and important choice to help make a difference during this pandemic. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to provide an option for trial participants who received the placebo to receive the vaccine at scheduled timepoints in the study. This vaccine transition option will be voluntary and will be implemented in alignment with the regulatory authorities where the trial is conducted.

In July 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced an agreement with the HHS and the DoD to meet the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program goal to deliver doses of a vaccine for COVID-19. With the vaccine being authorized for emergency use in the U.S., the companies will begin delivering the first doses in the U.S. immediately, with delivery fulfillment expected to be completed in 2021.

About the Phase 2/3 Study

The ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2, which is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, has enrolled more than 44,000 participants, the vast majority of whom have received their second dose. A breakdown of the diversity of clinical trial participants can be found here from more than 150 clinical trial sites in the U.S., Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina.

The Phase 3 trial is designed as a 1:1 vaccine candidate to placebo, randomized, observer-blinded study to obtain safety, immune response, and efficacy data needed for regulatory review. The trial’s primary endpoints are prevention of COVID-19 in those who have not been infected by SARS-CoV-2 prior to immunization, and prevention of COVID-19 regardless of whether participants have previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Secondary endpoints include prevention of severe COVID-19 in those groups. The study also will explore prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Data from this study, including longer term safety, comprehensive information on duration of protection, efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and safety and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age will be gathered in the months ahead. Additional studies are planned to evaluate BNT162b2 in pregnant women, children younger than 12 years, and those in special risk groups, such as the immunocompromised.

Manufacturing and Delivery Capabilities

Pfizer and BioNTech continue to work in collaboration with governments and Ministries of Health around the world that will distribute the vaccine, subject to country authorization or approval and terms of supply agreements, to help ensure it can reach those most in need as quickly as possible. The companies are leveraging Pfizer’s leading vaccine manufacturing and distribution capabilities to quickly scale, manufacture and distribute large quantities of the vaccine at high quality, complementing BioNTech’s mRNA manufacturing expertise gained over almost a decade. Pfizer has a 171-year track record of researching, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative medicines and vaccines to patients in need. Pfizer and BioNTech are confident in their ability to deliver the vaccine to people in the U.S. Based on current projections, Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s combined manufacturing network has the potential to supply globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021 (subject to manufacturing capacity and regulatory approval or authorization).

Pfizer is leveraging three of its U.S. manufacturing sites to produce the COVID-19 vaccine – Saint Louis, Missouri, Andover, Massachusetts, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. Pfizer’s Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin and Puurs, Belgium sites are also being used.

Pfizer has vast experience and expertise in cold-chain shipping and has an established infrastructure to supply the vaccine worldwide, including distribution hubs that can store vaccine doses for up to six months. The company’s distribution is built on a flexible just-in-time system that can ship the frozen vials quickly to designated points of vaccination at the time of need, minimizing the need for long term storage. Vaccination in a pandemic situation is expected to be rapid, and we do not expect that the product will need to be stored at any location for more than 30 days. To assure product quality, the companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers for the vaccine, which can maintain recommended storage conditions (-70°C ±10°C) for extended periods of time with dry ice. The shipper can maintain temperature for 10 days unopened which allows for transportation to markets globally. Once open, a vaccination center may use the specially designed shippers as a temporary storage solution to maintain the recommended storage conditions (-70°C ±10°C) up to 30 days with re-icing every five days in accordance with the handling instructions. Each shipper contains a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of each vaccine shipment 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored safely for up to five days at refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions.

From the start of the research program earlier this year, Pfizer and BioNTech have successfully supplied and distributed their investigational vaccine to more than 150 clinical trial sites across the U.S., as well as Europe, Latin America and South Africa reaching approximately 44,000 participants. Based on their collective experience, the companies believe in their capability to distribute the vaccine globally upon approval or authorization. BioNTech will hold the regulatory approvals in the U.S., U.K., Canada and, if authorized, in the EU, and other countries. Pfizer will have marketing and distribution rights worldwide with the exception of China, Germany, and Turkey.

53533,AstraZeneca's Trixeo Aerosphere Receives EU's Approval for the Maintenance Treatment of COPD,Trixeo Aerosphere approved in the EU for maintenance treatment of COPD,"The approval is based on P-lll ETHOS involve the assessing of Trixeo Aerosphere (formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide/budesonide) vs Bevespi Aerosphere and PT009 in adult patients with mod. to sev. COPD. P-III KRONOS study also supported the approval
 The study showed a reduction in rate of mod. or sev. exacerbations. EMA’s CHMP has recommended the MAA for Trixeo Aerosphere in Oct’2020
 Trixeo Aerosphere is a single-inhaler, fixed-dose triple-combination of formoterol fumarate LABA, LAMA, with budesonide, an ICS, and delivered in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler. The approval marks the fourth major approval of the therapy","AstraZeneca’s Trixeo Aerosphere (formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide/budesonide) has been approved in the European Union (EU) for maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), or a combination of a LABA and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA).

The approval by the European Commission was based on positive results from the ETHOS Phase III trial in which Trixeo Aerosphere, a triple-combination therapy, showed a statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with dual-combination therapies Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) and PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate) over 52 weeks.1 The approval was also supported by efficacy and safety data from the KRONOS Phase III trial.2

Trixeo Aerosphere was recommended for marketing authorisation by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency in October 2020.

COPD is a progressive disease, which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness and is the third leading cause of death globally.3-6

Klaus Rabe, Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at the University of Kiel, Director of the Department of Pneumology at Clinic Grosshansdorf, Germany, and lead investigator of the ETHOS Phase III trial, said: “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease significantly contributes to morbidity and healthcare resource utilisation in Europe. Even a single exacerbation can cause further deterioration of a patient’s lung function and increase the risk of hospitalisation, so preventing exacerbations is a clinical priority. Trixeo Aerosphere has demonstrated significant benefits in reducing exacerbations in patients with moderate to severe disease, and triple-combination therapy will play an increasingly important clinical role in treating these patients.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Trixeo Aerosphere has a strong clinical profile compared with dual-combination therapies and offers an important new treatment option for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In Europe, about one in 10 adults over the age of 40 has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with prevalence increasing. We look forward to discussing all-cause mortality data from the ETHOS Phase III trial with health authorities.”

Results from the ETHOS Phase III trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in June 20201 and results from the KRONOS Phase III trial were published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine in September 2018.2 In both trials, the safety and tolerability of Trixeo Aerosphere were consistent with the profiles of the dual comparators.1,2

COPD

COPD is a progressive disease which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness.3,4,5 It affects an estimated 384 million people7 and is the third leading cause of death globally.6 In Europe, approximately 10% of adults over the age of 40 have COPD, with prevalence set to increase,8,9 significantly contributing to morbidity3 and healthcare resource utilisation.10 Improving lung function, reducing exacerbations and managing daily symptoms such as breathlessness are important treatment goals in the management of COPD.3 A single COPD exacerbation can have a negative impact on lung function,11,12 quality of life13 and increase the risk of hospitalisation.14 Additionally, even one COPD exacerbation that results in hospitalisation increases the risk of death.15,16

ATHENA clinical trial programme

The ETHOS and KRONOS Phase III trials are part of AstraZeneca’s ATHENA Phase III clinical trial programme for Trixeo Aerosphere, which included more than 15,500 patients globally across 11 trials.

ETHOS is a randomised, double-blinded, multi-centre, parallel-group, 52-week Phase III trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Trixeo Aerosphere in symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbation(s) in the previous year. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations.1 Results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.1

KRONOS is a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre Phase III trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Trixeo Aerosphere in patients with moderate to very severe COPD regardless of whether or not they had an exacerbation in the previous year. The primary endpoints were lung function parameters.2 Results were published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.2

Trixeo Aerosphere

Trixeo Aerosphere (formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide/budesonide) is a single-inhaler, fixed-dose triple-combination of formoterol fumarate, a LABA, glycopyrronium bromide, a LAMA, with budesonide, an ICS, and delivered in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler.

Trixeo Aerosphere is approved under the brand name Breztri Aerosphere in Japan, China and the US for patients with COPD.

AstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology

Respiratory & Immunology is one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company.

Building on a 50-year heritage, AstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care, across inhaled and biologic medicines. AstraZeneca aims to transform the treatment of asthma and COPD by eliminating preventable asthma attacks across all severities and removing COPD as a leading cause of death through earlier biology-led treatment. The Company’s early respiratory research is focused on emerging science involving immune mechanisms, lung damage and abnormal cell-repair processes in disease and neuronal dysfunction.

With common pathways and underlying disease drivers across respiratory and immunology, AstraZeneca is following the science from chronic lung diseases to immunology-driven disease areas. The Company’s growing presence in immunology is focused on five mid- to late-stage franchises with multi-disease potential in rheumatology (including systemic lupus erythematosus), dermatology, gastroenterology, and systemic eosinophilic-driven diseases. AstraZeneca’s ambition in immunology is to achieve disease control and ultimately clinical remission in targeted immune-driven diseases.

53540,Novartis' Ruxolitinib Fails to Meet its Primary Endpoint in P-lll RUXCOVID Study for COVID-19,Novartis provides update on RUXCOVID study of ruxolitinib for hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"The P-lll RUXCOVID study involves assessing Ruxolitinib (5mg, bid) + SoC therapy vs PBO + SoC therapy in 432 patients aged ≥12 yrs. in a ratio (2:1) hospitalized for COVID-19 and not intubated or receiving ICU care prior to randomization
 The study did not meet its 1EPS of reducing the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who experienced severe complications @29days (death, mechanical ventilation or ICU care i.e. (12% vs 11.8%). The trial did not show benefits among 2EPs and exploratory endpoints including mortality rate @Day29 and time to recovery
 Ruxolitinib is an oral JAK 1 and JAK 2 tyrosine kinases inhibitor and is approved under the name Jakavi in EU and other countries for PV & MF","Basel, December 14, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the Phase III RUXCOVID study evaluating ruxolitinib on top of standard of care (SoC) therapy compared to SoC treatment alone in patients with COVID-19 did not meet its primary endpoint1. Initial data show there was no statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients on ruxolitinib plus SoC therapy who experienced severe complications, including death, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) by Day 29, compared to SoC alone1. The trial also did not show clinically relevant benefit among secondary and exploratory endpoints including mortality rate by Day 29, and time to recovery (no longer infected, or ambulatory with no or minimal limitations)1.

“While the RUXCOVID trial did not give us the results we hoped for, we will continue working with the medical community to analyze its findings to better understand COVID-19 and the role of JAK inhibition,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “We would like to thank the front-line clinical teams and staff at each of the trial sites and the hundreds of patients who volunteered to participate and their loved ones. We are deeply grateful to them and will continue our dedicated scientific research into the ongoing global pandemic.”

In the trial, the proportion of patients who died, or required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure or ICU care by Day 29, the primary endpoint, was 12.0% for ruxolitinib plus SoC vs. 11.8% for placebo plus SoC (OR: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.48-1.73]; p=0.769)1. Ruxolitinib was generally well-tolerated, and a comprehensive analysis including safety data is ongoing1. The results of RUXCOVID do not affect any ongoing trials for ruxolitinib in non-COVID-19 diseases.

About RUXCOVID
RUXCOVID (NCT04362137) is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 29-day study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib plus standard of care (SoC) therapy compared to placebo plus SoC therapy in patients aged ≥12 years hospitalized for COVID-19 and not intubated or receiving ICU care prior to randomization. The study has enrolled 432 patients globally2.

The composite primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who die, develop respiratory failure (require mechanical ventilation), or require admission to ICU by Day 29. Secondary endpoints include various efficacy assessments including evaluation of clinical status using a 9-point ordinal scale; in-hospital outcomes (mortality rate; proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation; duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation); change in the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2); change in SpO2/FiO2 ratio; proportion of patients with no oxygen therapy (oxygen saturation of ≥94% on room air); and safety. The exploratory endpoint of time to recovery (no longer infected, or ambulatory with no or minimal limitations) was also evaluated2.

Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive oral ruxolitinib 5mg twice daily (BID) or oral-matching placebo for a total of 14 days. Study treatment is given in combination with SoC therapy according to the investigator’s clinical judgement. After 14 days of therapy, should clinical signs or symptoms not improve or worsen, and the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks, patients may receive an additional 14 days of study therapy. In total, patients are followed on study for 29 days post-randomization2.

RUXCOVID is sponsored by Novartis outside of the US and by Incyte in the US.

About ruxolitinib

Novartis response to COVID-19 pandemic
Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis is active in several key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)4. Novartis has also announced a collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-195, and the company is separately supporting COVID-19-related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. Two medicines in early stage development are also being investigated focusing on stopping or slowing the body’s overactive immune response to COVID-196,7. In our labs, we have started a collaborative, longer-term drug discovery effort to develop an antiviral molecule to potentially treat all coronaviruses. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low-and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is found. This includes dexamethasone, which is the only medicine shown to decrease mortality so far in severe hospitalized COVID pneumonia4. Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID8. More information about the Novartis response to COVID-19 is available at www.novartis.com/coronavirus.

53547,Daiichi Sankyo and AZ's Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Receives CHMP's Recommendation for Approval to Treat HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer,Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Recommended for Approval in the EU by CHMP for HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer,"The recommendation is based on a P-II DESTINY-Breast01 study assessing trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2 positive unresectable/ m-BC prior treated with trastuzumab emtansine
 The trial demonstrated a meaningful & durable activity in patients who had received two or more prior anti-HER2 therapies. The safety & tolerability profile of the therapy was consistent with the P-I trial
 EC will review the CHMP’s positive opinion to grant MAA for the therapy in the EU. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a HER2 directed ADC","TOKYO & MUNICH–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca’s trastuzumab deruxtecan has been recommended for conditional marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.

In Europe, approximately 520,000 cases of breast cancer in women are diagnosed annually, with roughly one in five cases being HER2 positive.1,2 The impact of the disease is significant, with breast cancer responsible for more than 137,000 deaths per year.1

Following review of the application under its accelerated assessment procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) based its positive opinion on results from the pivotal phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 trial, which were published in The New England Journal of Medicine, and the results from the phase 1 trial published in The Lancet Oncology. In the DESTINY-Breast01 trial, trastuzumab deruxtecan demonstrated clinically meaningful and durable activity in patients who had received two or more prior anti-HER2 therapies. The safety and tolerability profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan seen in DESTINY-Breast01 was consistent with that observed in the phase 1 trial.

An updated analysis from DESTINY-Breast01, reinforcing the durable efficacy and long-term safety and tolerability profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan, was presented earlier this week at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS).

“We are encouraged by the CHMP positive opinion given the significant unmet need for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “Trastuzumab deruxtecan is already available for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer in the U.S. and Japan, and we are now one step closer to bringing this important new medicine to patients in Europe.”

“The durable responses demonstrated in the DESTINY-Breast01 trial have never been seen before in this patient setting,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “If approved by the European Commission, physicians in Europe will have an important new treatment option for patients with previously treated HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.”

The CHMP positive opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to grant marketing authorizations for medicines in the EU.

About HER2 Positive Breast Cancer

Approximately 520,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in Europe annually, with an estimated one in five cases being HER2 positive.1,2

HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors, including breast, gastric and lung cancers. HER2 overexpression may be associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as HER2 amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in breast cancer.3

There remain significant unmet clinical needs for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. The disease remains incurable with patients eventually progressing after currently available treatment options.4,5

About DESTINY-Breast01

DESTINY-Breast01 is a pivotal phase 2, single-arm, open-label, global, multicenter, two-part trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate, as determined by independent central review. Secondary objectives include duration of response, disease control rate, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival and overall survival.

About Trastuzumab Deruxtecan

Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, trastuzumab deruxtecan is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.

ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy, based on the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial.

About the Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Clinical Development Program

A comprehensive development program is underway globally, with nine pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers, including breast, gastric, colorectal and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.

In October 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan was granted Priority Review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. In May 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) and Orphan Drug Designation for gastric cancer, including GEJ adenocarcinoma.

In July 2020, the EMA’s CHMP granted trastuzumab deruxtecan accelerated assessment for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.

In May 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan had also received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.

About the Collaboration Between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca

Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize trastuzumab deruxtecan (a HER2 directed ADC) in March 2019, and datopotamab deruxtecan (DS-1062; a TROP2 directed ADC) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of trastuzumab deruxtecan and datopotamab deruxtecan.

53568,Genentech's Ocrevus Shorter 2-Hour Infusion Receives the US FDA's Approval for Relapsing & Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,FDA Approves Genentech’s Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) Shorter 2-Hour Infusion for Relapsing and Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,"The approval is based on ENSEMBLE PLUS study, which demonstrated similar frequency and severity of IRRs for 2hrs. Ocrevus infusion time vs conventional 3.5hrs in patients with RRMS. The initial dose is given as two 300mg infusions given 2wks. apart and a subsequent dose of single 600mg infusions were administered over a shorter, 2hrs. time
 Results: frequency of IRRs post 600mg infusion (24.6% vs 23.1%), majority of IRRs were mild or moderate, and >98% resolved in both groups without complication
 Ocrevus is a humanized mAb designed to target CD20-positive B cells and is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS and PPMS","SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a shorter two-hour infusion time for Ocrevus® (ocrelizumab), dosed twice-yearly for those living with relapsing or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) who have not experienced any prior serious infusion reactions (IRs). The approval was based on data from the randomized, double-blind ENSEMBLE PLUS study. “More than 170,000 people with MS have been treated with Ocrevus – the only approved B-cell therapy with a twice-yearly dosing schedule – and it is the most prescribed MS medicine in the U.S.,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We constantly strive to improve the experience that patients and their physicians have with our medicines, and we believe people with relapsing and primary progressive MS will find the shorter two-hour Ocrevus infusion time to be more convenient.” The ENSEMBLE PLUS study showed similar frequency and severity of IRs for a two-hour Ocrevus infusion time vs. the previously approved 3.5-hour time in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). The first dose was administered per the approved dosing schedule (two 300 mg intravenous [IV] infusions separated by two weeks) and the second or later doses (600 mg IV infusion) were administered over a shorter, two-hour time. The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients with IRs following the first randomized 600 mg infusion (frequency/severity assessed during and 24-hours post infusion). The frequency of IRs was comparable between those who received the two-hour infusion (24.6%) and those who received the 3.5-hour infusion (23.1%). The majority of IRs were mild or moderate, and more than 98% resolved in both groups without complication. No IRs were life-threatening, serious or fatal. No patients discontinued the study due to an IR and no new safety signals were detected. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the two-hour infusion time in May of 2020 based on a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Ocrevus has twice-yearly (six-monthly) dosing and is the first and only therapy approved for relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) (including RRMS and active, or relapsing, secondary progressive MS [SPMS], in addition to clinically isolated syndrome [CIS] in the U.S.) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). Ocrevus is approved in 94 countries across North America, South America, the Middle East, Europe, as well as in Australia. About multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects nearly one million people in the United States, for which there is currently no cure. MS occurs when the immune system abnormally attacks the insulation and support around nerve cells (myelin sheath) in the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, causing inflammation and consequent damage. This damage can cause a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, fatigue and difficulty seeing, and may eventually lead to disability. Most people with MS experience their first symptom between 20 and 40 years of age, making the disease the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in younger adults. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of the disease and is characterized by episodes of new or worsening signs or symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery. Approximately 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. The majority of people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), in which they experience steadily worsening disability over time. Relapsing forms of MS (RMS) include people with RRMS and people with SPMS who continue to experience relapses. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is a debilitating form of the disease marked by steadily worsening symptoms but typically without distinct relapses or periods of remission. Approximately 15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form of the disease. Until the FDA approval of Ocrevus, there had been no FDA approved treatments for PPMS. People with all forms of MS experience disease activity – inflammation in the nervous system and permanent loss of nerve cells in the brain – even when their clinical symptoms aren’t apparent or don’t appear to be getting worse. An important goal of treating MS is to reduce disease activity as soon as possible to slow how quickly a person’s disability progresses. Despite available disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), some people with RMS continue to experience disease activity and disability progression. About Ocrevus® (ocrelizumab) Ocrevus is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including clinically isolated syndrome, RRMS and active, or relapsing, SPMS) and PPMS, with dosing every six months. Ocrevus is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to target CD20-positive B cells, a specific type of immune cell thought to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage. This nerve cell damage can lead to disability in people with MS. Based on preclinical studies, Ocrevus binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, suggesting that important functions of the immune system may be preserved. Ocrevus is administered by intravenous infusion every six months. The initial dose is given as two 300 mg infusions given two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as single 600 mg infusions. Indications and Important Safety Information What is Ocrevus? Ocrevus is a prescription medicine used to treat: Relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults Primary progressive MS, in adults.

“Genentech has a longstanding commitment to understanding the underlying biology of KRAS, the most commonly mutated oncogene and an important driver of cancer growth,” said James Sabry, M.D., Ph.D., global head of pharma partnering, Roche. “We are excited to partner with Relay Therapeutics, and we believe that the combination of KRAS G12C and SHP2 inhibitors together represents a promising approach that we hope could become a new treatment option for patients with KRAS G12C mutant tumors.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Relay Therapeutics will receive $75 million in an upfront payment and is eligible to receive $25 million in additional near-term payments. Relay Therapeutics also has the right to opt in to a 50/50 U.S. profit/cost share on RLY-1971. If Relay elects to opt in, then Relay will be eligible to receive 50 percent of profits from U.S. sales and up to $410 million in additional ex-U.S. commercialization and sales-based milestone payments, as well as royalties on ex-U.S. net sales. If Relay Therapeutics elects not to opt in, then Relay will be eligible to receive up to $695 million in additional development, commercialization and sales-based milestones, as well as royalties on global net sales, anticipated to be in the low-to-mid-teens. In the event of regulatory approval of both RLY-1971 and GDC-6036 in combination, Relay Therapeutics is eligible to receive additional royalties. Relay Therapeutics retains the right to combine RLY-1971 with its selective FGFR2 and mutant-selective PI3Kα programs.

With the execution of this collaboration, Relay Therapeutics anticipates it will have cash and investments to sustain its operations through 2024.

About RLY-1971

RLY-1971 is a potent small molecule inhibitor of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2). SHP2 is a critical signaling node and regulator that promotes cancer cell survival and growth through the RAS pathway, playing a key role in the way cancer cells develop resistance to targeted therapies. Preclinically, RLY-1971 demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity as a monotherapy in cancers with specific alterations as well as in combination with other anti-tumor agents, potentially overcoming or delaying the onset of resistance to those therapies. RLY-1971 is currently being evaluated in a first-in-human trial designed to treat patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. To learn more about the first-in-human clinical trial of RLY-1971, please visit here.

CureVac N.V. (Nasdaq: CVAC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), announced today that it has enrolled the first participant in the pivotal Phase 2b/3 study of its mRNA vaccine candidate, CVnCoV, against COVID-19. The randomized, observer blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b/3 trial called HERALD will assess the safety and efficacy of CVnCoV in adults at a dose of 12 µg. The study is expected to include more than 35,000 participants at sites in Europe and Latin America.

“With the start of the pivotal Phase 2b/3 study, we have reached another important milestone in the development of our vaccine candidate, CVnCoV,” said Dr. Franz-Werner Haas, CEO of CureVac. “The clinical safety and immunogenicity data achieved to date look promising and we are hopeful that this trial will continue to demonstrate the impact of mRNA technology and our vaccine to prevent COVID-19, and to help defeat this pandemic.”

The HERALD trial will start with an initial Phase 2b part, which is expected to seamlessly merge into a Phase 3 efficacy trial. Subjects 18 years of age or older will be enrolled at multiple sites and will receive a two-dose schedule of either CVnCoV or placebo.

Besides the primary safety objective, the study design includes two primary efficacy objectives: the demonstration of the efficacy of CVnCoV in preventing first episodes of confirmed cases of COVID-19 of any severity, as well as preventing moderate to severe confirmed cases of COVID-19 in participants who have never been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Efficacy of CVnCoV will be assessed by an event-driven analysis based on a certain number of participants who present with laboratory confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease during the study. To ensure continued and close safety monitoring of the participants in the trial, data will be reviewed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board on a regular basis.

Following completion of the trial, subjects will continue to be monitored in a 1-year extension study. The extension study will collect additional data to evaluate long-term safety, persistence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the occurrence of COVID-19 cases to assess the duration of vaccine efficacy.

The study will be conducted in compliance with the requirements of the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).

About CVnCoV

CureVac began development of its mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate in January 2020. The compound is an optimized, non-chemically modified mRNA, encoding the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Phase 1 and 2a clinical trials of CVnCoV began in June and September 2020, respectively. Phase 1 interim data reported in November 2020 showed that CVnCoV was generally well tolerated across all tested doses and induced strong antibody responses in addition to first indication of T cell activation. The quality of immune response was comparable to recovered COVID-19 patients, closely mimicking the immune response after natural COVID-19 infection. The data supported CureVac’s decision to advance a 12µg dose in its pivotal Phase 2b/3 study. Clinical trial material is provided by the company’s substantial production capacities for mRNA vaccines at its headquarters in Tübingen, supported by the current expansion of manufacturing capacities in Europe to allow for broad-scale manufacturing of CVnCoV for potential commercial supply preparedness.

53596,EMA's CHMP Recommends Four-Week Dosing Option for AstraZeneca's Imfinzi to Treat Unresectable NSCLC,"Imfinzi recommended for approval in the EU by CHMP for less-frequent, fixed-dose use in unresectable non-small cell lung cancer","AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi durvalumab (1500mg, fd, q4w) is recommended for approval in the EU for an additional dosing option in the approved indication of LA, unresectable NSCLC in adults whose tumors express PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumor cells and whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based CRT
 The CHMP opinion is based on P-III PACIFIC trial that supported the 2wk, weight-based dosing of 10mg/kg q2w already approved in LA, unresectable NSCLC & the P-III CASPIAN trial which used fd, q4w during maintenance treatment in ES-SCLC
 The option would extend dosing from two to four weeks, reducing medical visits and improving patient convenience","AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) has been recommended for marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) for an additional dosing option, 1,500mg fixed dose every four weeks, in the approved indication of locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumour cells and whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy (CRT).

This new dosing option is consistent with the approved Imfinzi dosing in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and once approved, will be available to patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC weighing more than 30kg.

Following review of the application under its accelerated assessment procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency based its positive opinion on data from several Imfinzi clinical trials, including the PACIFIC Phase III trial which supported the two-week, weight-based dosing of 10mg/kg every two weeks already approved in locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC, and the CASPIAN Phase III trial which used fixed dosing every four weeks during maintenance treatment in ES-SCLC.

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “The four-week dosing regimen will decrease the risk of exposure to infection in the healthcare setting, furthering our efforts to ensure continuity of care for cancer patients at high risk of complications during the pandemic. We look forward to offering non-small cell lung cancer patients in Europe an option that would reduce medical visits by extending dosing from two to four weeks.”

Imfinzi was recently approved in the US for this dosing regimen. Imfinzi is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III (locally advanced) NSCLC after CRT in the EU, US, Japan, China and many other countries, based on the PACIFIC Phase III trial. Additionally, it is approved in the EU, US, Japan and many other countries around the world for the treatment of ES-SCLC based on the CASPIAN Phase III trial.

Stage III NSCLC

Stage III (locally advanced) NSCLC is commonly divided into three subcategories (IIIA, IIIB and IIIC), defined by how much the cancer has spread locally and the possibility of surgery.1 Stage III disease is different from Stage IV disease, when the cancer has spread (metastasised), as the majority of Stage III patients are currently treated with curative intent.1,2

Stage III NSCLC represents approximately one third of NSCLC incidence and in 2015 was estimated to affect nearly 200,000 patients in the following eight large countries: China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, and the US, with approximately 43,000 cases in the US alone.3,4 The majority of Stage III NSCLC patients are diagnosed with unresectable tumours.5 Prior to approval of Imfinzi in this setting, no new treatments beyond CRT had been available to patients for decades.6-8

Small cell lung cancer

SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly, despite initial response to chemotherapy.9,10 About two thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.11 Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.11

Imfinzi

Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

Imfinzi is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and several other countries.

As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combinations including with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.

AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action.

An extensive Immuno-Oncology (IO) development programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.12 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (POSEIDON and PEARL Phase III trials) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially-curative settings (MERMAID-1, MERMAID-2, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC Phase III trials) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy.

Imfinzi is also in development in the NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON Phase II trials in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline including Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan).

AstraZeneca’s approach to IO

IO is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes Imfinzi as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

The transaction is expected to be close in Q1’21
 The CVR is payable upon the first regulatory approval of a product from Prevail’s pipeline either in the US or any other country including Japan, UK, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. If approval occurs after Dec 31, 2024, the value of the CVR will be reduced by ~8.3% /month until Dec 1, 2028 (at which point the CVR will expire)
 The acquisition will establish a new modality at Lilly, extending its research in gene therapy program, anchored via Prevail’s pre/clinical neuroscience asset","INDIANAPOLIS and NEW YORK, Dec. 15, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: PRVL) today announced a definitive agreement for Lilly to acquire Prevail for $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $880 million) payable at closing plus one non-tradable contingent value right (“CVR”) worth up to $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million), for a total consideration of up to $26.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $1.040 billion). The CVR is payable (subject to certain terms and conditions) upon the first regulatory approval of a product from Prevail’s pipeline as set forth in more detail below. Prevail is a biotechnology company developing potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

The acquisition will establish a new modality for drug discovery and development at Lilly, extending Lilly’s research efforts through the creation of a gene therapy program that will be anchored by Prevail’s portfolio of clinical-stage and preclinical neuroscience assets. Prevail’s lead gene therapies in clinical development are PR001 for patients with Parkinson’s disease with GBA1 mutations (PD-GBA) and neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD) and PR006 for patients with frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutations (FTD-GRN). Prevail’s preclinical pipeline includes PR004 for patients with specific synucleinopathies, as well as potential gene therapies for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and other neurodegenerative disorders.

“Gene therapy is a promising approach with the potential to deliver transformative treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s, Gaucher and dementia,” said Mark Mintun, M.D., vice president of pain and neurodegeneration research at Lilly. “The acquisition of Prevail will bring critical technology and highly skilled teams to complement our existing expertise at Lilly, as we build a new gene therapy program anchored by well-researched assets. We look forward to completing the proposed acquisition and working with Prevail to advance their groundbreaking work through clinical development.”

“Lilly is an established leader in neuroscience drug development and commercialization who shares our commitment to patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and I’m excited for Prevail to join the Lilly family,” said Asa Abeliovich, M.D., Ph.D., founder and chief executive officer of Prevail. “I’m incredibly proud of the Prevail team, who have made great progress advancing our pipeline of gene therapy programs for patients with these devastating disorders. In just over three years, Prevail has advanced two first-in-class gene therapy programs into clinical development for PD-GBA, nGD, and FTD-GRN, established two manufacturing platforms, and developed a broad pipeline with great potential to impact patients in need of disease-modifying treatment options. With its global scale and resources, Lilly will be the ideal organization to maximize the potential of our pipeline and accelerate our ability to bring these therapies to as many patients as possible. We look forward to working together to advance our shared mission.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly will commence a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Prevail Therapeutics Inc. for a purchase price of $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $880 million) payable at closing plus one non-tradeable CVR. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders to up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable (subject to certain terms and conditions) upon the first regulatory approval for commercial sale of a Prevail product in one of the following countries: United States, Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. To achieve the full value of the CVR, such regulatory approval must occur by December 31, 2024. If such regulatory approval occurs after December 31, 2024, the value of the CVR will be reduced by approximately 8.3 cents per month until December 1, 2028 (at which point the CVR will expire). There can be no assurance any payments will be made with respect to the CVR. The transaction is not subject to any financing condition and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Prevail’s common stock. Following the successful closing of the tender offer, Lilly will acquire any shares of Prevail that are not tendered in the tender offer through a second-step merger at the same consideration as paid in the tender offer.

The purchase price payable at closing represents a premium of approximately 117 percent to the 60-day volume-weighted average trading price of Prevail’s common stock ended on December 14, 2020, the last trading day before the announcement of the transaction. Prevail’s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Prevail’s stockholders tender their shares in the tender offer. Additionally, certain Prevail stockholders, beneficially owning approximately 51 percent of Prevail’s outstanding common stock, have (subject to certain terms and conditions) agreed to tender their shares in the tender offer.

Upon closing, the impact of this transaction will be reflected in Lilly’s 2021 financial results according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). There will be no change required to Lilly’s 2021 financial guidance being issued today for research and development expense or non-GAAP earnings per share as a result of this transaction.

For Lilly, Lazard is acting as sole financial advisor and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is acting as legal counsel. For Prevail, Centerview Partners LLC is acting as sole financial advisor, Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal counsel, and Cooley LLP also provided legal counsel.

53611,Sedor's Sesquient Receives the US FDA's Approval for Status Epilepticus,Sedor Pharmaceuticals Receives FDA Approval for SESQUIENT™ (fosphenytoin sodium) for the Treatment of Status Epilepticus in Adult and Pediatric Patients,"The US FDA has approved Sesquient (fosphenytoin sodium for injection) for the treatment of status epilepticus in adult and pediatric patients
 Sedor is actively in discussions to license the rights to Sesquient for NA, EU, and other territories, except for the People’s Republic of China, where it has already been licensed
 Sesquient is the first and only FDA-approved room temperature stable fosphenytoin and can help HCPs to treat status epilepticus patients and reduce hospital costs associated with this condition","PAOLI, Pa.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Sedor Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Sedor) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved SESQUIENT (fosphenytoin sodium for injection) for the treatment of status epilepticus in adult and pediatric patients.

According to Neurocritical Care Society Guidelines, status epilepticus, which is classified as a single epileptic seizure lasting more than five minutes or two or more seizures within a five-minute period, must be treated quickly since irreversible brain damage or death may result if cessation of seizure is not achieved within 60 minutes of onset. Ready-to-dilute and room temperature stable, SESQUIENT is the only FDA-approved fosphenytoin that allows point-of-care storage, as well as fast and efficient administration in emergency rooms, intensive care units, first responder vehicles, and long-term care facilities, where serial seizures such as status epilepticus are most commonly treated.

“Status epilepticus is associated with irreversible neurologic damage and death, both of which largely depend on the seizure duration before initial treatment,” stated Barry Frankel, Chief Business Officer and co-founder of Sedor. “At some hospitals, it can take up to 30 minutes to get a status epilepticus drug from the pharmacy to the point of care in the ER to treat a patient. SESQUIENT – the first and only FDA-approved room temperature stable fosphenytoin – could help health care providers quickly treat status epilepticus patients and potentially reduce hospital costs associated with this condition.”

“This is an important milestone for Sedor Pharmaceuticals and opens a significant global market for the company. As our first FDA-approved drug, SESQUIENT validates our business model of efficient development of critical care hospital injectable products,” added John Sedor, Chairman, CEO and co-founder of Sedor. Mr. Sedor added, “While SESQUIENT is available in pre-filled liquid vials, this is a multi-dosage platform, which we believe will be followed by a pre-filled IV bag. With this achievement completed, we are turning our focus to the development of our second product, Meloxicam for injection solubilized with betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium, for the potential treatment of acute post-surgical pain.”

Sedor is actively engaged in discussions to license the rights to SESQUIENT for North America, Europe, and other territories, except for the People’s Republic of China, where it has already been successfully licensed. Concurrently, Sedor is in discussions on securing capital to retain North American rights and commercialize the product.

53621,Rhythm's Imcivree (setmelanotide) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Chronic Weight Management in Patients with Obesity,"Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Announces FDA Approval of IMCIVREE™ (setmelanotide) as First-ever Therapy for Chronic Weight Management in Patients with Obesity Due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR Deficiency","The US FDA has approved Imcivree for chronic weight management in adult & pediatric patients aged ≥6yrs. with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency confirmed via genetic testing
 The approval is based on results of P-III trials that demonstrated 80% of patients with obesity due to POMC or PCSK1 deficiency achieved >10% weight loss & 45.5% of patients with obesity due to LEPR deficiency achieved >10% weight loss after 1yr of treatment
 The US FDA issued a Rare Pediatric Disease PRV to Rhythm with the approval. The PRV can be redeemed to receive PR for any marketing application or sold/ transferred to other companies for their programs. The therapy is under EMA’s review for approval","BOSTON, Nov. 27, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:RYTM), a biopharmaceutical company aimed at developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of rare genetic diseases of obesity, announced today that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has approved IMCIVREE™ (setmelanotide) for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with obesity due to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency confirmed by genetic testing. With this approval, IMCIVREE becomes the first-ever FDA approved therapy for these rare genetic diseases of obesity.

“Our first new drug approval is a major milestone for Rhythm, and we look forward to delivering on the promise of IMCIVREE for patients suffering with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency,” said David Meeker, M.D., Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rhythm. “With IMCIVREE, we are advancing a first-in-class, precision medicine that is designed to directly address the underlying cause of obesities driven by genetic deficits in the melanocortin-4 (MC4) receptor pathway.”

Obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency are ultra-rare diseases caused by variants in POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR genes that impair the MC4 receptor pathway, which is a pathway in the hypothalamus that is responsible for regulating hunger, energy expenditure and consequently body weight. People living with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency struggle with extreme, insatiable hunger beginning at a young age, resulting in early-onset, severe obesity. As an MC4 receptor agonist, IMCIVREE is designed to restore impaired MC4 receptor pathway activity arising due to genetic deficits upstream of the MC4 receptor. There have been no FDA-approved therapies specifically indicated to manage weight in obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency prior to IMCIVREE. Rhythm expects to make IMCIVREE commercially available to patients 6 years of age and older with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2021.

“Many patients and families who live with these diseases face an often burdensome stigma associated with severe obesity. To manage this obesity and control disruptive food-seeking behavior, caregivers often lock cabinets and refrigerators and significantly limit social activities,” said Jennifer Miller, M.D., pediatric endocrinologist at University of Florida Health. “This FDA approval marks an important turning point, providing a much needed therapy and supporting the use of genetic testing to identify and properly diagnose patients with these rare genetic diseases of obesity.”

The FDA approval of IMCIVREE is based on results from the largest studies conducted to date in obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency. In Phase 3 clinical trials, 80 percent of patients with obesity due to POMC or PCSK1 deficiency achieved greater than ten percent weight loss and 45.5 percent of patients with obesity due to LEPR deficiency achieved greater than ten percent weight loss after one year of treatment with IMCIVREE.

Consistent with prior clinical study experience, IMCIVREE was generally well-tolerated in both trials. The most common adverse events were injection site reaction, skin hyperpigmentation, and nausea. Warnings and precautions include disturbance in sexual arousal, depression and suicidal ideation, skin pigmentation and darkening of pre-existing nevi. There may be a risk of serious adverse reactions due to benzyl alcohol preservative in neonates and low birth weight infants. IMCIVREE is not approved for use in neonates or infants.

“We know that not all obesity is the same, and genetic testing plays a key role in enabling physicians, patients and families to understand the underlying cause of certain severe obesities,” said Murray Stewart, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Rhythm. “In addition to POMC, PCSK1 and LEPR genes, we are continuing our efforts to identify further genes and populations to evaluate the potential for setmelanotide to address the insatiable hunger and early-onset severe obesity that characterize these diseases.”

With this approval, the FDA issued a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to Rhythm. The PRV can be redeemed to receive priority review for any subsequent marketing application or sold or transferred to other companies for their programs. The FDA previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to setmelanotide for the treatment of obesity associated with genetic defects upstream of the MC4 receptor pathway, as well as orphan drug designation for obesity due to POMC (including PCSK1) and LEPR deficiencies.

Rhythm’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for setmelanotide to treat people living with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA has previously granted PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation for setmelanotide for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with deficiency diseases of the MC4 receptor pathway. Additionally, the Company is currently evaluating setmelanotide for reduction in hunger and body weight in a pivotal Phase 3 trial in people living with Bardet-Biedl or Alström syndrome with topline data expected late in the fourth quarter of 2020 or early in the first quarter of 2021. Rhythm also continues to enroll patients in its Phase 2 Basket Study designed to rapidly facilitate proof-of-concept in new indications.

IMCIVREE™ (setmelanotide) Indication
IMCIVREE is indicated for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with obesity due to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency. The condition must be confirmed by genetic testing demonstrating variants in POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (VUS).

Limitations of Use

IMCIVREE is not indicated for the treatment of patients with the following conditions as IMCIVREE would not be expected to be effective:

Obesity due to suspected POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency with POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR variants classified as benign or likely benign;
Other types of obesity not related to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency, including obesity associated with other genetic syndromes and general (polygenic) obesity.
Important Safety Information

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Disturbance in Sexual Arousal: Sexual adverse reactions may occur in patients treated with IMCIVREE. Spontaneous penile erections in males and sexual adverse reactions in females occurred in clinical studies with IMCIVREE. Instruct patients who have an erection lasting longer than 4 hours to seek emergency medical attention.

Depression and Suicidal Ideation: Some drugs that target the central nervous system, such as IMCIVREE, may cause depression or suicidal ideation. Monitor patients for new onset or worsening of depression. Consider discontinuing IMCIVREE if patients experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

Skin Pigmentation and Darkening of Pre-Existing Nevi: IMCIVREE may cause generalized increased skin pigmentation and darkening of pre-existing nevi due to its pharmacologic effect.

53626,Gilead Amends Agreement with Galapagos for Development and Commercialization of Jyseleca (filgotinib),Gilead and Galapagos announce New Commercialization and Development Agreement for Jyseleca® (filgotinib),"Following the FDA Type A meeting, Gilead will not pursue the approval of Jyseleca for RA in the US. Galapagos will be solely responsible in EU for Jyseleca (200/100mg) in RA and UC + all future indications for which Gilead will receive royalties on EU sales initiating in 2024
 Galapagos to receive $194.6M, which will be split b/w $133.7M in 2021 & $60.8M in 2022 for the ongoing development and accelerated commercial buildout in the EU
 Additionally, Galapagos will assume responsibility for ongoing clinical trials evaluating filgotinib in RA. Gilead will retain commercial rights for filgotinib outside the EU, including in Japan where filgotinib has recently been approved and is co-marketed with Eisai","Foster City, Calif., and Mechelen, Belgium, December 15, 2020, 22.15 CET; regulated information – Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Galapagos NV (Euronext & Nasdaq: GLPG) today announced that the companies have agreed to amend their existing arrangement for the commercialization and development of Jyseleca (filgotinib). This announcement follows a Type A meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the points raised in the Complete Response Letter (CRL) related to the New Drug Application (NDA) for filgotinib in the treatment of RA.

Based on the feedback received from the FDA during the NDA review process and in the Type A meeting, Gilead will not pursue FDA approval of filgotinib for RA. While both Gilead and Galapagos continue to believe in the clinical profile of the 200 mg dose, Gilead has concluded that this dose is required to be competitive in RA in the United States and that the 200 mg dose is unlikely to achieve approval for RA in the U.S. without conducting substantial additional clinical studies.

Under the new arrangement between the companies, Galapagos will assume sole responsibility in Europe for filgotinib in RA, where 200 mg and 100 mg doses are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe RA, and in all future indications. Galapagos will receive payments from Gilead in connection with changes in responsibility for the commercialization and development of filgotinib in Europe and Gilead will receive royalties from European sales of filgotinib. This is an acceleration of the commercial strategy in place for products under the separate ten-year research and development collaboration between the companies, where Galapagos is also responsible for European commercialization.

Through a phased transition including the transfer of filgotinib’s marketing authorization to Galapagos, the majority of activities supporting filgotinib in Europe are expected to be assumed by Galapagos by the end of 2021. Under the new operating model, Gilead will retain commercial rights and remain marketing authorization holder for filgotinib outside of Europe, including in Japan where filgotinib has recently been approved, and is co-marketed with Eisai.

“While we believe that the clinical profile of Jyseleca could help many patients living with RA, we no longer see a viable path to U.S. approval in this indication,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. “In this new context, Gilead and Galapagos believe it makes sense for Galapagos to drive commercialization in Europe. We are confident that through our strategic alliance with Galapagos, we will deliver many important new therapies for inflammatory diseases in the future.”

“Jyseleca is already providing an important new treatment option, making a difference to the lives of patients living with RA, where it is available in Europe,” said Onno van de Stolpe, Chief Executive Officer of Galapagos. “While we are very disappointed by the outcome of the FDA meeting, we are excited that we can now accelerate the plan for Galapagos to lead on commercial activities in Europe in our ongoing collaboration with Gilead, and fully leverage the commercial organization Galapagos has built for the Jyseleca launch. This is an important new chapter in Galapagos’ ongoing journey to be a leading European biotech company in inflammation and fibrosis.”

Filgotinib Development

Under the terms of the amended agreement, Galapagos will assume operational responsibility for ongoing clinical trials evaluating filgotinib in RA. Gilead and Galapagos recently paused clinical trials of filgotinib in psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and non-infectious uveitis following receipt of the CRL and, without a viable path forward in the United States, the companies no longer believe it is feasible to continue the current global development program for filgotinib in these indications. As a result, these trials will be stopped over the coming months.

Week 26 data from the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies, including primary and key secondary endpoints, will be available by mid-2021 and the parties expect to submit the data to regulatory authorities shortly thereafter. In order to complete their review of filgotinib in RA or other future indications, the FDA has requested up to Week 52 follow-up data for patients who show >50% decrease in semen parameters by Week 26 and do not recover in the ongoing MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies.

Gilead and Galapagos will continue to investigate the potential for filgotinib to support patients living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Gilead will retain operational responsibility for the current trials in Crohn’s disease while Galapagos will assume operational responsibility for ongoing trials in UC. Filgotinib is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of UC and is expected to be submitted to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in the first half of 2021. Gilead and Galapagos expect to have further clarity on the potential U.S. filing of filgotinib in IBD, after consultation with FDA, including on the results of the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies as described above.

Financial Terms of the Agreement

Under the terms of the new arrangement, Galapagos will assume all development, manufacturing, commercialization and certain other rights for filgotinib in Europe. The transfer will be subject to applicable local legal, regulatory and consultation requirements. The parties intend to transfer most activities by December 31, 2021 and complete the transition by December 31, 2022. Beginning on January 1, 2021, Galapagos will bear the future development costs for certain studies, in lieu of the equal cost split contemplated by the previous agreement. These studies include the DARWIN3, FINCH4, FILOSOPHY, and Phase 4 studies and registries in RA, MANTA and MANTA-RAy, the PENGUIN1 and 2 and EQUATOR2 studies in PsA, the SEALION1 and 2 studies in AS, the HUMBOLDT study in uveitis in addition to other clinical and non-clinical expenses supporting these studies and support for any investigator sponsored trials in non-IBD conditions and non-clinical costs on all current trials. The existing 50/50 global development cost sharing arrangement will continue for the following studies: SELECTION and its long-term extension study (LTE) in UC, DIVERSITY and its LTE, DIVERGENCE 1 and 2 and their LTEs and support for Phase 4 studies and registries in Crohn’s disease, pediatric studies and their LTEs in RA, UC and Crohn’s disease, and support for investigator sponsored trials in IBD.

All commercial economics on filgotinib in Europe will transfer to Galapagos as of January 1, 2022, subject to payment of tiered royalties of 8 to 15 percent of net sales in Europe to Gilead, starting in 2024. In connection with the amendments to the existing arrangement for the commercialization and development of filgotinib, Gilead has agreed to irrevocably pay Galapagos €160 million, which will be split between a €110 million payment in 2021 and a €50 million payment in 2022 and is subject to certain adjustments for higher than budgeted development costs. In addition, Galapagos will no longer be eligible to receive any future milestone payments relating to filgotinib in Europe. Gilead expects to recognize the full amount of these payments in its R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Information on Related Party Transaction

The following information is provided by Galapagos pursuant to article 7:116, paragraph 4 of the Belgian Companies and Association Code in connection with the term sheet that has been entered into between Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV on 15 December 2020. For a summary of the main terms of the term sheet and the amended terms of the parties’ existing agreement for the commercialization and future development of filgotinib, see above in this press release. These terms and amendments will be reflected in new agreements that will be entered into by Gilead and Galapagos on the basis of the term sheet.

Gilead has two representatives on the supervisory board of Galapagos (Daniel O’Day and Linda Higgins). In addition, Gilead holds (indirectly, through one of its subsidiaries) more than 25% of the shares in Galapagos. Hence, Gilead is considered a “related party” of Galapagos in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. In view hereof, the supervisory board of Galapagos applied the procedure of article 7:116 of the Belgian Companies and Association Code in connection with the approval of term sheet with Gilead. The two representatives of Gilead on the supervisory board of Galapagos did not participate in the deliberation and voting by the supervisory board in relation to the term sheet.

Within the context of the aforementioned procedure, a committee of three independent members of the supervisory board of Galapagos (the Committee) issued an advice to the supervisory board in which the Committee assessed the term sheet. In its advice to the supervisory board, the Committee concluded the following: “The Committee believes that under the circumstances the proposed amendments to Filgotinib Agreements are in the interest of Galapagos and all of its shareholders, and fully aligned with the long-term strategy of Galapagos. The proposed amendments offer an important opportunity to accelerate the plan for Galapagos to lead on commercial activities in Europe for future compounds in its ongoing R&D collaboration with Gilead, and to bolster and further leverage the commercial organization Galapagos has built for the launch of filgotinib. The return of the rights and responsibilities for filgotinib to Galapagos also comes with a number of challenges and risks in terms execution and operation, but these are not unreasonable and can be managed going forward. The Committee therefore believes that the proposed amendments to the collaboration with Gilead, are in the interest of Galapagos, and in any event not manifestly abusive. In view hereof, the Committee issues a favorable and unqualified opinion to the supervisory board of Galapagos.” The supervisory board did not deviate from the Committee’s advice.

The assessment by the statutory auditor of Galapagos of the advice of the committee and the minutes of the supervisory board is as follows: “Based on our review, we have noted no material inconsistency between the accounting and financial information included in the minutes of the supervisory board and in the advice of the ad hoc committee of the independent members of the supervisory board compared to the information that we, as the Company’s statutory auditor, have within the framework of our mandate.”

53631,Athenex's Klisyri (tirbanibulin) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Actinic Keratosis on the Face or Scalp,Athenex Announces FDA Approval of Klisyri® (Tirbanibulin) for the Treatment of Actinic Keratosis on the Face or Scalp,"The approval is based on P-III studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Klisyri (tirbanibulin, ointment 1%, 10 mg/g) vs vehicle in 702 adult patients in the ratio of (1:1) with actinic keratosis of the face or scalp
 Both the studies achieved their 1EPs defined as 100% clearance of the AK lesions @57 days within the treatment areas, complete clearance (44% vs 5% and 54% vs 13%) respectively
 Klisyri is the first FDA approved product for Athenex and will be launched in partnership with Almirall in the US during Q1’21","BUFFALO, N.Y., Dec. 15, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Athenex, Inc., (NASDAQ: ATNX), a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapies for the treatment of cancer and related conditions, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Klisyri® (tirbanibulin) for the topical treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) on the face or scalp. Klisyri is the first FDA approved branded proprietary product for Athenex and will be launched in partnership with Almirall in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2021. Klisyri will be manufactured by Athenex, highlighting the vertically integrated capabilities of the company ranging from a preclinical lead to a developed product for market launch.

“The FDA approval of Klisyri is a significant milestone for Athenex. Klisyri is a home-grown product discovered and characterized by Athenex scientists and developed from pre-IND to NDA by the Athenex team. We are extremely proud of our team’s excellent execution,” said Dr. Johnson Lau, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Athenex. “Approval demonstrates our ability to execute upon the entirety of the drug development and registration process. We are excited to partner with Almirall to bring this first-in-class microtubule inhibitor to patients with actinic keratosis in the US.”

Dr. Rudolf Kwan, Chief Medical Officer of Athenex added, “The FDA approval of tirbanibulin ointment represents a first-in-class microtubule inhibitor for the treatment of actinic keratosis. We believe this small molecule platform has the potential beyond actinic keratosis and are leveraging the platform to develop therapies for other oncology indications.”

Mr. Peter Guenter, CEO of Almirall, stated, “We are delighted to partner with Athenex to market Klisyri in the U.S. and in Europe. This approval from the FDA represents a new option for Dermatologists and marks an important further step for Actinic Keratosis patients. What makes this new therapy particularly exciting is the 5-day course of treatment and its good tolerability. We look forward to the launch of Klisyri in the US in the first quarter of 2021.”

The FDA approved Klisyri based on the data from two pivotal, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase III studies (KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Klisyri (tirbanibulin) ointment 1% in 702 adults with actinic keratosis of the face or scalp. Tirbanibulin demonstrated complete clearance of actinic keratosis lesions at day 57 in treated face or scalp areas in a significantly higher number of patients compared to vehicle. The most common adverse events were application site pruritus and pain reported by 9% and 10% of treated patients, respectively.

Actinic keratosis is a pre-cancerous skin lesion and is the second most common diagnosis made by dermatologists in the United States. If left untreated, 10-15% of AK lesions will develop into skin cancers.

Athenex has partnered with Almirall (Almirall, S.A., BME: ALM) to market Klisyri for the treatment of actinic keratosis on the face or scalp in the US and EU (including Russia) markets. In addition to the partnership with Almirall, Athenex has partnered with PharmaEssentia (6446.TWO) for actinic keratosis in Taiwan and has partnered with Xiangxue Pharmaceuticals (SHE:300147) for actinic keratosis in China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

About Klisyri®
Klisyri® (tirbanibulin) is a microtubule inhibitor indicated for the topical treatment of actinic keratosis on the face or scalp. The two double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized, parallel group, multicenter, Phase III studies (KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004) evaluated the efficacy and safety of tirbanibulin ointment 1% (10 mg/g) in adults with actinic keratosis on the face or scalp.

The studies enrolled a total of 702 patients across 62 sites in the U.S. Tirbanibulin ointment 1% (10 mg/g) or vehicle (randomized 1:1) was self-administered to 25 cm2 of the face or scalp encompassing 4-8 typical AK lesions, once daily for 5 consecutive days.

Both Phase III studies, KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004, achieved their primary endpoint, which was defined as 100% clearance of the AK lesions at Day 57 within the face or scalp treatment areas, each study achieving statistical significance (p<0.0001) on this endpoint. In the KX01-AK-003 study, complete clearance was observed in 44% of the patients treated with tirbanibulin versus 5% for the vehicle treated groups. In the KX01-AK-004 study, complete clearance was observed in 54% of the patients treated with tirbanibulin and 13% for vehicle treated groups.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions
KLISYRI may cause eye irritation. Avoid transfer of the drug into the eyes and to the periocular area during and after application. Wash hands immediately after application. If accidental exposure occurs, instruct patient to flush eyes with water and seek medical care as soon as possible.

Local Skin Reactions
Local skin reactions, including severe reactions (erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation and erosion/ulceration) in the treated area can occur after topical application of KLISYRI. Avoid use until skin is healed from any previous drug, procedure, or surgical treatment. Occlusion after topical application of KLISYRI is more likely to result in irritation.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) were local skin reactions, application site pruritus, and application site pain.

About Actinic Keratosis
Actinic keratosis or solar keratosis is a chronic and precancerous skin disease that occurs primarily in areas that have been exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation for a long period of time. It is usually found on the face, ears, lips, bald scalp, forearms, the posterior part of the hands, and lower legs. It is not possible to predict which AK lesions will develop into squamous cell carcinoma, so all lesions should be treated by a dermatologist. Actinic keratosis is the second most common diagnosis made by dermatologists in the United States.

Osaka, JAPAN, December 15, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) and granted Priority Review for the investigational therapy budesonide oral suspension, TAK-721, which has been designed specifically for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).1 If approved, TAK-721 will be the first FDA-approved treatment for the chronic inflammatory disease, and Takeda plans to use the trade name Eohilia (budesonide oral suspension). The FDA grants Priority Review for medicines that, if approved, have the potential to offer significant advances in the safety or effectiveness of the current treatment approaches. TAK-721 previously received both Breakthrough Therapy designation and Orphan Drug designation from the FDA.

“For too long, healthcare professionals have been without approved treatments developed specifically to target the chronic, localized esophageal inflammation of EoE,” said Asit Parikh, MD, PhD, Head, Gastroenterology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “We are enthusiastic about the pivotal Phase 3 clinical data showing the ability of TAK-721 to help address esophageal inflammation. We’re committed to working closely with the FDA to further our collective understanding of EoE, and potentially bringing a new treatment option to patients and their healthcare professionals.”

EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that can cause damage to the esophagus.2 Impacting approximately one in 2,000 people in the U.S.,2,3,4,5,6 EoE is growing in prevalence.7 Though the exact cause is unknown, EoE involves a complex interplay of genetics, environmental factors and immune system dysfunction.8 The chronic inflammation of EoE can lead to a range of symptoms, which can vary by person and age,9 but most often results in difficulty swallowing.10 If left untreated, EoE can worsen over time and cause injury and inflammation to the esophagus.11 In severe cases, EoE can lead to narrowing of the esophagus, which may cause food to become stuck.10

 

“Because food is so integral to our social lives and well-being, many facets of everyday life are impacted by the symptoms of EoE,” said Karen Lasch, MD, Vice President, Gastroenterology, U.S. Medical, Takeda. “With no FDA-approved treatments, patients have limited choices and today’s news underscores the urgent needs of this patient population.”




 

The TAK-721 development program is the first and largest EoE Phase 3 clinical trial program in the U.S. to report results. The NDA filing is based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 trials ORBIT1 and ORBIT2, which investigated the safety and efficacy of TAK-721 in adolescent and adult patients (11 to 55 years of age) with EoE.12




 

About TAK-721 (budesonide oral suspension) 

TAK-721 (budesonide oral suspension) is a novel mucoadherent topically active oral viscous formulation of budesonide, formulated specifically as an investigational treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).1 The suspension is intended to treat the localized esophageal inflammation that is caused by EoE.

 

Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy designation and Orphan Drug designation do not guarantee approval or commercial availability.

 

About Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory disease localized in the esophagus.2 Although the exact cause of EoE is unknown, it is believed to be triggered by a variety of stimuli including certain foods and environmental allergens.8 The chronic inflammation of EoE can lead to a range of symptoms, which can vary by person and age, and include difficulty swallowing, vomiting and heartburn.9 If left untreated, inflammation of EoE can worsen and narrow the esophagus, which can lead to food impaction11 that may necessitate urgent endoscopic intervention.13 Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapeutic options for the treatment of EoE, though current management guidelines for EoE recommend the elimination of targeted food from patient diets, the use of proton pump inhibitors and/or treatment with topical glucocorticosteroids.14

It uses vibration technology that delivers mechanical stimulation to the hips & spine at a precise, individually calibrated frequency, encouraging the body to reduce bone resorption & potentially create new bone
 An initial study showed that just one 30min treatment with OsteoBoost reduced bone loss activity in all participants, showing a decrease of 14%, a reduction on par with bisphosphonate drugs
 The NIH funded a $2M to study for determining the positive effects of OsteoBoost in a larger study with a broader population. The larger study is currently enrolling patients & is scheduled to be completed in early 2022","San Francisco, CA, December 15, 2020 – Bone Health Technologies, creator of the OsteoBoost Vibration Belt that promises to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, has been granted “Breakthrough Device” designation by the US Food & Drug Administration. The FDA awards Breakthrough Device designation to products “that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions.”

OsteoBoost uses proprietary vibration technology that delivers gentle mechanical stimulation to the hips and spine at a precise, individually calibrated frequency, encouraging the body to reduce bone resorption and potentially create new bone. This localized vibration therapy’s effect is to stop the progression of bone loss and prevent the onset of osteoporosis. An initial study showed that just one 30-minute treatment with OsteoBoost reduced bone loss activity in all study participants, providing an average decrease of 14%, a reduction on par with bisphosphonate drugs. The initial study results were so promising that the National Institutes of Health funded a $2 million study to determine if the positive effects of OsteoBoost could be demonstrated in a longer study with a broader population. This larger, pivotal study is currently enrolling patients and is scheduled to be completed in early 2022.

1 in 2 women and 1 in 4 men over the age of 50 will suffer an osteoporosis-related fracture during their lifetime, costing the healthcare system over $19 Billion. With more than 1 million people per year experiencing a fracture due to low bone density, osteoporosis has become an epidemic in the United States.

Founded in 2018 by Shane Mangrum, MD, Dan Burnett, MD, and Michael Jaasma, Ph.D., Bone Health Technologies is focused on improving the lives of millions of people who are currently at risk of developing osteoporosis and subsequent bone fractures. “For years, I have wanted a better option for my patients with low bone density that doesn’t have the potential side effects and the inconvenience of current drug treatments. With OsteoBoost we’ve created a safe, drug-free alternative that is easy and convenient. Now my patients with osteopenia have a new way to improve their bone health and reduce their risk of fracture,” said Dr. Shane Mangrum.

Derived from NASA technology which proved that mechanical stimulation of bones through vibration would improve bone health in astronauts, OsteoBoost is the first product of its kind. Localized vibration delivered via a comfortable, easy-to-use belt has the potential to change the way osteopenia and osteoporosis are prevented and treated for millions of Americans.

 The test will be available on both the Abbott ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms. Abbott plans to submit its test for US FDA’s EUA imminently","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Dec. 15, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced today it received CE Mark for its new quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Immunoglobulin G) lab-based serology test. IgG antibody testing that gives a quantitative result (measuring the amount of antibodies) provides important insights to people as they recover from COVID-19 and helps evaluate a person’s immune response to a vaccine.

Countries around the world are preparing for the authorization and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. As these vaccines become available, healthcare professionals and researchers will need to assess how individuals and communities are responding.

“Testing will continue to help both identify those who are infected as well as determine whether people have had a natural or vaccine-induced immune response,” said John Hackett, Ph.D., divisional vice president of Applied Research and Technology for Abbott’s diagnostics business. “Quantitative antibody testing can help provide greater understanding of a person’s immune response.”

The evolution of serology testing during COVID-19

During the early months of the pandemic, Abbott launched its first COVID-19 IgG antibody blood test, which detects the nucleocapsid protein of the virus. The qualitative test continues to provide a better understanding of people’s immune response to the virus, including potential duration of the recovery process. The new quantitative antibody test expands on this knowledge by determining both the presence and level (or titer) of antibodies present in the blood.

Abbott’s scientists designed its quantitative assay to detect the spike protein of the virus, which plays an important part in how the virus enters the cells. As the body develops an immune response, antibodies develop and bind to the spike portion of the virus in order to block the protein and ultimately prevent infection.

Several vaccines are designed with the spike protein to trigger that same immune response. Research has also shown a correlation between rising IgG levels that target the spike protein, such as those in Abbott’s quantitative test, and rising levels of neutralizing antibodies, or the specific antibodies that block infections.1-2 Studies are underway to understand the relationship between the levels of antibodies a person has and potential immunity from the virus.

As we continue to learn more about the virus, antibody tests may help:

Determine and monitor a person’s immune response to vaccines, including research to determine how long a response may last
Assess whether a person’s antibody levels are a result of the body’s natural response to fighting the virus, versus a vaccine-induced response
Evaluate an individual’s level of antibodies to help determine eligibility and potency for convalescent plasma donations3
The quantitative IgG antibody test is the latest in Abbott’s broad portfolio of tests to support the global healthcare community in the fight against COVID-19. Abbott’s COVID-19 test portfolio includes molecular, antigen and serology tests. These tests can help healthcare professionals detect the virus at all stages of its life cycle, including tests that are done in the lab as well as rapid tests done at the point of care.

About the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant antibody test
Abbott’s quantitative IgG antibody test is designed to detect levels of IgG antibodies that attach to the virus’ spike protein on the virus surface in serum and plasma from individuals who are suspected to have had COVID-19, or in serum and plasma of subjects that may have been infected by SARS-CoV-2.

A study to determine the clinical performance of Abbott’s SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant test on its Alinity i instrument found it had 99.60% specificity (ability to exclude false positives) and 99.35% sensitivity (ability to exclude false negatives) in patients tested 15 days or more after symptoms began.

The quantitative IgG test will be available on both the Abbott ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms. Abbott is also developing a test and plans to submit for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization soon.

53665,Novartis's Entresto Receives the US FDA's Advisory Committee Recommendation to Treat Patients with HFpEF,Novartis announces positive FDA Advisory Committee recommendation for use of Entresto® to treat patients with HFpEF,"The US FDA’s CRDAC voted 12 to 1 supporting the use of Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) in the treatment of patients with HFpEF
 The decision was based on efficacy & safety analyses, including findings from a pre-specified subgroup analysis of PARAGON-HF (P-III study in HFpEF) and additional evidence from PARAMOUNT (P-II trial in HFpEF), as well as PARADIGM-HF (P-III trial in HFrEF)
 Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of CV death & heart failure hospitalization in people with long-lasting heart failure","EAST HANOVER, December 15, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) voted 12 to 1 that the data presented support the use of Entresto® (sacubitril/valsartan) in treatment of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This was based on data supporting the benefit of Entresto in reducing worsening heart failure (total heart failure [HF] hospitalizations and urgent HF visits) in patients studied in PARAGON-HF. If approved by the FDA, Entresto could become the first therapy indicated for use in treatment of patients with HFpEF, as well as the first medication approved for both major types of chronic heart failure, HFpEF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), both based on trials that included active comparators (valsartan and enalapril, respectively).1,2

With no approved therapies for HFpEF to address the prevention of HF hospitalizations and urgent visits, a significant unmet medical need exists for a treatment to reduce the burden associated with this debilitating condition. The FDA is expected to make a decision on the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) in the first quarter of 2021.

“Managing HFpEF has historically been a clinical and scientific challenge due to the heterogeneity of the condition,” said Scott Solomon, MD, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and PARAGON-HF Executive Committee Co-Chair. “Today’s vote represents much needed progress in this area of unmet need and is a positive step toward bringing a potential therapy to millions of patients suffering from this type of heart failure.”

The Committee’s positive decision is based on the totality of evidence from efficacy and safety analyses, including findings presented from a pre-specified subgroup analysis of PARAGON-HF, the largest and only Phase III active-controlled study to date in patients with HFpEF and additional evidence from PARAMOUNT (a Phase II trial in HFpEF), as well as PARADIGM-HF (a Phase III trial in HFrEF).5-7 Data from PARAGON-HF demonstrated a favorable safety profile for Entresto in patients with HFpEF, which is in line with the vast clinical and post-marketing experience in HFrEF, and showed clinical benefit of Entresto in HFpEF patients.2

“Our commitment to reimagine medicine through our extensive clinical trials program on heart failure has been unwavering, and we are encouraged by the Committee’s response today,” said David Soergel, MD, Global Head of Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Drug Development, Novartis. “We appreciate the valuable insights shared by the patient and advocacy community about this devastating disease, and we look forward to FDA’s decision on the potential approval of this new indication.”

HFpEF affects more than 3 million Americans, and is increasing in prevalence as the population ages.3,8 It is a complex disease for which it is difficult to develop treatments due to its heterogeneous pathophysiology and the varied impact of symptoms among patients, despite decades of research.9 HFpEF can change the structure of the heart and occurs when the muscle tissue of the heart thickens and stiffens so that it cannot expand to fill with enough blood to meet the body’s needs.10 HFpEF is associated with high rates of recurring heart failure hospitalizations, emergency room visits and urgent doctor’s office appointments.3,4 Each hospitalization event is associated with worsening long-term prognosis, and approximately one in four patients are re-admitted for heart failure within one year of discharge.11,12

Entresto is approved in 115 countries worldwide for the treatment of HFrEF, with more than 2.6 million patient-years of exposure to date.13

About our longstanding commitment to heart failure
To reimagine medicine for heart failure patients, Novartis established the largest global clinical program in the HF disease area across the pharma industry to date. Known as FortiHFy, it is comprised of more than 40 clinical studies designed to generate an array of additional data on efficacy, quality of life, patient-reported outcomes and real-world evidence with Entresto, as well as to extend understanding of heart failure. FortiHFy includes trials across HFpEF, including PARAGON-HF, PARAMOUNT and PARAGLIDE-HF, as well as Entresto’s current indication in HFrEF, such as PARADIGM-HF, PIONEER-HF, TRANSITION and PROVE-HF.

About Entresto for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization in people with long-lasting (chronic) heart failure (HFrEF).14 Entresto is usually used with other heart failure therapies in place of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or other angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy.14 Entresto is a twice-a-day prescription medicine that works by enhancing the beneficial neurohormonal systems (natriuretic peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).14,15 Most other heart failure medicines only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS. Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the ARB valsartan.14 Entresto film-coated tablets are available in three dosage strengths: 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg and 97/103 mg (sacubitril/valsartan).14 These doses are referred to as 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg in the clinical trial literature including The New England Journal of Medicine publication of the results of PARADIGM-HF.14 In adult patients, the target maintenance dose of Entresto is 97/103 mg twice daily as tolerated by the patient.14

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Entresto can harm or cause death to an unborn baby. Patients should talk to their doctor about other ways to treat heart failure if they plan to become pregnant. If a patient gets pregnant while taking Entresto, she should tell her doctor right away.

Patients are not to take Entresto if they are allergic to sacubitril or valsartan or any of the ingredients in Entresto; have had an allergic reaction including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or trouble breathing while taking a type of medicine called an ACE inhibitor or ARB; or take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto for at least 36 hours before or after they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients should talk with their doctor or pharmacist before taking Entresto if they are not sure if they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto if they have diabetes and take a medicine that contains aliskiren.

Before they take Entresto, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they have kidney or liver problems; or a history of hereditary angioedema; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant; are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Patients should either take Entresto or breastfeed. They should not do both.

Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. They should especially tell their doctor if they take potassium supplements or a salt substitute; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); lithium; or other medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems such as an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or aliskiren.

Entresto may cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions causing swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat (angioedema) that may cause trouble breathing and death. Patients are to get emergency medical help right away if they have symptoms of angioedema or trouble breathing. Patients are not to take Entresto again if they have had angioedema while taking Entresto. People who are black or who have had angioedema may have a higher risk of having angioedema if they take Entresto. Entresto may cause low blood pressure (hypotension). Patients are to call their doctor if they become dizzy or lightheaded, or they develop extreme fatigue. Entresto may cause kidney problems or an increased amount of potassium in the blood.

The most common side effects in adults were low blood pressure, high potassium, cough, dizziness, and kidney problems.

53673,Novo Nordisk to Initiate a P-lll Study of Semaglutide to Treat Alzheimer Disease,Novo Nordisk to enter phase 3 development in Alzheimer’s disease with oral semaglutide,"Novo Nordisk plans to initiate a pivotal P-llla program to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Semaglutide (oral, 14mg, qd) vs PBO in 3,700 patients with AD with the anticipated initiation in H1’21
 The decision follows the evaluation of GLP-1 data from preclinical models, real-world evidence studies, post-hoc analysis of data from large cardiovascular outcomes trials, as well as discussions with regulatory authorities
 Semaglutide (7 mg and 14 mg) is approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D in the US, EU and Japan","Bagsværd, Denmark, 16 December 2020 – Novo Nordisk today announced the decision to enter phase 3 development in Alzheimer’s disease with 14 mg oral semaglutide, a once-daily oral formulation of the long-acting GLP-1 analogue semaglutide. The decision follows evaluation of GLP-1 data from preclinical models, real-world evidence studies, post-hoc analysis of data from large cardiovascular outcomes trials, as well as discussions with regulatory authorities.

Novo Nordisk intends to initiate a pivotal phase 3a programme with approximately 3,700 people with early Alzheimer’s disease. The programme is planned for initiation in the first half of 2021 and will investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral semaglutide, compared to placebo. The expected main treatment period in the trials is around two years.

“As a company we aspire to address high unmet medical needs within serious chronic diseases, and we are therefore pleased to initiate phase 3 development of semaglutide within Alzheimer’s disease,” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief scientific officer at Novo Nordisk. “Alzheimer’s disease has been an area of extensive research in the past decades, unfortunately without any major medical breakthroughs. Due to the growing unmet medical need and the increasing evidence of a potential therapeutic role for GLP-1, we will investigate the benefits of oral semaglutide in early Alzheimer’s disease.”

Conference call
On 16 December at 4 pm CET, corresponding to 10 am EST, a conference call for investors will be held where members of management will elaborate on the decision and provide a brief update on the GLP-1 R&D strategy. Investors will be able to listen in via a link on the investor section of novonordisk.com.

About Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease represents a rapidly growing public health concern causing significant detrimental consequences to the affected people and their families and has led to substantial and increasing global socioeconomic impact. Worldwide, 70-100 million people are estimated to have early Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia stages). 

About data from preclinical models, real-world evidence studies and the post-hoc analysis
Animal studies highlight the key effects of GLP-1 relevant for Alzheimer’s disease including improved memory function and reduced phospho-tau accumulation. Semaglutide has specifically been shown to reduce measures of neuro-inflammation which may affect cognition and function.

Further, real-world evidence from two Danish nationwide registries, the US Truven claims database and the US FDA FAERS database support a potential association between lower risk of dementia following treatment with GLP-1.

Finally, in a post-hoc analysis of data from three large cardiovascular outcomes trials conducted by Novo Nordisk (LEADER, SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6), which included 15,820 patients with type 2 diabetes with median follow-up of 3.6 years, a total number of 47 people were identified with development of dementia, of which 32 were on placebo and 15 on GLP-1 (liraglutide or semaglutide). The rate of developing dementia was statistically significantly reduced by 53% in favour of GLP-1.

About oral semaglutide
Oral semaglutide (7 mg and 14 mg) is approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes in the US, EU and Japan. The approval of Rybelsus® is based on the results from 10 clinical trials which included 9,543 adults with type 2 diabetes. Rybelsus® demonstrated a safe and well-tolerated profile across the clinical trials, with the most common adverse event being mild to moderate nausea which diminished over time.

53681,Novartis's Zolgensma Receives Health Canada Approval as the One-Time Gene Therapy for Pediatric Patients with SMA,"Health Canada approves Zolgensma®, the one-time gene therapy for pediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)","The Health Canada has approved Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) for pediatric patients with 5q SMA with bi-allelic mutations in the SMN1 gene and 3 or fewer copies of SMN2 gene or infantile-onset SMA
 The efficacy and safety data supporting the approval of Zolgensma are derived from completed and ongoing studies in patients with SMA and 2 copies of SMN2 gene and presymptomatic genetically diagnosed SMA and 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 gene
 Zolgensma (IV) is a gene therapy designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by replacing the missing or defective SMN1 gene","DORVAL, QC, Dec. 16, 2020 /CNW/ – Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. is pleased to announce that Health Canada has approved Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-based gene therapy indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with bi-allelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene and 3 or fewer copies of SMN2 gene; or infantile-onset SMA1.

Zolgensma is a gene therapy designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by replacing the missing or defective SMN1 gene1. It is administered during an intravenous (IV) infusion, delivering a new working copy of the SMN1 gene into a patient’s cells, halting disease progression and restoring production of SMN protein1.

“SMA can be a devastating diagnosis for families to receive. Without treatment, many children would not be able to meet important developmental milestones like lifting their head, sitting or walking. Even breathing and swallowing can become difficult in the severe, infant-onset form of this disease,” said Dr. Hugh McMillan, Pediatric Neurologist at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa. “The approval of Zolgensma in Canada offers children an opportunity to maximize their developmental potential from this one-time therapy. The decision to treat based upon weight may allow children diagnosed slightly later to also benefit from this therapy.”

“When I first started diagnosing SMA, I couldn’t have imagined that we would see such scientific advancements,” said Dr. Nicolas Chrestian, Chief of Paediatric Neurology, specialized in neuromuscular disorders at Centre Hospitalier Mère Enfant Soleil, Université Laval in Québec City. “Zolgensma offers, in a single dose, the possibility of halting the progression of this degenerative condition that can rob children of regular developmental milestones.”

In Canada each year, approximately one in 10,000 babies are born with SMA, a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a defective or missing SMN1 gene3. Without a functional SMN1 gene, infants with SMA lose the motor neurons responsible for muscle functions such as breathing, swallowing, speaking and walking2. Left untreated, muscles become progressively weaker2,3. In the most severe form, this eventually leads to paralysis and ultimately permanent ventilation or death by age 2 in more than 90% of cases4.

“The SMA community is thrilled to have another treatment option to offer hope to families grappling with an SMA diagnosis. The approval of Zolgensma couldn’t come soon enough. We will continue to advocate until everyone who needs access to treatment can benefit from innovations like this,” said Susi Vander Wyk, Executive Director, CureSMA Canada.

“Today’s announcement about the Canadian approval of Zolgensma is a significant milestone in our journey to reimagine medicine by changing the treatment paradigm for children with SMA.” said Andrea Marazzi, Country Head, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada. “Our commitment to the SMA community truly comes to life when those that could benefit most from Zolgensma can access it. This is why we continue to work collaboratively with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance, provinces and territories to make this happen as quickly as possible.”

The efficacy and safety data supporting the approval of Zolgensma in treating pediatric patients with SMA are derived from completed and ongoing open-label, single-arm, clinical trials in patients with infantile-onset SMA and 2 copies of SMN2 gene; and presymptomatic genetically diagnosed SMA and 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 gene1.

Zolgensma is the only gene therapy approved by Health Canada for the treatment of SMA1. Thirteen treatment sites have been identified in leading healthcare institutions with SMA expertise. The sites are located in: Vancouver, BC; Edmonton, AB; Calgary, AB; Saskatoon, SK; Winnipeg, MB; London, ON; Hamilton, ON; Toronto, ON; Ottawa, ON; Montreal, QC; Quebec City, QC; Halifax, NS.

About Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
SMA is the leading cause of genetic infant death2. Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so SMA patients with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities5. This is why it is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression6. Early diagnosis is especially critical in the most severe form, where motor neuron degeneration starts before birth and escalates quickly5. Newborn screening for SMA is currently being implemented in Ontario and piloted in Alberta7,8.

53687,Amgen Reports NDA Submission of Sotorasib to the US FDA for Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC With KRAS G12C Mutation,Amgen Submits Sotorasib New Drug Application To U.S. FDA For Advanced Or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With KRAS G12C Mutation,"The NDA submission is based P-II CodeBreaK 100 study assessing Sotorasib in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC prior treated with CT and immunotherapy
 The study provided durable anticancer activity with a positive benefit-risk profile
 The US FDA has reviewed the NDA under RTOR pilot program, which aims to explore efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible","THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Dec. 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sotorasib, an investigational KRASG12C inhibitor for the treatment of patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, following at least one prior systemic therapy.

“Sotorasib was the first KRASG12C inhibitor to enter the clinic and now is on track to potentially be the first approved targeted therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring the KRAS G12C mutation. In the U.S., about 13% of patients with NSCLC have the KRAS G12C mutation and face a significant unmet need,” said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “This submission, along with these other important regulatory achievements, underscore Amgen’s commitment to bringing this potential treatment option to patients as quickly as possible.”

The NDA is being reviewed by the FDA under its Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, which aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible.1

The submission is supported by positive Phase 2 results in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC from the CodeBreaK 100 clinical study, whose cancer had progressed despite prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. In the study, treatment with sotorasib provided durable anticancer activity with a positive benefit-risk profile.2 These results will be presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2020 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) Presidential Symposium in January 2021.

About Sotorasib
Amgen has taken on one of the toughest challenges of the last 40 years in cancer research by developing sotorasib, an investigational KRASG12C inhibitor.3 Sotorasib was the first KRASG12C inhibitor to enter the clinic and is being studied in the broadest clinical program exploring 10 combinations with global sites spanning across four continents. In just over two years, the sotorasib clinical program has established the deepest clinical data set with more than 600 patients studied across 13 tumor types.

Sotorasib has demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile with fast, deep and durable anticancer activity in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring the KRAS G12C mutation with a once daily oral formulation. Promising responses have also been observed in multiple other solid tumors.

KRAS G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC.4,5 In the U.S., about 13% of patients with NSCLC harbor the KRAS G12C mutation.6 There is a high unmet need and poor outcomes in the second-line treatment of KRAS G12C-driven NSCLC and, currently, there are no KRASG12C targeted therapies approved.7

About CodeBreaK
The CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen’s investigational drug sotorasib is designed to treat patients with an advanced solid tumor with the KRAS G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers. As the most advanced KRAS G12C clinical development program, CodeBreaK has enrolled more than 600 patients across 13 tumor types since its inception.

CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with KRAS G12C-mutated solid tumors. Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The Phase 2 trial in NSCLC enrolled 126 patients, 123 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline. The Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer (CRC) is fully enrolled and topline results are expected in 2021.

A global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC (CodeBreaK 200) is currently recruiting. Amgen also has several Phase 1b combination studies across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment.

Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration or potential collaboration in pursuit of therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 (including statements regarding such collaboration’s, or our own, ability to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 or antibodies against targets other than the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, and/or to produce any such antibodies to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19), or the Otezla® (apremilast) acquisition (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

53700,Kite's Tecartus (KTE-X19) Receives EC's Conditional Marketing Authorization for R/R Mantle Cell Lymphoma,Kite’s Tecartus™ (KTE-X19) Granted Conditional Marketing Authorization for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma in Europe,"The approval is based on P-II ZUMA-2 study assessing Tecartus in 74 patients with r/r MCL prior treated with anthracycline/ bendamustine-containing CT, an anti-CD20 Ab therapy and a BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib)
 The study demonstrated an OR rate (93 %) with CR (67%), as assessed by an Independent RRC following a single infusion. In safety analyses, Grade 3 or higher CRS and neurologic events in 15% and 33% of patients
 Tecartus is the first CAR T therapy in r/r MCL. With the approval, Kite becomes the first company with multiple approved cell therapies in the EU","SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Kite, a Gilead Company (Nasdaq: GILD), today announced that the European Commission has granted conditional marketing authorization for Tecartus™ (autologous, anti-CD19-transduced CD3+ cells; formerly KTE-X19). Tecartus is a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy including a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. Conditional authorization is granted in the interest of public health where the benefit of immediate availability outweighs the risk of less comprehensive data available.

The conditional marketing authorization is supported from the multinational, single-arm, Phase 2 open-label ZUMA-2 pivotal trial in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who had previously received anthracycline- or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti-CD20 antibody therapy and a BTK inhibitor. ZUMA-2 demonstrated an overall response rate (complete or partial) of 93 percent, with 67 percent of patients achieving a complete response, as assessed by an Independent Radiologic Review Committee following a single infusion of Tecartus. In the safety analyses, Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events were observed in 15 percent and 33 percent of patients, respectively.

“Significant gaps in treatment remain for patients with mantle cell lymphoma who progress following initial therapies,” said Professor John G. Gribben, Consultant Haematologist and Medical Oncologist at Barts and The London NHS Trust, London. “The availability of this first cell therapy for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, following at least two lines of systemic therapy including a BTK inhibitor, provides an important option for patients in Europe.”

“Kite is committed to bringing the curative intent potential of CAR T-cell therapy to patients with hematological cancers,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Kite’s Global Head of Clinical Development. We are proud our second cell therapy has been approved for use in Europe, and I extend my thanks to the patients who participated in the clinical trial and their families and caregivers, clinical researchers, regulators and dedicated colleagues at Kite who helped make this approval possible for patients living with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.”

Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises from cells originating in the “mantle zone” of the lymph node and predominantly affects men over the age of 60. Patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy including a BTK inhibitor have a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival of 6 to 10 months. In Europe, it is estimated that at least 7,400 people are diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma each year.

Tecartus is a CAR T-cell therapy, an individualized method of treatment that harnesses the body’s own immune system to target cancer cells. The therapy uses the XLP™ manufacturing process that includes T cell enrichment, a necessary step in certain B cell malignancies in which circulating lymphoblasts are a common feature. In recognition of its potential to benefit patients with significant unmet medical need, Tecartus was granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation by the EMA.

Conditional marketing authorization in Europe is initially valid for one year but can be extended or converted into an unconditional marketing authorisation after the submission and assessment of additional confirmatory data. Conditional approval is granted to a medicinal product that fulfils an unmet medical need where the benefit of immediate availability outweighs the risk of less comprehensive data than normally required. It requires additional monitoring and post-marketing data before full approval is granted.

For full details on the Special Warnings and Precautions for Use and Adverse Reactions (including appropriate management), please refer to the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

About ZUMA-2

ZUMA-2 is an ongoing, multinational, single arm, Phase 2 open-label pivotal trial. The study enrolled 74 adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who had previously received anthracycline- or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti-CD20 antibody therapy and a BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib). The treatment was manufactured for 71 patients and administered to 68 patients. The primary endpoint was objective response rate per the Lugano Classification (2014), defined as the combined rate of complete response and partial responses as assessed by an Independent Radiologic Review Committee.

53744,Moderna's mRNA-1273 Receives the US FDA's Advisory Committee Vote Supporting EUA Against COVID-19,Moderna Receives FDA Advisory Committee Vote Supporting Emergency Use for Moderna’s Vaccine Against COVID-19 in the United States,"The VRBPAC voted 20-0, with one abstention that the benefits of the Moderna’s vaccine outweighed its risks for use in people aged ≥18yrs
 The recommendation is based on data analysis from the pivotal P-III clinical study that demonstrated 94.1% efficacy
 The US FDA’s committees provide non-binding recommendations. The FDA will take the VRBPAC’s recommendation into consideration in making a final decision on approval","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Dec. 17, 2020– Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq:MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today confirmed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) recommended that the FDA grant an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273. 20 VRBPAC members recommended for EUA, 0 members voted against, and 1 abstained.

“We were grateful for the opportunity to present the clinical data package for our mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 to the FDA’s advisory committee today. We thank the committee for their review and for their positive recommendation in support of Emergency Use Authorization,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “We have been working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Operation Warp Speed to prepare for the distribution of mRNA-1273, if the FDA chooses to grant an Emergency Use Authorization. We look forward to getting our vaccine to people in the U.S. to help address this ongoing public health emergency.”

The VRBPAC based its recommendation on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the Company, including a data analysis from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study announced on November 30. The primary efficacy analysis conducted on 196 cases indicated a vaccine efficacy rate of 94.1%. The most common solicited adverse reactions (ARs) after the two-dose series included injection site pain (88.2%), erythema (8.6%), swelling (12.2%), and ipsilateral lymphadenopathy (14.2%). While the majority of these ARs were grade 1 (mild) or grade 2 (moderate), there was a higher occurrence of grade 3 (severe) reactions in the mRNA-1273 group and after the second injection. The majority of local solicited ARs occurred within the first one to two days after injection and generally persisted for a median of one to two days. Safety data continue to accrue, and the study continues to be monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) appointed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All participants in the COVE study will be monitored for two years after their second dose to assess long-term protection and safety.

The Phase 3 study, known as the COVE study, enrolled more than 30,000 participants in the U.S. and is being conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

FDA advisory committees provide non-binding recommendations. The FDA will take the VRBPAC’s recommendation into consideration in making a final decision on approval or authorization. Under an EUA, the FDA has the authority to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions during a declared public health emergency when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.

Shipping and Temperature Update

Also presented at today’s VRBPAC meeting, Moderna has expanded the handling guidance for mRNA-1273 to include local transport under controlled conditions in a liquid state at 2-8°C (36° to 46°F). In some cases, this may be the only practical means of distribution from clinics and for remote locations. This important update will help facilitate distribution to the final site of administration. Recognizing that shipping and handling of product can be a barrier to vaccination, Moderna remains committed to supporting efficient distribution. Moderna previously announced that mRNA-1273 remains stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for 30 days.

53758,GSK's Benlysta (belimumab) Receives the US FDA's Approval as the First Therapy for Active Lupus Nephritis (LN),FDA approves GSK’s BENLYSTA as the first medicine for adult patients with active lupus nephritis in the US,"The approval follows BTD and PR & is based on P-lll BLISS-LN study involves assessing Benlysta (IV, 10 mg/kg) + SOC vs PBO + SOC in 448 adult patients with active LN
 The study met its 1EPs demonstrating a greater number of patients who achieved PERR @2yrs. (43% vs 32%., all 2EPs were achieved while safety results are consistent with the known safety profile of Benlysta
 Benlysta is a mAb that binds to soluble BLyS and does not bind B cells directly. The approval extends the current indication in the US to include both SLE and LN for both the IV and SC formulations","GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BENLYSTA (belimumab) for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis (LN) who are receiving standard therapy. Lupus nephritis is a serious inflammation of the kidneys caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most common form of lupus, which can lead to end-stage kidney disease, requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant. The approval extends the current indication in the US to include both SLE and LN for both the intravenous and subcutaneous formulations.

Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK said: “Approximately 40% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus develop lupus nephritis, which causes inflammation in the kidneys and can lead to end-stage kidney disease. BENLYSTA is the first medicine approved to treat systemic lupus and adults with active lupus nephritis, an important treatment advance for patients with this incurable autoimmune disease.”

The FDA approval for adult patients with active LN follows a Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review and is based on the positive results of the BLISS-LN (Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab in Adult Patients with Active Lupus Nephritis) study and the unmet need in this patient population. The BLISS-LN study is the largest and longest phase 3 study conducted in active LN, involving 448 adult patients. The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that a statistically significant greater number of patients achieved Primary Efficacy Renal Response (PERR) at two years (or 104 weeks) when treated with BENLYSTA plus standard therapy compared to placebo plus standard therapy in adults with active LN (43% vs 32%, odds ratio (95% CI) 1.55 (1.04, 2.32), p=0.0311). Statistical significance compared to placebo across all four major secondary endpoints was achieved, including Complete Renal Response and Time to Renal-Related Event or Death. The safety results are consistent with the known safety profile of BENLYSTA.

Dr. Richard Furie, Chief of the Division of Rheumatology and Professor at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health and Lead Investigator of the BLISS-LN study, commented: “We have long aspired to enhance outcomes for patients with lupus nephritis. In the four decades I have been caring for people with lupus, we have not been able to achieve remission in more than just one-third of patients with lupus nephritis and, despite all of our efforts, 10% to 30% of patients with lupus kidney disease still progress to end-stage kidney disease. The data from the BLISS-LN study show that BENLYSTA added to standard therapy not only increased response rates over two years, but it also prevented worsening of kidney disease in patients with active lupus nephritis compared to standard therapy alone. Therefore, it is gratifying to see the rewards of decades of research.”

Dr. Brad Rovin, Director of the Division of Nephrology and Medical Director of the Center for Clinical Research Management at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, commented, “The overarching goal in the management of patients with lupus nephritis is to delay the need for kidney replacement therapies, such as dialysis and transplantation. The BLISS-LN study not only demonstrated that the addition of BENLYSTA to standard therapy significantly increased the PERR, but also showed that patients had a 49% decrease in risk for experiencing a renal-related event. I’m encouraged by the progress we’re making in lupus nephritis.”

About the BLISS-LN study
BLISS-LN is a phase 3, 104-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, post-approval commitment study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy (mycophenolate mofetil for induction and maintenance, or cyclophosphamide for induction followed by azathioprine for maintenance, plus steroids) compared to placebo plus standard therapy in adult patients with active LN. Active LN was confirmed by renal biopsy during screening visit using the 2003 International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society criteria within the past 6 months, and clinically active kidney disease requiring induction therapy.

About lupus nephritis (LN)
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most common form of lupus, is a chronic, incurable, autoimmune disease associated with a range of symptoms that can fluctuate over time including painful or swollen joints, extreme fatigue, unexplained fever, skin rashes and organ damage. In lupus nephritis (LN), SLE causes kidney inflammation (swelling or scarring) of the small blood vessels that filter wastes in your kidney (glomeruli) and sometimes the kidneys, by attacking them like they would attack a disease[1]. LN can lead to end-stage kidney disease, which requires kidney dialysis or a transplant. Despite improvements in both diagnosis and treatment over the last few decades, LN remains an indicator of poor prognosis.[2],[3] Manifestations of LN include proteinuria, elevations in serum creatinine and the presence of urinary sediment.

About BENLYSTA (belimumab)
BENLYSTA, a BLyS-specific inhibitor, is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble BLyS. BENLYSTA does not bind B cells directly. By binding BLyS, BENLYSTA inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells. First approved in 2011, it is the first and only approved biologic for both SLE and LN in more than 50 years.

The following information is based on the US Prescribing Information for BENLYSTA in licensed indications only. Please consult the full Prescribing Information for all the labelled safety information for BENLYSTA.

INDICATION

BENLYSTA is indicated for patients aged ≥5 years with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are receiving standard therapy and patients aged ≥18 with active lupus nephritis who are receiving standard therapy. The subcutaneous (SC) formulation is approved for patients aged ≥18 years. BENLYSTA is not recommended in patients with severe active central nervous system lupus or in combination with other biologics.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

CONTRAINDICATION
Previous anaphylaxis with BENLYSTA.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Serious Infections: Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents, including BENLYSTA. The incidence of serious infections was similar in patients receiving BENLYSTA versus placebo, whereas fatal infections occurred more frequently with BENLYSTA. The most frequent serious infections in adults with SLE treated with BENLYSTA IV included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, and bronchitis. Use caution in patients with severe or chronic infections and consider interrupting therapy in patients with a new infection.

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): Cases of JC virus-associated PML resulting in neurological deficits, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients with SLE receiving immunosuppressants, including BENLYSTA. If PML is confirmed, consider stopping immunosuppressant therapy, including BENLYSTA.

Hypersensitivity Reactions (Including Anaphylaxis): Acute hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (eg, hypotension, angioedema, urticaria or other rash, pruritus, and dyspnea) and death, have been reported, including in patients who have previously tolerated BENLYSTA. Generally, reactions occurred within hours of the infusion but may occur later. Non-acute hypersensitivity reactions (eg, rash, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and facial edema) typically occurred up to a week after infusion. Patients with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant hypersensitivity may be at increased risk. With BENLYSTA SC, systemic hypersensitivity reactions were similar to those in IV trials.

Healthcare providers (HCPs) should monitor patients during and after IV administration and be prepared to manage anaphylaxis; discontinue immediately in the event of a serious reaction. Premedication may mitigate or mask a hypersensitivity response. Advise patients about hypersensitivity symptoms and instruct them to seek immediate medical care if a reaction occurs.

Infusion Reactions: Serious infusion reactions (eg, bradycardia, myalgia, headache, rash, urticaria, and hypotension) were reported in adults. HCPs should monitor patients and manage reactions if they occur. Premedication may mitigate or mask a reaction. If an infusion reaction develops, slow or interrupt the infusion.

Depression and Suicidality:. In adult trials, psychiatric events were reported more frequently with BENLYSTA IV related primarily to depression-related events, insomnia, and anxiety; serious psychiatric events included serious depression and suicidality, including 2 completed suicides. No serious depression-related events or suicides were reported in the BENLYSTA SC trial. Before adding BENLYSTA, assess patients’ risk of depression and suicide and monitor them during treatment. Instruct patients/caregivers to contact their HCP if they experience new/worsening depression, suicidal thoughts, or other mood changes.

Malignancy: The impact of BENLYSTA on the development of malignancies is unknown; its mechanism of action could increase the risk for malignancies.

Immunization: Live vaccines should not be given for 30 days before or concurrently with BENLYSTA as clinical safety has not been established.

Use With Biologic Therapies: BENLYSTA has not been studied and is not recommended in combination with other biologic therapies, including B-cell targeted therapies.

ADVERSE REACTIONS:
The most common serious adverse reactions in adult SLE clinical trials were serious infections, BENLYSTA IV 6.0% (placebo 5.2%), some of which were fatal infections BENLYSTA IV 0.3% (placebo 0.1%). Adverse reactions occurring in ≥3% of adults and ≥1% more than placebo: nausea 15% (12%); diarrhea 12% (9%); pyrexia 10% (8%); nasopharyngitis 9% (7%); bronchitis 9% (5%); insomnia 7% (5%); pain in extremity 6% (4%); depression 5% (4%); migraine 5% (4%); pharyngitis 5% (3%); cystitis 4% (3%); leukopenia 4% (2%); viral gastroenteritis 3% (1%).

In adult patients with active lupus nephritis, serious infections occurred in 14% of patients receiving BENLYSTA IV (placebo 17%), some of which were fatal infections, BENLYSTA 0.9% (placebo 0.9%). Adverse reactions occurring in ≥3% of adults and ≥1% more than placebo were consistent with the known safety profile of BENLYSTA IV in SLE patients.

Adverse reactions in pediatric patients aged ≥5 years receiving BENLYSTA IV were consistent with those observed in adults.

The safety profile observed for BENLYSTA SC in adults was consistent with the known safety profile of BENLYSTA IV with the exception of local injection site reactions.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Pregnancy: There are insufficient data in pregnant women to establish whether there is drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. After a risk/benefit assessment, if prevention is warranted, women of childbearing potential should use contraception during treatment and for ≥4 months after the final treatment.

Pregnancy Registry: HCPs are encouraged to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to enroll themselves by calling 1-877-681-6296.

Lactation: No information is available on the presence of belimumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Consider developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding with the mother’s clinical need for BENLYSTA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child or from the underlying maternal condition.

Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness have not been established for BENLYSTA IV in SLE patients <5 years of age, and in active LN patients <18 years of age, and for BENLYSTA SC in SLE and LN patients <18 years of age.

About Biosimilars
A biosimilar biologic medicine, or biosimilar, is a biologic medicine that has demonstrated it is highly similar and has no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety compared to an original-brand (“reference”) biologic2 already authorized for sale. Biosimilars may become commercially available following the expiry of patents and data protection periods of the reference biologic medicine.

Since 2009, Health Canada has approved 32 biosimilars of original-brand biologics present on the Canadian market3.

Biosimilars have the potential to improve access to effective treatments while reducing the current economic burden on the Canadian healthcare system, patients, physicians and taxpayers as a whole. The Patented Medicines Pricing Review Board has estimated that private and public drug plans across Canada could save from $332 million CDN to $1.81 billion CDN in the third year following biosimilar entry across a portfolio of product4. The broader use of biosimilar medicines, including the implementation of biosimilar switching policies, can also help public and private drug plans improve their sustainability by adding new medicine listings and expanding existing medication coverage for patients. To that effect, the Ontario Drug Policy Research Network (ODPRN) recently released study report5 demonstrates that mandatory non-medical switching policies introduced in all provinces in 2019 (etanercept and infliximab only) could generate $239.6 million in national savings.

53771,"Amgen's Riabni (biosimilar, rituximab) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Multiple Diseases","FDA Approves Amgen’s RIABNI™ (rituximab-arrx), A Biosimilar To Rituxan® (rituximab)","The approval is based on trial assessing Riabni (375 mg/m2, IV) vs Rituxan once weekly for 4wks. followed by dosing @12wks. & 20wks. in 256 patients in a ratio (1:1) with grade 1, 2, or 3a follicular B-cell NHL & low tumor burden
 The WAC of Riabni will be 23.7% lower than the Rituxan in the US and will be available at a WAC of $716.80/ 100mg and $3,584.00/ 500mg single-dose vial
 Riabni is a biosimilar to Rituxan, approved for the treatment of NHL, CLL, GPA, MPA and ill be made available in the US in Jan 2021","THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Dec. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved RIABNI™ (rituximab-arrx), a biosimilar to Rituxan® (rituximab), for the treatment of adult patients with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis), and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA). RIABNI will be made available in the U.S. in January 2021.

“The approval of RIABNI represents an important milestone across our biosimilar and oncology portfolios,” said Murdo Gordon, executive vice president of Global Commercial Operations at Amgen. “Following the proven success of KANJINTI® (trastuzumab-anns) and MVASI® (bevacizumab-awwb) in the U.S. marketplace, RIABNI reaffirms Amgen’s long-term commitment to providing high quality biosimilars that can potentially offer more affordable, effective treatment options for cancer and other serious diseases and that contribute to the sustainability of healthcare systems.”

RIABNI, a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody, was proven to be highly similar to Rituxan based on a totality of evidence, which included comparative analytical, nonclinical and clinical data, with no clinically meaningful differences in safety or effectiveness. The data package was composed of, in part, results from a pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity study and a comparative clinical study.

The randomized, double-blind, comparative clinical study evaluated the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of RIABNI compared to Rituxan in subjects with grade 1, 2, or 3a follicular B-cell NHL and low tumor burden. There were 256 patients enrolled and randomized (1:1) to receive 375 mg/m2 intravenous infusion of either RIABNI or Rituxan, once weekly for 4 weeks followed by dosing at weeks 12 and 20. The primary endpoint, an assessment of overall response rate (ORR) by week 28, was within the prespecified margin for RIABNI compared to Rituxan, showing clinical equivalence. PK, PD, safety and immunogenicity of RIABNI were similar to Rituxan.

The Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC or “list price”) of RIABNI in the U.S. will be 23.7% lower than the reference product, Rituxan. RIABNI is being made available at a WAC of $716.80 per 100 mg and $3,584.00 per 500 mg single-dose vial, 23.7% less than the WAC for Rituxan, 15.2% less than the WAC for Truxima® (biosimilar to Rituxan) and matching the WAC for Ruxience® (biosimilar to Rituxan). At launch, RIABNI will be priced 16.7% below the current Rituxan Average Selling Price (ASP). RIABNI will be available from both wholesalers and specialty distributors.

Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its portfolio, five of which have been approved in the U.S., and three that are approved in the European Union (EU).

Important Safety Information

BOXED WARNINGS: FATAL INFUSION-RELATED REACTIONS, SEVERE MUCOCUTANEOUS REACTIONS, HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION, PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY

Infusion-Related Reactions: Rituximab product administration can result in serious, including fatal, infusion-related reactions. Deaths within 24 hours of rituximab infusion have occurred. Approximately 80% of fatal infusion-related reactions occurred in association with the first infusion. Monitor patients closely. Discontinue RIABNITM infusion for severe reactions and provide medical treatment for Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions.
Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: Severe, including fatal, mucocutaneous reactions can occur in patients receiving rituximab products. Discontinue RIABNITM in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction. The safety of readministration of RIABNITM to patients with severe mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined.
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: HBV reactivation can occur in patients treated with rituximab products, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Screen all patients for HBV infection before treatment initiation, and monitor patients during and after treatment with RIABNITM. Discontinue RIABNITM and concomitant medications in the event of HBV reactivation.
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal PML, can occur in patients receiving rituximab products. Discontinue RIABNITM and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML.
Infusion-Related reactions (IRR)

Rituximab products can cause severe, including fatal, infusion-related reactions. Severe reactions typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset of 30-120 minutes.
Rituximab-product-induced infusion-related reactions and sequelae include urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, anaphylactoid events, or death.
Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to dosing. For patients with Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA), methylprednisolone 100 mg intravenously or its equivalent is recommended 30 minutes prior to each infusion. Institute medical management (e.g., glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, or oxygen) for infusion-related reactions as needed. Depending on the severity of the infusion-related reaction and the required interventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue RIABNITM. Resume infusion at a minimum 50% reduction in rate after symptoms have resolved.
Closely monitor the following patients: those with preexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions, those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions, and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (≥25,000/mm3).
Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions

Mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, can occur in patients treated with rituximab products. These reactions include paraneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
The onset of these reactions has been variable and includes reports with onset on the first day of rituximab exposure. Discontinue RIABNITM in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction. The safety of re-administration of rituximab products to patients with severe mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined.
Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs classified as CD20-directed cytolytic antibodies, including rituximab products. Cases have been reported in patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and also in patients who are HBsAg negative but are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive. Reactivation also has occurred in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive, and hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] positive).
HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e., increase in transaminase levels. In severe cases, increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur.
Screen all patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating treatment with RIABNITM. For patients who show evidence of prior hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive), consult with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy before and/or during RIABNITM treatment.
Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months following RIABNITM therapy. HBV reactivation has been reported up to 24 months following completion of rituximab therapy.
In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on RIABNITM, immediately discontinue RIABNITM and any concomitant chemotherapy, and institute appropriate treatment. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming rituximab product treatment in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Resumption of RIABNITM treatment in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing HBV.
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)

JC virus infection resulting in multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death can occur in rituximab-product -treated patients with hematologic malignancies or with autoimmune diseases. The majority of patients with hematologic malignancies diagnosed with PML received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The patients with autoimmune diseases had prior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of their last infusion of rituximab.
Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset neurologic manifestations. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Discontinue RIABNITM and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or hyperphosphatemia from tumor lysis, some fatal, can occur within 12−24 hours after the first infusion of RIABNITM in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). A high number of circulating malignant cells (≥25,000/mm3), or high tumor burden, confers a greater risk of TLS.
Administer aggressive intravenous hydration and anti-hyperuricemic therapy in patients at high risk for TLS. Correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as indicated.
Infections

Serious, including fatal, bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and following the completion of rituximab product-based therapy. Infections have been reported in some patients with prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia (defined as hypogammaglobulinemia >11 months after rituximab exposure).
New or reactivated viral infections included cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis B and C. Discontinue RIABNITM for serious infections and institute appropriate anti-infective therapy.
RIABNITM is not recommended for use in patients with severe, active infections.
Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions

Cardiac adverse reactions, including ventricular fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock may occur in patients receiving rituximab products. Discontinue infusions for serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Perform cardiac monitoring during and after all infusions of RIABNITM for patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias, or who have a history of arrhythmia or angina.
Renal Toxicity

Severe, including fatal, renal toxicity can occur after rituximab product administration in patients with NHL. Renal toxicity has occurred in patients who experience TLS and in patients with NHL administered concomitant cisplatin therapy during clinical trials. The combination of cisplatin and RIABNITM is not an approved treatment regimen. Monitor closely for signs of renal failure and discontinue RIABNITM in patients with a rising serum creatinine or oliguria.
Bowel Obstruction and Perforation

Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some cases leading to death, can occur in patients receiving rituximab products in combination with chemotherapy. In postmarketing reports, the mean time to documented gastrointestinal perforation was 6 (range 1−77) days in patients with NHL. Evaluate if symptoms of obstruction such as abdominal pain or repeated vomiting occur.
Immunization

The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab product therapy has not been studied, and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment.
For patients treated with RIABNITM, physicians should review the patient’s vaccination status and patients should, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating RIABNITM; administer non-live vaccines at least 4 weeks prior to a course of RIABNITM.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on human data, rituximab products can cause fetal harm due to B-cell lymphocytopenia in infants exposed in utero. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception with RIABNITM and for at least 12 months after the last dose.
Concomitant Use with Other Biologic Agents and Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) in GPA and MPA

Limited data are available on the safety of the use of biologic agents or DMARDs. Observe patients closely for signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used concomitantly. Use of concomitant immunosuppressants other than corticosteroids has not been studied in GPA or MPA patients exhibiting peripheral B-cell depletion following treatment with rituximab products.
Adverse Reactions

The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in clinical trials of NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were infusion-related reactions, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and infections. Additionally, lymphopenia and lung disorder were seen in NHL trials; and febrile neutropenia, pancytopenia, hypotension, and hepatitis B were seen in CLL trials.
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥25%) in clinical trials of NHL and CLL were infusion-related reactions. Additionally, fever, lymphopenia, chills, infection, and asthenia were seen in NHL trials; and neutropenia was seen in CLL trials.
Nursing Mothers

There are no data on the presence of rituximab products in human milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Because of the potential of serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with RIABNITM and for at least 6 months after the last dose.
Clinical Trials Experience in GPA and MPA

Adverse reactions reported in ≥15% of rituximab-treated patients were infections, nausea, diarrhea, headache, muscle spasms, anemia, and peripheral edema (other important adverse reactions include infusion-related reactions).
Induction Treatment of Patients with Active GPA/MPA (GPA/MPA Study 1)
Infusion-Related Reactions

In GPA/MPA Study 1, 12% vs 11% (rituximab-treated vs cyclophosphamide-treated, respectively) of patients experienced at least one infusion-related reaction. Infusion-related reactions included cytokine release syndrome, flushing, throat irritation, and tremor. In the rituximab group, the proportion of patients experiencing an infusion reaction was 12%, 5%, 4%, and 1% following the first, second, third, and fourth infusions, respectively. Patients were premedicated with antihistamine and acetaminophen before each rituximab infusion and were on background oral corticosteroids, which may have mitigated or masked an infusion-related reaction; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication diminishes the frequency or severity of infusion-related reactions.
Infections

In GPA/MPA Study 1, 62% vs 47% (rituximab-treated vs cyclophosphamide-treated, respectively) of patients experienced an infection by Month 6. The most common infections in the rituximab group were upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and herpes zoster. The incidence of serious infections was 11% vs 10% (rituximab-treated vs cyclophosphamide-treated, respectively), with rates of approximately 25 and 28 per 100 patient-years, respectively. The most common serious infection was pneumonia.
Hypogammaglobulinemia

Hypogammaglobulinemia (IgA, IgG, or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in patients with GPA and MPA treated with rituximab in GPA/MPA Study 1. At 6 months, in the rituximab group, 27%, 58%, and 51% of patients with normal immunoglobulin levels at baseline had low IgA, IgG, and IgM levels, respectively, compared to 25%, 50%, and 46% in the cyclophosphamide group.
Immunogenicity

A total of 23/99 (23%) rituximab-treated adult patients with GPA or MPA tested positive for anti-rituximab antibodies by 18 months in GPA/MPA Study 1. The clinical relevance of anti-rituximab antibody formation in rituximab-treated adult patients is unclear.
Treatment of Patients with GPA/MPA Who Have Achieved Disease Control with Induction Treatment (GPA/MPA Study 2)

In GPA/MPA Study 2, the safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of rituximab in immunologic indications.
Infusion-Related Reactions (IRR)

In GPA/MPA Study 2, 7/57 (12%) patients in the non-US-licensed approved rituximab arm reported infusion-related reactions. The incidence of IRR symptoms was highest during or after the first infusion (9%) and decreased with subsequent infusions (<4%). One patient had two serious IRRs; two IRRs led to a dose modification; and no IRRs were severe, fatal, or led to withdrawal from the study.
Infections

In GPA/MPA Study 2, 30/57 (53%) patients in the non-US-licensed approved rituximab arm and 33/58 (57%) in the azathioprine arm reported infections. The incidence of all-grade infections was similar between the arms. The incidence of serious infections was similar in both arms (12%). The most commonly reported serious infection in the group was mild or moderate bronchitis.

Amgen Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration or potential collaboration in pursuit of therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 (including statements regarding such collaboration’s, or Amgen’s, ability to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 or antibodies against targets other than the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, and/or to produce any such antibodies to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19), or the Otezla® (apremilast) acquisition (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Amgen’s business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.

Amgen’s results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen’s products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen’s research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen’s business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen’s business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for Amgen’s manufacturing activities, the distribution of Amgen’s products, the commercialization of Amgen’s product candidates, and Amgen’s clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on Amgen’s product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen’s products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen’s distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen’s products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen’s efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology Amgen has acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen’s systems and Amgen’s data. Amgen’s stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen’s business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.

53799,Merck Signs a ~$1B Pact with Janux to Develop Cancer Therapies Using T Cell Engager Technology,Janux Therapeutics Announces Collaboration with Merck to Develop Novel Drug Candidates for Immuno-Oncology using T Cell Engager (TRACTr) Technology,"Janux to receive up to $500.5M/ target as upfront and milestones along with royalties on sales of product emerges from the collaboration, making a total deal value ~$1B. Merck will fund R&D performed under the agreement
 Merck to get an exclusive WW license to products & IP developed from the collaboration
 The focus of the collaboration is to leverage Janux’s TRACTr technology to engineer a novel, T cell engager candidates directed against two cancer targets selected by Merck","SAN DIEGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Janux Therapeutics, today announced a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, to discover, develop and commercialize innovative, next generation T cell engager immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. The goal of the collaboration is to use Janux’s proprietary Tumor Activated T Cell Engager (TRACTrTM) technology to engineer novel, T cell engager drug candidates directed against two cancer targets selected by Merck. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck has received an exclusive worldwide license to products and intellectual property developed from this collaboration. In exchange, Janux will be eligible to earn up to $500.5 million per target in upfront and milestone payments plus royalties on sales of any product derived from the collaboration. Merck will fund research and development performed under the collaboration.

T cell engagers are an emerging class of immunotherapies that bind to a tumor cell and recruit a patient’s T cells to eradicate tumor cells, but previous technologies have been constrained by dose-limiting toxicities, poor pharmacokinetic profiles, and attenuated efficacy. Janux’s proprietary TRACTr technology is designed to overcome these limitations by integrating tumor-specific activation with crossover pharmacokinetics to produce best-in-class T cell engager therapeutics. In preclinical studies, Janux TRACTr drug candidates have demonstrated comparable anti-tumor efficacy relative to standard T cell engagers but lack the associated liabilities related to cytokine release, healthy tissue toxicities, or systemic immune activation.

“At Janux, we have developed a technology to engineer best-in-class T cell engagers that are potent and highly tumor specific, which is essential for an immune response that kills tumor cells but spares healthy tissue,” said David Campbell, Ph.D., President and CEO of Janux Therapeutics. “Partnering with Merck, a world leader in immuno-oncology, provides us with important expertise and resources in developing next generation T cell engager therapies that will make immunotherapy work for more cancer patients.”

About Janux Therapeutics

Janux Therapeutics is developing safe, effective novel immunotherapies with the company’s proprietary TRACTr technology. Janux’s TRACTr technology employs a modular design to rapidly engineer drug candidates against specific targets. The Janux TRACTr development pipeline targets multiple solid tumor indications, including colorectal, gastroesophageal, prostrate, NSCLC, triple negative breast, and ovarian cancers. Janux technology can be applied to immunotherapies that target all three stages of an anti-tumor immune response. Combining Janux’s tumor-specific activation with multi-stage anti-tumor signaling has the potential to significantly improve safety, expand the therapeutic dosing window, and maximize patient responses. Janux was founded in the Avalon Ventures accelerator, COI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in San Diego.

53812,ViiV Healthcare's First Long-Acting Injectable Receive EC's Approval for the Treatment of HIV,ViiV Healthcare announces the Marketing Authorisation of the first complete long-acting injectable HIV treatment in Europe,"The approval is based on P-III ATLAS, FLAIR and ATLAS-2M studies assessing Vocabria (cabotegravir injection and tablets) + Janssen’s Rekambys (rilpivirine inj.) or Edurant (rilpivirine tablets) in 1200+ patients for HIV-1 infection in adults who are virologically suppressed
 The first long-acting injectable can enable people living with HIV to reduce the days they receive treatment from 365 to 12 or 6/year. Most of the clinical trial patients who tried the treatment over their previous daily oral therapy preferred the new treatment
 The approval marks the second approval of the long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine, with once-monthly dosing licensed by Health Canada under the brand name Cabenuva","LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”), with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, announced the authorisation of Vocabria (cabotegravir injection and tablets) in combination with Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson’s Rekambys (rilpivirine injection) and Edurant (rilpivirine tablets), in the European Union, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who are virologically suppressed.1 Cabotegravir injection is indicated, in combination with rilpivirine injection, for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class. This authorisation represents the first time people living with HIV in Europe may be able to receive a long-acting injectable treatment that removes the need to take daily oral tablets, following the oral initiation phase.

Dr Antonio Antela, University Hospital, Santiago de Compostela, Spain, said: “Daily antiretrovirals have transformed the lives of people living with HIV. However, taking daily medication can pose challenges for some people; it may act as a constant reminder of HIV or be a cause of fear that their HIV status will be disclosed. Following the oral initiation phase to assess the tolerability of the medicines, cabotegravir and rilpivirine injections could reduce the number of days of treatment per year from 365 down to 12 for the once-monthly, or 6 for the once every 2-months dosing regimen, representing a paradigm shift in how we are able to treat and manage the condition. The long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine was as effective as treatment with current daily antiviral therapy in the clinical trials in maintaining viral suppression, is generally well tolerated, and could change the treatment experience for some people living with HIV that may have challenges with daily HIV therapies.”

Outlining the need for a less frequent dosing regimen, the largest global HIV patient-reported outcomes study to date conducted by ViiV Healthcare, Positive Perspectives Wave 2, found that when participants were asked about their treatment aspirations and attitudes towards innovative medications, 55% (n=1306/2389) would prefer not having to take medication every day, as long as their HIV stays suppressed.2 In addition, 58% (n=1394/2389) noted that taking daily HIV medication acts as a constant reminder of HIV in their lives, while up to 38% (n=906/2389) of participants reported anxiety around the fact that taking daily treatment could increase the chances of revealing their HIV status to others.3

Deborah Waterhouse, CEO, ViiV Healthcare, said: “At ViiV Healthcare, we push the boundaries to provide new treatment options that will help make a difference to people’s lives. We saw from the patient reported outcomes in our pivotal clinical trials that approximately 9 out of 10 people who switched to the long-acting regimen preferred this over their previous daily oral tablets.4,5,6 It will potentially change the treatment experience for some people living with HIV by removing the need for daily HIV tablets. We are committed to pursuing innovative research to meet the diverse needs of the HIV community, and we won’t stop until we have more ways to treat, and hopefully one day cure, HIV.”

Marketing Authorisation is based on the pivotal phase III ATLAS (Antiretroviral Therapy as Long-Acting Suppression), FLAIR (First Long-Acting Injectable Regimen) and ATLAS-2M studies, which included more than 1,200 participants from 16 countries.4,5,6 Cabotegravir and rilpivirine are co-administered as two intramuscular (IM) injections in the buttocks by a Healthcare Professional at the same appointment.

ViiV Healthcare’s cabotegravir in combination with Janssen’s rilpivirine was co-developed as part of a collaboration with Janssen and builds on ViiV Healthcare’s industry-leading portfolio that is centered on delivering innovative medicines for the HIV community.

This announcement marks the second marketing authorisation of the long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine, with once-monthly dosing licensed by Health Canada under the brand name Cabenuva for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who are virologically stable and suppressed. In July, ViiV Healthcare resubmitted the New Drug Application (NDA) for once-monthly dosing of cabotegravir and rilpivirine to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and further regulatory applications have been submitted and are being reviewed by other regulatory bodies worldwide.

Notes to editor

About cabotegravir
Cabotegravir is an INI developed by ViiV Healthcare for the treatment of HIV-1 in virologically suppressed adults. It is being evaluated in combination with injectable rilpivirine as a long-acting formulation.

INSTIs, like cabotegravir, inhibit HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection.

About rilpivirine and rilpivirine long-acting
The oral formulation of rilpivirine is also authorised for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretroviral agents in antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 35 kg with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL.

Rilpivirine long-acting is a prolonged-release suspension for IM injection being developed by Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson.

Rilpivirine is an NNRTI that works by interfering with an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which in turn stops the virus from multiplying.

Administration and dosing of cabotegravir and rilpivirine
Cabotegravir injection used in combination with rilpivirine injection will be the first complete long-acting regimen dosed once-monthly or once every 2-months, for virologically suppressed people living with HIV-1. Cabotegravir and rilpivirine injections are administered as two IM injections in the buttocks by a Healthcare Professional at the same appointment. Prior to the initiation of the injections, cabotegravir and rilpivirine oral tablets are taken for approximately one month (at least 28 days) to assess tolerability to the medicines.

Important Safety Information (ISI)
The following Important Safety Information is based on the Summary of Product Characteristics for Vocabria. Please consult the full Summary of Product Characteristics for all the safety information.

Vocabria (cabotegravir) injection is indicated, in combination with rilpivirine injection, for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class.

Vocabria injection is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 in combination with rilpivirine injection, therefore, the prescribing information for rilpivirine injection should be consulted for recommended dosing.

Vocabria tablets are indicated in combination with rilpivirine tablets for the short-term treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class for:

oral lead in to assess tolerability of Vocabria and rilpivirine prior to administration of long acting Vocabria injection plus long acting rilpivirine injection.
oral therapy for adults who will miss planned dosing with Vocabria injection plus rilpivirine injection.
Vocabria tablets are only indicated for treatment of HIV-1 in combination with rilpivirine tablets, therefore, the prescribing information for Edurant tablets should also be consulted for recommended dosing.

Prior to starting Vocabria injection, healthcare professionals should have carefully selected patients who agree to the required injection schedule and counsel patients about the importance of adherence to scheduled dosing visits to help maintain viral suppression and reduce the risk of viral rebound and potential development of resistance with missed doses.

Following discontinuation of Vocabria and rilpivirine injection, it is essential to adopt an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than one month after the final injection of Vocabria when dosed monthly and no later than two months after the final injection of Vocabria when dosed every 2 months.

Elderly (≥65 years of age): No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients. There are limited data available on the use of cabotegravir in patients aged 65 years and over.

Paediatrics (<18 years of age): The safety and efficacy of Vocabria in children and adolescents aged under 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to cabotegravir or rilpivirine or to any of the excipients.

Concomitant use with: rifampicin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital.

Special Warnings and Precautions for Use

Vocabria injection

Risk of resistance following treatment discontinuation

To minimise the risk of developing viral resistance it is essential to adopt an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than one month after the final injection of Vocabria when dosed monthly and no later than two months after the final injection of Vocabria when dosed every 2 months.

Residual concentrations of cabotegravir may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for prolonged periods (up to 12 months or longer), therefore, physicians should take the prolonged release characteristics of Vocabria injection into consideration when the medicinal product is discontinued.

If virologic failure is suspected, an alternative regimen should be adopted as soon as possible.

Baseline factors associated with virological failure
Before starting the regimen, it should be taken into account that multivariable analyses indicate that a combination of at least 2 of the following baseline factors may be associated with an increased risk of virological failure: archived rilpivirine resistance mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI ≥30 kg/m2. In patients with an incomplete or uncertain treatment history without pre-treatment resistance analyses, caution is warranted in the presence of either BMI ≥30 kg/m2 or HIV-1 A6/A1 subtype.

Hypersensitivity reactions
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with other integrase inhibitors. These reactions were characterised by rash, constitutional findings and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury. While no such reactions have been observed to date in association with Vocabria, physicians should remain vigilant and should discontinue Vocabria and other suspected medicinal products immediately, should signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash, or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia or angioedema). Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Administration of oral lead-in is recommended to help identify patients who may be at risk of a hypersensitivity reaction.

Hepatoxicity
Hepatotoxicity has been reported in a limited number of patients receiving Vocabria with or without known pre-existing hepatic disease.

Monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended and treatment with Vocabria should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity is suspected.

HBV/HCV co-infection
Patients with hepatitis B co-infection were excluded from studies with Vocabria. It is not recommended to initiate Vocabria in patients with hepatitis B co-infection. Physicians should refer to current treatment guidelines for the management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus.

Limited data is available in patients with hepatitis C co-infection. Monitoring of liver function is recommended in patients with hepatitis C co-infection.

Interactions with medicinal products
Caution should be given to prescribing Vocabria injection and tablets with medicinal products that may reduce its exposure.

Concomitant use of Vocabria injection with rifabutin is not recommended.

Polyvalent cation containing antacids are recommended to be taken at least 2 hours before and 4 hours after taking Vocabria tablets.

Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir
Cabotegravir is primarily metabolised by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1 and to a lesser extent by UGT1A9. Medicinal products which are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or UGT1A9 are expected to decrease cabotegravir plasma concentrations leading to lack of efficacy.

Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (ARs) from monthly dosing studies were injection site reactions (up to 84%), headache (up to 12%) and pyrexia* (10%).

The most frequently reported ARs from ATLAS-2M every 2-month dosing were injection site reactions (76%), headache (7%) and pyrexia* (7%).

*Pyrexia includes the following: feeling hot, body temperature increased.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Local injection site reactions (ISRs)
Up to 1% of subjects discontinued treatment with Vocabria plus rilpivirine because of ISRs. When dosing monthly, up to 84% of subjects reported injection site reactions; out of 30393 injections, 6815 ISRs were reported. When dosing every 2 months, 76% of patients reported injection site reactions; out of 8470 injections, 2507 ISRs were reported.

The severity of reactions was generally mild (Grade 1, 70%-75% of subjects) or moderate (Grade 2, 27%-36% of subjects). 3-4% of subjects experienced severe (Grade 3) ISRs. The median duration of overall ISR events was 3 days. The percentage of subjects reporting ISRs decreased over time.

Weight increased
At the Week 48 time point, subjects in studies FLAIR and ATLAS, who received Vocabria plus rilpivirine gained a median of 1.5 kg in weight subjects continuing on their current antiretroviral therapy (CAR) gained a median of 1.0 kg (pooled analysis). In the individual studies FLAIR and ATLAS, the median weight gains in the Vocabria plus rilpivirine arms were 1.3 kg and 1.8 kg respectively, compared to 1.5 kg and 0.3 kg in the CAR arms.

At the 48 week timepoint, in ATLAS-2M the median weight gain in both the monthly and 2-monthly CAB+RPV dosing arms was 1.0 kg.

Pregnancy
There are a limited amount of data from the use of cabotegravir in pregnant women. The effect of Vocabria on human pregnancy is unknown.

Cabotegravir was not teratogenic when studied in pregnant rats and rabbits but, exposures higher than the therapeutic dose showed reproductive toxicity in animals. The relevance to human pregnancy is unknown.

Vocabria injection is not recommended during pregnancy unless the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.

Cabotegravir has been detected in systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer after an injection.

Breast-feeding
It is expected that cabotegravir will be secreted into human milk based on animal data, although this has not been confirmed in humans. Cabotegravir may be present in human milk for up to 12 months or longer after the last cabotegravir injection.

It is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

REKAMBYS (rilpivirine injection) ISI
The following Important Safety Information is based on the Summary of Product Characteristics for REKAMBYS (rilpivirine injection). Please consult the full Summary of Product Characteristics for all the safety information.

REKAMBYS is indicated, in combination with cabotegravir injection, for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV‑1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with, agents of the NNRTI and INI class

REKAMBYS should always be co-administered with a cabotegravir injection. The prescribing information for cabotegravir injection should be consulted for recommended dosing.

Prior to the initiation of REKAMBYS, rilpivirine oral tablets, together with cabotegravir oral tablets, should be taken for approximately 1 month (at least 28 days) to assess tolerability to rilpivirine and cabotegravir. One rilpivirine 25‑mg tablet should be taken with a meal with one cabotegravir 30‑mg tablet once daily.

Prior to starting REKAMBYS, the healthcare professional should carefully select patients who agree to the required injection schedule and counsel patients about the importance of adherence to scheduled dosing visits to help maintain viral suppression and reduce the risk of viral rebound and potential development of resistance associated with missed doses.

Following discontinuation of REKAMBYS in combination with cabotegravir injection, it is essential to adopt an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than one month after the last every 1 month injection of REKAMBYS or two months after the last every 2 months injection of REKAMBYS.

Elderly: There is limited information regarding the use of REKAMBYS in patients > 65 years of age. No dose adjustment of REKAMBYS is required in older patients.

Paediatric Patients: The safety and efficacy of REKAMBYS in children and adolescents aged < 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.

REKAMBYS must not be co‑administered with the following medicinal products, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect of REKAMBYS:

the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin
the antimycobacterials rifabutin, rifampicin, rifapentine
the systemic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, except as a single dose treatment
St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).
Special Warnings and Precautions for Use

Risk of resistance following treatment discontinuation

To minimise the risk of developing viral resistance it is essential to adopt an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than one month after the last every 1 month injection of REKAMBYS or two months after the last every 2 months injection of REKAMBYS.

Long-acting properties of rilpivirine injection
Residual concentrations of rilpivirine may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for prolonged periods (up to 4 years in some patients) and should be considered upon discontinuation of REKAMBYS.

Baseline factors associated with virological failure
Before starting the regimen, it should be taken into account that multivariable analyses indicate that a combination of at least 2 of the following baseline factors may be associated with an increased risk of virological failure: archived rilpivirine resistance mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI ≥30 kg/m2. In patients with an incomplete or uncertain treatment history without pre-treatment resistance analyses, caution is warranted in the presence of BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and/or HIV‑1 subtype A6/A1.

Post-injection reactions
Partial intravenous administration may result in AEs due to temporarily high plasma concentrations. In clinical studies, serious post-injection reactions were reported within minutes after the injection of rilpivirine, including dyspnoea, agitation, abdominal cramping, flushing, sweating, oral numbness, and changes in blood pressure. These events were very rare and began to resolve within a few minutes after the injection.

Carefully follow the Instructions for Use when preparing and administering REKAMBYS to avoid accidental intravenous administration. Observe patients briefly (approximately 10 minutes) after the injection. If a patient experiences a post-injection reaction, monitor and treat as clinically indicated.

Cardiovascular
REKAMBYS should be used with caution when co‑administered with a medicinal product with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. At supra‑therapeutic doses (75 and 300 mg once daily), oral rilpivirine has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG). Oral rilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant effect on QTc. Plasma rilpivirine concentrations after REKAMBYS injections are comparable to those during such oral rilpivirine therapy.

HBV/HCV co-infection
Patients with hepatitis B co-infection were excluded from studies with REKAMBYS. It is not recommended to initiate REKAMBYS in patients with hepatitis B co-infection. In patients co‑infected with hepatitis B receiving oral rilpivirine, the incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation was higher than in patients receiving oral rilpivirine who were not hepatitis B co‑infected. Physicians should refer to current treatment guidelines for the management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus.

Limited data is available in patients with hepatitis C co-infection. In patients co‑infected with hepatitis C receiving oral rilpivirine, the incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation was higher than in patients receiving oral rilpivirine who were not hepatitis C co‑infected. The pharmacokinetic exposure of oral and injectable rilpivirine in co‑infected patients was comparable to that in patients without hepatitis C co‑infection. Monitoring of liver function is recommended in patients with hepatitis C co-infection.

Interactions with other medicinal products
REKAMBYS should not be administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products, except for cabotegravir injection for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

Pregnancy
There are limited data of REKAMBYS in pregnant women. REKAMBYS is not recommended during pregnancy unless the expected benefit justifies the potential risk. Lower exposures of oral rilpivirine were observed when rilpivirine 25 mg once daily was taken during pregnancy. In the Phase 3 studies with oral rilpivirine, lower rilpivirine exposure, similar to that seen during pregnancy, has been associated with an increased risk of virological failure, therefore viral load should be monitored closely. Alternatively, switching to another ART regimen could be considered.

Undesirable effects
The most frequently reported ARs from every 1 month dosing studies were injection site reactions (up to 84%), headache (up to 12%) and pyrexia (10%).

The most frequently reported ARs from every 2 months dosing were injection site reactions (76%), headache (7%) and pyrexia (7%).

Tabulated list of adverse reactions is available in the full information leaflet.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Local Injection Site Reactions (ISRs)

Up to 1% of subjects discontinued treatment with rilpivirine and cabotegravir injections because of ISRs. When dosing every 1 month in ATLAS, FLAIR, and ATLAS-2M (Q4W arm), up to 84% of subjects reported injections site reactions; out of 30393 injections, 6815 ISRs were reported. When dosing every 2 months in ATLAS-2M (Q8W arm), 76% of subjects reported injection site reactions; out of 8470 injections, 2507 ISRs were reported.

Injection site reactions were generally mild (Grade 1, 70%-75% of subjects) or moderate (Grade 2, 27%-36% of subjects). 3-4% of subjects experienced severe (Grade 3) ISRs. The median duration of ISR events was 3 days. The percentage of subjects reporting ISRs decreased over time.

Weight increased
At the Week 48 time point, subjects in Phase 3 Studies FLAIR and ATLAS, who received rilpivirine plus cabotegravir gained a median of 1.5 kg in weight; subjects continuing on their current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) group gained a median of 1.0 kg (pooled analysis). In the individual studies FLAIR and ATLAS, the median weight gains in the rilpivirine plus cabotegravir arms were 1.3 kg and 1.8 kg respectively, compared to 1.5 kg and 0.3 kg in the CAR arms.

At the 48 week timepoint, in ATLAS-2M the median weight gain in both the monthly and every 2 months rilpivirine + cabotegravir dosing arms was 1.0 kg.

Pregnancy
The effect of REKAMBYS on human pregnancy is unknown. A moderate amount of data with oral rilpivirine in pregnant women (between 300-1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or foetal/neonatal toxicity of rilpivirine. A study of 19 pregnant women treated with oral rilpivirine in combination with a background regimen during the second and third trimesters, and postpartum, showed lower exposures of oral rilpivirine during pregnancy, therefore viral load should be monitored closely if REKAMBYS is used during pregnancy.

Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity. REKAMBYS is not recommended during pregnancy unless the expected benefit justifies the potential risk.

An alternative oral regimen should be considered in line with current treatment guidelines. After discontinuation of REKAMBYS, rilpivirine may remain in systemic circulation for up to 4 years in some patients.

Breast-feeding
It is expected that rilpivirine will be secreted into human milk based on animal data, although this has not been confirmed in humans. Rilpivirine may be present in human milk for up to 4 years in some patients after discontinuation of REKAMBYS.

It is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

EDURANT should not be co‑administered with the following medicinal products, as significant decreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations may occur (due to CYP3A enzyme induction or gastric pH increase), which may result in loss of therapeutic effect of EDURANT:

the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin
the antimycobacterials rifampicin, rifapentine
proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole
the systemic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, except as a single dose treatment
St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).
Special Warnings and Precautions for Use
While effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.

Virologic failure and development of resistance
EDURANT has not been evaluated in patients with previous virologic failure to any other antiretroviral therapy.

In the pooled efficacy analysis from the Phase III trials in adults through 96 weeks, patients treated with rilpivirine with a baseline viral load > 100,000 HIV‑1 RNA copies/ml had a greater risk of virologic failure (18.2% with rilpivirine versus 7.9% with efavirenz) compared to patients with a baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV‑1 RNA copies/ml (5.7% with rilpivirine versus 3.6% with efavirenz). The greater risk of virologic failure for patients in the rilpivirine arm was observed in the first 48 weeks of these trials. Patients with a baseline viral load > 100,000 HIV‑1 RNA copies/ml who experienced virologic failure exhibited a higher rate of treatment‑emergent resistance to the non‑nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class. More patients who failed virologically on rilpivirine than who failed virologically on efavirenz developed lamivudine/emtricitabine associated resistance.

As with other antiretroviral medicinal products, resistance testing should guide the use of rilpivirine.

Cardiovascular
At supra‑therapeutic doses (75 and 300 mg once daily), rilpivirine has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG). EDURANT at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant effect on QTc. EDURANT should be used with caution when co‑administered with medicinal products with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.

Immune reactivation syndrome
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

Pregnancy
Edurant should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. Lower exposures of rilpivirine were observed when rilpivirine 25 mg once daily was taken during pregnancy. In the Phase III studies, lower rilpivirine exposure, similar to that seen during pregnancy, has been associated with an increased risk of virological failure, therefore viral load should be monitored closely. Alternatively, switching to another ART regimen could be considered.

Important information about some of the ingredients of EDURANT
EDURANT contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose‑galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

Undesirable effects
During the clinical development program (1,368 patients in the Phase III controlled trials TMC278‑C209 (ECHO) and TMC278‑C215 (THRIVE)), 55.7% of subjects experienced at least one adverse drug reaction. The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥ 2%) that were at least of moderate intensity were depression (4.1%), headache (3.5%), insomnia (3.5%), rash (2.3%), and abdominal pain (2.0%). The most frequent serious treatment-related ADRs were reported in 7 (1.0%) patients receiving rilpivirine. The median duration of exposure for patients in the rilpivirine arm and efavirenz arm was 104.3 and 104.1 weeks, respectively. Most ADRs occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment.

Selected treatment emergent clinical laboratory abnormalities (grade 3 or grade 4), considered as ADRs, reported in EDURANT treated patients were increased pancreatic amylase (3.8%), increased AST (2.3%), increased ALT (1.6%), increased LDL cholesterol (fasted, 1.5%), decreased white blood cell count (1.2%), increased lipase (0.9%), increased bilirubin (0.7%), increased triglycerides (fasted, 0.6%), decreased haemoglobin (0.1%), decreased platelet count (0.1%), and increased total cholesterol (f",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Website-Size-2020-12-21T153926.991.jpg,Regulatory,ViiV Healthcare|Pfizer|Shionogi|Janssen | Edurant,Vocabria,HIV|Regulatory|EC Marketing Authorization| Receives|Rekambys,publish,21/12/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/viiv-healthcare-announces-the-marketing-authorisation-of-the-first-complete-long-acting-injectable-hiv-treatment-in-europe/,https://pharmashots.com/53812/viiv-healthcares-first-long-acting-injectable-receive-ecs-approval-for-the-treatment-of-hiv/

 Ultragenyx to lead the global development of Setrusumab in both pediatric & adult patients. Ultragenyx gets an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Setrusumab in the US & ROW (Ex- EU) where Mereo retains commercial rights. Each party will be responsible for post-marketing commitments in their respective territories
 As per the 2015 agreement with Novartis, Mereo will pay Novartis a percentage of proceeds with Mereo receiving a substantial majority of the payments from Ultragenyx","NOVATO, Calif., LONDON, and REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Dec. 17, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq: RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel products for serious rare and ultra-rare diseases, and Mereo BioPharma Group plc (Nasdaq: MREO, AIM: MPH), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology and rare diseases, today announced a license and collaboration agreement for setrusumab, a monoclonal antibody in clinical development for osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Setrusumab is an investigational anti-sclerostin fully human monoclonal antibody that has shown the ability to improve bone production and density leading to greater bone strength in animal models of OI. Data from a Phase2b of setrusumab conducted by Mereo demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in bone formation, density, and strength in adults with OI.

“Setrusumab is a great complement to Ultragenyx’s product portfolio and enables us to leverage the broad expertise and infrastructure we have established in metabolic bone diseases with Crysvita,” stated Emil D. Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Ultragenyx. “Most importantly, setrusumab is a promising option for patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, which is one of the most common genetic bone diseases associated with frequent bone fractures.”

“Osteogenesis imperfecta is a rare and devastating genetic disease, with currently no approved therapies. We are proud to partner with Ultragenyx to continue the development of setrusumab as potentially the first approved therapy for OI in both children and adults,” said Dr. Denise Scots-Knight, Chief Executive Officer of Mereo. “Following the positive data from our Phase 2b ASTEROID study, we set out to find the right partner and we believe that Ultragenyx, with its proven track record of successfully developing and commercializing novel therapies for rare diseases, is ideally positioned to support the further advancement of our innovative therapeutic candidate. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Ultragenyx to make setrusumab available to the OI community worldwide.”

OI is a group of genetic disorders including types I, III and IV, of which approximately 85-90% are caused by mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes leading to either a reduced amount of normal collagen or collagen with abnormal structure and changes in bone metabolism. Since collagen molecules represent the foundation upon which bone is formed, these abnormalities lead to increased bone resorption, reduced bone mass, and bone fragility and weakness. Although the abnormal or deficient collagen weakens bone, these collagen abnormalities also set off a maladaptive cascade of bone remodeling signals that enhance bone resorption, or the breaking down of bone, with inadequate production of new bone, which compounds the bone fragility. These genetic defects and their consequences lead to systemic clinical manifestations such as decreased bone mass, bone brittleness leading to a high rate of fractures, including at atypical sites, or bone deformities, including abnormal spine curvature, as well as pain, decreased mobility, and short stature. OI affects approximately 60,000 patients in the developed world and has no approved treatments.

Setrusumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits sclerostin, a protein that acts on a key bone-signaling pathway and inhibits the activity of bone-forming cells. By blocking inhibitory effects of sclerostin, the anti-sclerostin antibody causes new bone formation, increased production of collagen, and increased bone mineral density and strength. Sclerostin inhibition also reduces excessive bone resorption, further enhancing the impact on bone density. In various mouse models of OI, the use of anti-sclerostin antibodies was shown to stimulate bone formation, improve bone mass and density, reduce bone fragility, increase long bone stiffness and strength, and reduce the number of fractures. Overall, improvements in bone mass and strength were enhanced when an anti-sclerostin antibody was used in combination with bisphosphonates, the current standard of care in OI.

Mereo has completed the Phase 2b ASTEROID study of setrusumab across three dose groups monthly for 12 months in 90 adults with OI types I, III, and IV. Results from the study indicated improvements in bone mineral density across multiple measures and at multiple anatomical sites on a dose-dependent basis after 12 months. Improvements were also observed in serum P1NP (procollagen type I N propeptide), a biomarker of bone formation and direct measure of collagen production. The bone mineral density and P1NP results were consistent across OI types studied. In addition, there was a dose-dependent improvement in trabecular bone architecture and bone strength by measuring wrist bone failure load and stiffness. In the per protocol population at the high dose, there was a trend toward improvement of ankle failure load and a statistically significant improvement in ankle bone stiffness. While the study was not powered to show a difference in fracture rates, there was a trend toward a reduction in fractures in the highest dose relative to the lower doses. In the study, setrusumab was generally well tolerated with no cardiac-related safety concerns observed.

The companies will expand and initially prioritize the development of setrusumab for pediatric patients with OI. Development plans are being finalized which may include changes to current study designs, and will require discussions with regulatory agencies, for a pediatric Phase 2/3 study that first focuses on determining the optimal dose based on increases in collagen production using serum P1NP levels and an acceptable safety profile. Following determination of the dose, the study is intended to adapt into a pivotal Phase 3 stage, evaluating fracture reduction over an estimated 15 to 24 months as the primary endpoint pending regulatory review. The pediatric Phase 2/3 study is expected to start in 2021. A separate pivotal study is also being planned for adults with OI.

Setrusumab has received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA, and was accepted into the EMA’s Priority Medicines program (PRIME).

Under the terms of the collaboration, Ultragenyx will lead future global development of setrusumab in both pediatric and adult patients. Mereo granted Ultragenyx an exclusive license to develop and commercialize setrusumab in the US and rest of the world, excluding Europe where Mereo retains commercial rights. Each party will be responsible for post-marketing commitments in their respective territories.

Ultragenyx will make an upfront payment of $50 million to Mereo and will fund global development of the program until approval, and has agreed to pay a total of up to $254 million upon achievement of certain clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones. Ultragenyx will pay tiered double digit percentage royalties to Mereo on net sales outside of Europe, and Mereo will pay a fixed double digit percentage royalty to Ultragenyx on net sales in Europe. Under the terms of its 2015 agreement with Novartis, Mereo will pay Novartis a percentage of proceeds, subject to certain deductions, with Mereo receiving a substantial majority of the payments from Ultragenyx.

The completion of the transaction is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR) review and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.

About Osteogenesis Imperfecta

Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by fragile bones and reduced bone mass resulting in bones that break easily, loose joints, and weakened teeth. In severe cases, those with OI may experience hundreds of fractures in a lifetime. In addition, people with OI often suffer muscle weakness, early hearing loss, fatigue, curved bones, scoliosis, respiratory problems, and short stature, leading to significant effects on overall health and quality of life. The majority of cases of OI (estimated at approximately 90%) are caused by a dominant mutation in a gene coding for type I collagen, a key component of healthy bone. Current treatment of OI is supportive, focusing on minimizing fractures and maximizing mobility, but to date, there are no FDA or EU approved treatments. OI is estimated to affect between 1 in 6,500 and 1 in 30,000 people globally.

53848,Moderna's mRNA-1273 Receives the US FDA's EUA Against COVID-19,Moderna Announces FDA Authorization of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in U.S.,"The US FDA has authorized EUA of mRNA-1273 vaccine against COVID-19 in individuals ≥18yrs. The delivery to the US govt. will begin imminently while Moderna will continue to gather additional data and plans to file BLA for full licensure in 2021
 Allocation and distribution will be prioritized according to populations identified by the CDC’s ACIP. The Company expects to have b/w 100-125M doses available globally in the Q1’21, with 85-100M of those available in the US
 The US govt. ordered total 200M doses to date & retains an option to purchase up to an additional 300M doses, ~20M doses will be delivered by the end of Dec 2020","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Dec. 18, 2020– Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) has authorized the emergency use of mRNA-1273, Moderna’s vaccine against COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age or older. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is now authorized for distribution and use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Delivery to the U.S. Government will begin immediately. Moderna will continue to gather additional data and plans to file a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the FDA requesting full licensure in 2021.

“I want to thank the thousands of participants in our clinical trials and the staff at our clinical trial sites who have been on the front lines of the fight against the virus. I want to thank the NIH and NIAID for their scientific leadership and our partners at BARDA and Operation Warp Speed who have been instrumental to accelerating our progress to this point. I also want to thank the Moderna team, our suppliers and our partners for their tireless work across research, development and manufacturing of our vaccine,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “I am proud of what the Moderna team has achieved in collaboration with our partners. We were able to create and manufacture the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in 11 months from sequence to authorization, while advancing clinical development with a Phase 1, Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 study of 30,000 participants. It has been a 10-year scientific, entrepreneurial and medical journey and I am thankful to all those who have helped us get here today. We remain focused on scaling up manufacturing to help us protect as many people as we can from this terrible disease.”

Under Operation Warp Speed, the Department of Defense (DoD), in partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will manage allocation and distribution of the vaccine in the United States. Allocation and distribution will be prioritized according to populations identified by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Approximately 20 million doses will be delivered to the U.S. government by the end of December 2020. The Company expects to have between 100 million and 125 million doses available globally in the first quarter of 2021, with 85-100 million of those available in the U.S.

Moderna would also like to underscore the importance of the CARES Act — and thank its bipartisan Congressional champions — specifically with respect to its significant commitment in funding to enable BARDA and Operation Warp Speed to simultaneously fund development and manufacturing ahead of approval.

The FDA based its recommendation on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the Company, including a data analysis from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study announced on November 30. The primary efficacy analysis conducted on 196 cases indicated a vaccine efficacy rate of 94.1%.

The most common solicited adverse reactions (ARs) after the two-dose series included injection site pain (88.2%), erythema (8.6%), swelling (12.2%), and ipsilateral lymphadenopathy (14.2%). While the majority of these ARs were grade 1 (mild) or grade 2 (moderate), there was a higher occurrence of grade 3 (severe) reactions after the second injection. The majority of local solicited ARs occurred within the first one to two days after injection and generally persisted for a median of one to two days. Safety data continue to accrue, and the study continues to be monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) appointed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All participants in the COVE study will continued to be monitored for two years for the duration of the study to assess long-term protection and safety.

A summary of the company’s work to date on COVID-19 can be found here.

About the Phase 3 COVE Study

The Phase 3 COVE trial is a randomized, 1:1 placebo-controlled study testing the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine at the 100 µg dose level in 30,000 participants in the U.S., ages 18 and older. The primary endpoint is the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease. Key secondary endpoints include prevention of severe COVID-19 disease and prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2. The trial will continue to accrue additional data relevant to safety and efficacy. The final estimates of vaccine efficacy for both primary and secondary endpoints will depend on the totality of data that will accumulate to inform the final analysis. Moderna worked closely with BARDA and the NIH, including NIAID’s COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN), to conduct the Phase 3 COVE study under Operation Warp Speed. Moderna’s partner PPD (Nasdaq: PPD), a leading global contract research organization providing comprehensive, integrated drug development, laboratory and lifecycle management services, has also been essential to the successful execution of the COVE study.

The Phase 3 COVE study was designed in collaboration with the FDA and NIH to evaluate Americans at risk of severe COVID-19 disease and completed enrollment of 30,000 participants ages 18 and older in the U.S. on October 22, including those at high risk of the severe complications of COVID-19 disease. The COVE study includes more than 7,000 Americans over the age of 65. It also includes more than 5,000 Americans who are under the age of 65 but have high-risk chronic diseases that put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19, such as diabetes, severe obesity and cardiac disease. These medically high-risk groups represent 42% of the total participants in the Phase 3 COVE study. The study also included communities that have historically been under-represented in clinical research and have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The study includes more than 11,000 participants from communities of color, representing 37% of the study population, which is similar to the diversity of the U.S. at large. This includes more than 6,000 participants who identify as Hispanic or LatinX, and more than 3,000 participants who identify as Black or African American.

About the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine

The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (previously referred to as mRNA-1273) is an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was co-developed by Moderna and investigators from NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to the NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of the vaccine was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing. On May 12, the FDA granted the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Fast Track designation. On May 29, the first participants in each age cohort: adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300) were dosed in the Phase 2 study of mRNA-1273. On July 8, the Phase 2 study completed enrollment.

Results from the second interim analysis of the NIH-led Phase 1 study of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups were published on September 29 in The New England Journal of Medicine. On July 28, results from a non-human primate preclinical viral challenge study evaluating the vaccine were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. On July 14, an interim analysis of the original cohorts in the NIH-led Phase 1 study of the vaccine was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. On November 30, Moderna announced the primary efficacy analysis of the Phase 3 study of the vaccine conducted on 196 cases. On November 30, the Company also announced that it filed for Emergency Use Authorization with the U.S. FDA and a Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) with the European Medicines Agency. On December 3, a letter to the editor was published in The New England Journal of Medicine reporting that participants in the Phase 1 study of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine retained high levels of neutralizing antibodies through 119 days following first vaccination (90 days following second vaccination). On December 18, 2020, the FDA authorized the emergency use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in individuals 18 years of age or older.

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is supporting the continued research and development of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine with $955 million in federal funding under contract no. 75A50120C00034. BARDA is reimbursing Moderna for 100 percent of the allowable costs incurred by the Company for conducting the program described in the BARDA contract. The U.S. government has agreed to purchase supply of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine under U.S. Department of Defense contract no. W911QY-20-C-0100.

The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has not been approved or licensed by the FDA, or any other health authority, but it has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA under an EUA.

AUTHORIZED USE:

Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is authorized for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 18 years of age and older.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Do not administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with a known history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Appropriate medical treatment to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Monitor Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/).
Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a diminished response to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients.

53857,AstraZeneca's Tagrisso (osimertinib) Receives the US FDA's Approval for the Adjuvant Treatment of Patients with Early-Stage EGFR-Mutated Lung Cancer,ADDING MULTIMEDIA TAGRISSO Approved in the US for the Adjuvant Treatment of Patients With Early-Stage EGFR-mutated Lung Cancer,"The approval is based on the P-III ADAURA trial assessing Tagrisso (80mg, qd) vs PBO in 682 patients with stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated
 Results: reduction in the risk of disease recurrence (83%); DFS results in the overall trial population in reducing the risk of disease recurrence (80%); @2 yrs. disease-free and alive patients (89% vs 52%)
 Tagrisso is an irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against CNS metastases and has received the US FDA BTD for patients in the early-stage disease setting. The therapy is under PR in China and regulatory review in the EU","The approval was granted under the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program. Five other countries participated in a concurrent submission and review process through FDA’s Project Orbis.

While up to 30% of all patients with NSCLC may be diagnosed early enough to have potentially curative surgery, disease recurrence is still common in early-stage disease and nearly half of patients diagnosed in Stage IB, and over three quarters of patients diagnosed in Stage IIIA, experience recurrence within five years.1-4

The approval was based on results from the ADAURA Phase III trial where TAGRISSO demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in the primary analysis population of patients with Stage II and IIIA EGFRm NSCLC, and also in the overall trial population of patients with Stage IB-IIIA disease, a key secondary endpoint.

Roy S. Herbst, MD, PhD, chief of Medical Oncology at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital, New Haven, CT and principal investigator in the ADAURA Phase III trial, said: “Adjuvant TAGRISSO has demonstrated an unprecedented disease-free survival benefit for early-stage lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations who face high rates of recurrence even after successful surgery and subsequent chemotherapy. This approval reinforces how critical it is to test all lung cancer patients for EGFR mutations before deciding how to treat them and regardless of their stage at diagnosis. This will help ensure as many patients as possible can benefit from this potentially practice-changing treatment.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “For the first time, a targeted, biomarker-driven treatment option is available to patients in the US with early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer. This approval dispels the notion that treatment is over after surgery and chemotherapy, as the ADAURA results show that TAGRISSO can dramatically change the course of this disease. We remain committed to treating cancer patients earlier, when they may still have a chance of being cured.”

Adjuvant treatment with TAGRISSO reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 83% in the primary endpoint of DFS in patients with Stage II and IIIA disease (hazard ratio [HR] 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-0.23; p<0.0001). DFS results in the overall trial population of patients with Stage IB-IIIA disease showed TAGRISSO reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 80% (HR 0.20; 95% CI 0.15-0.27; p<0.0001). At two years, 89% of patients treated with TAGRISSO remained alive and disease free versus 52% on placebo after surgery, the current standard of care. The safety and tolerability of TAGRISSO in this trial was consistent with previous trials in the metastatic setting.

TAGRISSO was recently granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients in the early-stage disease setting by the US FDA. In April 2020, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended for the ADAURA trial to be unblinded two years early based on a determination of overwhelming efficacy. Investigators and patients continue to participate in the trial and remain blinded to treatment. The results from the ADAURA trial were presented during the plenary session of the American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program in May 2020 and were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The US regulatory submission was reviewed under the FDA’s RTOR pilot program which aims to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. Five national health authorities collaborated with the FDA on this review through Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among international partners. These included Health Canada, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa), Swissmedic, and Singapore Health Sciences Authority. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency participated in the review as an observer.

In China, TAGRISSO is under priority review for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage EGFRm NSCLC based on the ADAURA Phase III trial. This indication is also under regulatory review in the EU and additional global submission discussions are ongoing.

TAGRISSO is a once-daily oral tablet approved for the 1st-line treatment of patients with metastatic EGFRm NSCLC and for the treatment of metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many other countries around the world.

TAGRISSO Important Safety Information

There are no contraindications for TAGRISSO
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 3.7% of the 1479 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.3% of cases were fatal. Withhold TAGRISSO and promptly investigate for ILD in patients who present with worsening of respiratory symptoms which may be indicative of ILD (eg, dyspnea, cough and fever). Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO if ILD is confirmed
Heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation occurred in TAGRISSO-treated patients. Of the 1479 TAGRISSO-treated patients in clinical trials, 0.8% were found to have a QTc >500 msec, and 3.1% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc >60 msec. No QTc-related arrhythmias were reported. Conduct periodic monitoring with ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs/symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia
Cardiomyopathy occurred in 3% of the 1479 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.1% of cardiomyopathy cases were fatal. A decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥10% from baseline and to <50% LVEF occurred in 3.2% of 1233 patients who had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment. In the ADAURA study, 1.5% (5/325) of TAGRISSO-treated patients experienced LVEF decreases ≥10% from baseline and a drop to <50%. Conduct cardiac monitoring, including assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment, in patients with cardiac risk factors. Assess LVEF in patients who develop relevant cardiac signs or symptoms during treatment. For symptomatic congestive heart failure, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO
Keratitis was reported in 0.7% of 1479 patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical trials. Promptly refer patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis (such as eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye) to an ophthalmologist
Postmarketing cases consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme major (EMM) have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO. Withhold TAGRISSO if SJS or EMM is suspected and permanently discontinue if confirmed
Postmarketing cases of cutaneous vasculitis including leukocytoclastic vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, and IgA vasculitis have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO. Withhold TAGRISSO if cutaneous vasculitis is suspected, evaluate for systemic involvement, and consider dermatology consultation. If no other etiology can be identified, consider permanent discontinuation of TAGRISSO based on severity
Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TAGRISSO. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 6 weeks after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception for 4 months after the final dose
Most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, anemia, rash, musculoskeletal pain, nail toxicity, neutropenia, dry skin, stomatitis, fatigue, and cough

Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.5 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.6 The majority of all NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease while approximately 25-30% present with resectable disease at diagnosis.1-3

For those with resectable tumors, the majority of patients eventually develop recurrence despite complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.4 Early-stage lung cancer diagnoses are often only made when the cancer is found on imaging for an unrelated condition.7,8

Approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and Europe, and 30-40% of patients in Asia have EGFRm NSCLC.9-11 These patients are particularly sensitive to treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which block the cell-signaling pathways that drive the growth of tumor cells.12

About ADAURA

ADAURA is a randomized, double-blinded, global, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with Stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated. Patients were treated with TAGRISSO 80 mg once-daily oral tablets or placebo for three years or until disease recurrence.

The trial enrolled in more than 200 centers across more than 20 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint was DFS in Stage II and IIIA patients and a key secondary endpoint was DFS in Stage IB, II and IIIA patients. The data readout was originally anticipated in 2022. The trial will continue to assess overall survival.

53862,Roche Reports Results of Faricimab in Two Global P-III Studies for Diabetic Macular Edema,"Roche’s faricimab meets primary endpoint and shows strong durability across two global phase III studies for diabetic macular edema, a leading cause of blindness","The P-III YOSEMITE & RHINE studies assessing faricimab vs aflibercept in 1891 people living with DME. The studies include 3 treatment arms: faricimab (6mg) administered at personalized dosing intervals of ~16wks and at fixed 8wks. intervals & aflibercept (2mg) at fixed 8wks. intervals
 The studies met its 1EPs i.e faricimab in both the doses demonstrated non-inferior visual acuity gains compared to aflibercept and was well tolerated with no new safety signals identified
 Faricimab is the first investigational bispecific Ab targeting 2 distinct pathways i.e., Ang-2 and VEGF-A, currently being evaluated in P-III TENAYA and LUCERNE studies for nAMD","Basel, 21 December 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced positive topline results from two identically designed global phase III studies, YOSEMITE and RHINE, evaluating its investigational bispecific antibody, faricimab, in people living with diabetic macular edema (DME). Both studies met their primary endpoint and showed that faricimab given every eight weeks and at personalised dosing intervals of up to 16 weeks demonstrated non-inferior visual acuity gains compared to aflibercept given every eight weeks. Faricimab was generally well-tolerated, with no new safety signals identified. The studies each have three treatment arms, with participants randomised to receive either faricimab or aflibercept at fixed eight-week intervals, or faricimab at personalised intervals of up to 16 weeks, following a loading phase.

In a secondary endpoint, across both studies, more than half of participants in the faricimab personalised dosing arms achieved an extended time between treatments of 16 weeks at year one. This is the first time any investigational medicine has achieved this level of durability in a phase III study of people with DME.

Worldwide, an estimated 21 million people are living with DME, a leading cause of vision loss among working-age adults.1 Whilst anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monotherapy injections have significantly reduced vision loss from DME, the treatment burden associated with frequent eye injections and physician visits can lead to under-treatment and, potentially, less than optimal vision outcomes.2,3 It has been almost a decade since a medicine with a new mechanism of action has been approved to treat DME.4 Faricimab is the first investigational bispecific antibody designed for the eye.5 It targets two distinct pathways – via angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and VEGF-A – that drive a number of retinal conditions, including DME.6

“These positive results show that faricimab has the potential to offer lasting vision improvements for people with diabetic macular edema, while also reducing the treatment burden associated with frequent eye injections,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We look forward to discussions with global regulatory authorities, with the aim of bringing this potential new treatment option to people with this condition as soon as possible.”

In addition to the YOSEMITE and RHINE studies, the phase III Rhone-X study is investigating the long-term safety and tolerability of faricimab for the treatment of DME.7 Faricimab is also being studied in the phase III TENAYA and LUCERNE studies as a potential treatment for neovascular or “wet” age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), an advanced form of AMD, which can cause rapid, severe and irreversible vision loss.8,9,10,11 Detailed results from the YOSEMITE and RHINE studies will be presented in February at Angiogenesis, Exudation, and Degeneration 2021, a medical symposium presented by Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, and submitted for approval for the treatment of DME around the world.

About the YOSEMITE and RHINE studies 5,12,13
YOSEMITE (NCT03622580) and RHINE (NCT03622593) are two identical, randomised, multicentre, double-masked, global phase III studies, evaluating the efficacy and safety of faricimab compared to aflibercept in 1,891 people living with diabetic macular edema (940 in YOSEMITE and 951 in RHINE). The studies each have three treatment arms: faricimab 6.0 mg administered at personalised dosing intervals of up to 16 weeks; faricimab 6.0 mg administered at fixed eight-week intervals; aflibercept 2.0 mg administered at fixed eight-week intervals. In all three arms, sham injections were administered at study visits when treatment injections were not scheduled, to maintain the masking of investigators and participants.

The primary endpoint of the studies is the average change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score (the best distance vision a person can achieve – including with correction such as glasses – when reading letters on an eye chart) from baseline at one year. Secondary endpoints include: safety; the percentage of participants in the personalised dosing arm receiving treatment every four, eight, 12 and 16 weeks, at week 52; the percentage of participants achieving a two-step or greater improvement from baseline in diabetic retinopathy severity at week 52; the percentage of participants achieving a gain of at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline over time; the percentage of participants avoiding a loss of at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline over time; and change in central subfield thickness from baseline over time.

About diabetic macular edema
Affecting around 21 million people globally, diabetic macular edema (DME) is a vision-threatening complication of diabetic retinopathy (DR).1 DR occurs when damage to blood vessels and the formation of new blood vessels causes blood and/or fluid to leak into the retina – a part of the eye that sends information to the brain, enabling sight.14 This leads to swelling, as well as blockage of blood supply to some areas of the retina.15 DME occurs when the damaged blood vessels leak into and cause swelling in the macula – the central area of the retina responsible for the sharp vision needed for reading and driving.14,16 The number of people with DME is expected to grow as the prevalence of diabetes increases.17 The condition is associated with blindness when left untreated and decreased quality of life.14,18 There remains a significant unmet need for more effective, longer-lasting therapies for people with DME.3

About faricimab
Faricimab is the first investigational bispecific antibody designed for the eye.5 It targets two distinct pathways – via angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) – that drive a number of retinal conditions.6 Ang-2 and VEGF-A contribute to vision loss by destabilising blood vessels, causing new leaky blood vessels to form and increasing inflammation.3 By independently blocking both pathways, faricimab is designed to stabilise blood vessels, potentially resulting in better vision outcomes, for longer, for people living with retinal conditions.3

About Roche in Ophthalmology
Roche is focused on saving people’s eyesight from the leading causes of vision loss through pioneering therapies. Through our innovation in the scientific discovery of new potential drug targets, personalised healthcare, molecular engineering, biomarkers and continuous drug delivery, we strive to design the right therapies for the right patients.

Our late stage pipeline includes two potential first-of-a-kind treatments, Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS) and faricimab, which are being evaluated in a number of retinal conditions including neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy. PDS is a permanent refillable eye implant that continuously delivers a customised formulation of ranibizumab over a period of months, potentially reducing the treatment burden associated with frequent eye injections.19,20 Faricimab is the first investigational bispecific antibody designed for the eye.5 It targets two distinct pathways – via angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) – that drive a number of retinal conditions, to stabilise blood vessels, potentially resulting in better vision, for longer.3,6 Our early stage pipeline includes gene therapies and treatments for geographic atrophy and other vision-threatening diseases, including rare and inherited conditions.

Applying our extensive experience, we have already brought breakthrough ophthalmic treatments to people living with vision loss through Lucentis®️* (ranibizumab injection), the first treatment approved to improve vision in people with certain retinal conditions.

 The acquisition is expected to close in Q2’21. The acquisition allows Servier to strengthen its product portfolio and drug development pipeline in oncology
 The transaction includes the transfer of Agios’ oncology portfolio and associated employees, including its Tibsovo and pipeline and clinical programs, including vorasidenib","PARIS and BOSTON, Dec. 21, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Servier, a global pharmaceutical company, today announced that it has entered into an agreement for the acquisition of Agios Pharmaceuticals’ oncology business including its commercial, clinical and research-stage oncology portfolio for up to $2 billion, including an upfront payment of $1.8 Billion and a potential $200 million in regulatory milestone, plus royalties. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ respective boards of directors. Subject to receipt of regulatory clearances and approval by Agios’ shareholders, the acquisition is expected to close in Q2 2021.

In-line with Servier’s strategy, this acquisition will enable the Group to strengthen its product portfolio and drug development pipeline in oncology. Given the important unmet medical needs in oncology, Servier has made oncology one of its strategic priorities, allocating 50% of its overall R&D budget1 to this therapeutic area. The acquisition will also significantly reinforce Servier’s presence in the U.S., where the Group has been operating since 2018.

“The strategic acquisition of Agios’ oncology business, including its precision medicine portfolio and pipeline, is aligned with our ambition to become a recognized player in oncology and further supports our commitment to provide innovative treatments to cancer patients with unmet medical needs. It is a key step for the Servier Group as it will significantly strengthen our position in the U.S. and reinforce our R&D capabilities in oncology,” stated Olivier Laureau, President of Servier. “We look forward to welcoming the experienced Agios oncology teams to Servier following the closing.”

“Agios is a leader in the cellular metabolism space with a proven track record of discovering, developing and commercializing precision medicines,” said David K. Lee, CEO, Servier Pharmaceuticals, the U.S. subsidiary of Servier. “The acquisition of Agios’ oncology business, including highly experienced talent from research, development, technical operations and commercial functions, allows for an immediate expansion of our U.S. business into other hematologic malignancies and provides the potential for longer-term growth into the solid tumor space, thus ensuring that we can serve more patients living with unmet cancer needs than ever before.”

“The sale of our oncology portfolio to Servier is a transformational milestone for Agios. We are proud of our heritage in oncology and the novel therapies we have advanced for patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, and we are pleased to have found an excellent home for our oncology portfolio in Servier, a successful, patient-focused, global pharmaceutical company,” said Jackie Fouse, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Agios. “Servier is committed to the oncology patient community and to investing in our assets and our people. This transaction will allow the oncology portfolio to grow and thrive with Servier.”

Transaction Details

The transaction includes the transfer of Agios’ oncology portfolio and associated employees, including its marketed medicine TIBSOVO® which is approved in the U.S. as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with IDH1-mutant relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and for adults with newly diagnosed IDH1-mutant AML who are ≥75 years old or who have comorbidities that preclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy. TIBSOVO® is also under investigation in two Phase 3 combination trials in newly diagnosed AML, and as a potential treatment for previously treated IDH1-mutant cholangiocarcinoma and IDH1-mutant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Servier will also acquire Agios’ co-commercialization responsibilities for Bristol Myers Squibb’s IDHIFA® (enasidenib) and conduct certain clinical development activities within the IDHIFA® development program.

In addition, the transaction includes Agios’ oncology pipeline and clinical programs, including vorasidenib, an investigational, brain-penetrant, dual inhibitor of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 which is currently being studied in the registration-enabling Phase 3 INDIGO study in patients with IDH-mutant low-grade glioma; AG-270, an investigational first-in-class methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) inhibitor being evaluated in combination with taxanes in patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer; AG-636, a novel inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH); and Agios’ oncology research programs.

All of Agios’ U.S.-based employees who primarily support the oncology business will receive a comparable offer at Servier.

 Result: The data showed that participants receiving therapy through IM experienced fewer injection site reactions (14.4 vs 32.1 %), safety profiles were similar. The frequency of injection site reactions and AEs were comparable in participants who were dosed with IM followed by SC, compared to SC followed by IM
 The approval expands the offerings to the individuals with RMS, providing treatment option combining safety & efficacy to optimize the treatment experience with a reduction in injection site reactions","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 21, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved a new intramuscular (IM) injection route of administration for PLEGRIDY® (peginterferon beta-1a) for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The new IM administration of PLEGRIDY provides the well-characterized efficacy and safety of the platform injectable along with the potential for reduction in injection site reactions. It is estimated that 2.5 million people live with MS across the globe, with some European countries demonstrating the highest prevalence of MS in the world.1 This approval adds to Biogen’s broad MS portfolio which includes the subcutaneous (SC) injection of PLEGRIDY and expands the range of treatment options available for people living with MS.

“The availability of a new intramuscular route of administration offers individuals living with relapsing MS an additional choice of a platform therapy, combining the safety and efficacy of PLEGRIDY, with the potential to significantly reduce injection site reactions,” said Maha Radhakrishnan, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Biogen. “As leaders in MS with our broad portfolio of therapies, we are focused on advancing the science to address the needs of patients by providing more treatment choices.”

The EC’s approval of PLEGRIDY for IM administration is based on data evaluating bioequivalence and adverse reactions associated with IM administration compared to SC administration in healthy volunteers. Bioequivalence between the two dosing regimens was confirmed and data show that participants receiving PLEGRIDY through IM administration experienced fewer injection site reactions in comparison to participants receiving SC administration (14.4 percent vs. 32.1 percent). The overall safety profiles were similar, and the frequency of injection site reactions and adverse events were comparable in participants who were dosed with IM followed by SC, compared to SC followed by IM.2

PLEGRIDY, the only pegylated interferon approved for use in relapsing MS, was first approved in the European Union in 2014 and is proven to significantly reduce important measures of MS disease activity with a well-characterized safety and tolerability profile. Biogen has also submitted a regulatory filing in the U.S. for the IM administration. The SC administration of PLEGRIDY is available in more than 60 countries.

About PLEGRIDY® (peginterferon beta-1a)
PLEGRIDY is a pegylated interferon dosed once every two weeks for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults, the most common form of MS. PLEGRIDY is currently approved in over 60 countries including the U.S., Canada, Australia and Switzerland and across the European Union. Over 57,000 people worldwide have been treated with PLEGRIDY, with over 107,000 patient-years of experience, based on prescription data.3 Biogen continues to work toward making PLEGRIDY available in additional countries across the globe.

The efficacy and safety of PLEGRIDY are supported by one of the largest pivotal studies with interferons conducted in people living with relapsing-remitting MS. In clinical studies, PLEGRIDY has been proven to significantly reduce the rate of MS relapses, slow the progression of disability and reduce the number of MS brain lesions while demonstrating a well-characterized safety profile for patients with relapsing forms of MS. Side effects reported include liver problems, including liver failure and increases in liver enzymes; depression or suicidal thoughts; serious allergic reactions; cardiac problems, including congestive heart failure; autoimmune disorders; decreases in white blood cell or platelet counts; and seizures. In clinical trials, the most common adverse events associated with PLEGRIDY were injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms. A list of adverse events can be found in the full PLEGRIDY product labeling for each country where it is approved. PLEGRIDY can be considered for use in MS patients throughout the full course of pregnancy and during breast-feeding, if clinically needed.

The approval follows CHMP’s positive opinion to authorize the vaccine
 The P-III demonstrated 95% ER in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from 7 days after the second dose
 The CMA is valid in all 27 member states of the EU while the companies are ready to immediately ship initial doses to all the member state","NEW YORK & MAINZ, Germany–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) announced today that the European Commission (EC) has granted a conditional marketing authorization (CMA) to Pfizer and BioNTech for COMIRNATY® (also known as BNT162b2), for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older. This follows the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) positive opinion to authorize the vaccine earlier today. The EC granted this CMA in the interest of public health to help address the COVID-19 pandemic. The CMA is valid in all 27 member states of the European Union (EU).

The vaccine will be marketed in the EU under the brand name COMIRNATY, which represents a combination of the terms COVID-19, mRNA, community, and immunity, to highlight the first authorization of a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, as well as the joint global efforts that made this achievement possible with unprecedented rigor and efficiency – and with safety at the forefront – during this global pandemic. COMIRNATY is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive CMA in the EU. The distribution of COMIRNATY by the EU member states will be determined according to the populations identified in EU and national guidance.

“The conditional marketing authorization by the European Commission is an historic achievement. It is the first vaccine which has been developed in a large-scale trial with more than 44,000 participants and approved in less than a year to address this pandemic. This is based on the decade-long pioneering work by many scientists from all over the world. This achievement is also a testament to the successful collaboration with our partner Pfizer,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “As a company founded and headquartered in the heart of Europe, we are looking forward to delivering the vaccine to Europeans in the upcoming days. We believe that vaccinations may help reduce the number of people in high-risk populations being hospitalized. Moving forward, we will continue to collect efficacy and safety data in participants for an additional two years and test the vaccine against additional mutations that might occur.”

“With the pandemic still raging in many countries, we are continuing to work around the clock to bring this vaccine to the world as quickly, efficiently and equitably as possible,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “I am truly grateful for the collaboration with our partner BioNTech, and to the European Medicines Agency and European Commission for their thorough and efficient review to help us defeat a virus that has already claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Europe. We are grateful that this authorization is bringing hope to people across the continent, as we hopefully turn the corner of this crisis and approach the new year.”

The EU authorization is based on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the companies as part of the EMA’s rolling review process and the application for CMA, which the companies submitted on December 1, 2020. This included data from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study announced last month and published recently in The New England Journal of Medicine. The Phase 3 data demonstrated a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and also in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from 7 days after the second dose. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for the study has not reported safety concerns related to the vaccine. Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. All trial participants will continue to be monitored to assess the duration of protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose.

Following today’s CMA, Pfizer and BioNTech will initiate delivery of the first vaccine doses immediately across the EU based on a distribution plan defined by the EC and contract terms. In November 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech reached an agreement with the EC to supply 200 million doses of a vaccine for COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021, with the option for up to 100 million additional doses, subject to agreement of the parties. Delivery will begin immediately, and occur in stages, throughout 2020 and 2021, to ensure an equitable allocation of vaccines according to contract terms across the EU. Vaccine doses for Europe will be produced in BioNTech’s manufacturing sites in Germany, and Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium.

Pfizer and BioNTech appreciate the continued participation of the more than 44,000 trial volunteers, and remain committed to the companies’ pledge to always make their safety and well-being the companies’ top priority. The participants in the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial are courageous volunteers who have made a personal and important choice to help make a difference during this pandemic. Pfizer and BioNTech are providing a vaccine transition option that enables trial participants 16 years and over who received the placebo to receive the vaccine as part of the study. This option is voluntary and is being implemented in a phased manner.

With this EU authorization in all 27 EU member states, the COVID-19 vaccine has now been granted a conditional marketing authorization, emergency use authorization or a temporary authorization in a total of more than 40 countries.1 Regulatory reviews are underway in several countries, with more authorizations anticipated in the coming weeks.

About the Phase 2/3 Study
The ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2, which is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, has enrolled more than 44,000 participants, the vast majority of whom have received their second dose. A breakdown of the diversity of clinical trial participants can be found here which includes information from more than 150 clinical trials sites in the U.S., Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina.

The Phase 3 trial is designed as a 1:1 vaccine candidate to placebo, randomized, observer-blinded study to obtain safety, immune response, and efficacy data needed for regulatory review. The trial’s primary endpoints are prevention of COVID-19 in those who have not been infected by SARS-CoV-2 prior to immunization, and prevention of COVID-19 regardless of whether participants have previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Secondary endpoints include prevention of severe COVID-19 in those groups. The study also will explore prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Data from this study, including longer term safety, comprehensive information on duration of protection, efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and safety and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age, will be gathered in the months ahead. Additional studies are planned to evaluate BNT162b2 in pregnant women, children younger than 12 years, and those in special risk groups, such as the immunocompromised.

Manufacturing and Delivery Capabilities
Pfizer and BioNTech continue to work in collaboration with governments and Ministries of Health around the world that will distribute the vaccine, subject to country authorization or approval and terms of supply agreements, to help ensure it can reach those most in need as quickly as possible. The companies are leveraging Pfizer’s leading vaccine manufacturing and distribution capabilities to quickly scale, manufacture and distribute large quantities of the vaccine at high quality, complementing BioNTech’s mRNA manufacturing expertise gained over almost a decade. Pfizer has a 171-year track record of researching, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative medicines and vaccines to patients in need. Pfizer and BioNTech are confident in their ability to deliver the vaccine to people in the EU. Based on current projections, Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s combined manufacturing network has the potential to supply globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021 (subject to manufacturing capacity and regulatory approval or authorization).

Through its existing mRNA production sites in Germany, BioNTech is able to produce the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for commercial supply after having already produced the vaccine candidate doses for the clinical trials. BioNTech will also increase its manufacturing capacity in 2021, once a third site in Marburg, Germany will start manufacturing to provide further capacities for a global supply of the vaccine. Critical to distribution in Europe will be Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of Pfizer’s largest sterile injectable sites. The Puurs site is being used primarily for European supply but will also serve as back up supply to Kalamazoo, Michigan, for the U.S. market.

Pfizer has vast experience and expertise in cold-chain shipping and has an established infrastructure to supply the vaccine worldwide, including distribution hubs where vaccine can be stored until its expiration. The company’s distribution is built on a flexible just-in-time system that can ship the frozen vials quickly to designated points of vaccination at the time of need, minimizing the need for long term storage. Vaccination in a pandemic situation is expected to be rapid, and we do not expect that the product will need to be stored at any location for more than 30 days. To assure product quality, the companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers for the vaccine, which can maintain recommended shipping conditions (-90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF)) for extended periods of time with dry ice. The shipper can maintain temperature for 10 days unopened which allows for transportation to markets globally. Once open, a vaccination center may store the vaccine in an Ultra-Low Temperature freezer at (-70°C ±10°C) for up to six months, or use the specially designed shippers as a temporary storage solution to maintain the required temperatures for up to 30 days with re-icing every five days in accordance with the handling instructions. Each shipper contains a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of each vaccine shipment 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored safely for up to five days at refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions.

From the start of the research program earlier this year, Pfizer and BioNTech have successfully supplied and distributed their investigational vaccine to more than 150 clinical trial sites across the U.S., as well as Europe, Latin America and South Africa reaching more than 44,000 participants. Based on their collective experience, the companies believe in their capability to distribute the vaccine globally upon approval or authorization. BioNTech will hold the regulatory authorization in the U.S., U.K., Canada, EU, and, if authorized, in other countries. Pfizer will have marketing and distribution rights worldwide with the exception of China, Germany, and Turkey.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has not been approved or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for use in individuals 16 years of age and older.

53888,AstraZeneca's Tezepelumab Fails to Meet its Primary Endpoint in P-III SOURCE Study for Asthma,"Update on SOURCE Phase III trial for tezepelumab in patients with severe, oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma","The P-III SOURCE study involves assessing Tezepelumab (210mg, q4w) vs PBO in 150 adult patients as add-on therapy with patients maintained on their currently prescribed ICS + LABA, with/ out other asthma controller therapy for 48wks.
 The trial did not meet its 1EPs i.e., reduction in the daily OCS dose, without loss of asthma control, the safety profile was consistent with previous trials. The therapy’s other efficacy parameters were similar to those observed in previous trials, including the P-III NAVIGATOR trial
 Tezepelumab is a human mAb targeting TSLP, being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca and Amgen","AstraZeneca and Amgen today announced high-level results from the SOURCE Phase III trial which assessed the efficacy and safety of the potential new medicine tezepelumab compared to placebo in 150 severe asthma patients who required maintenance use of oral corticosteroids (OCS) on top of standard of care (SoC).

The 48-week trial did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in the daily OCS dose, without loss of asthma control, with tezepelumab compared to placebo. Tezepelumab’s effect on other efficacy parameters was similar to those observed in previous trials, including the registrational Phase III NAVIGATOR trial.

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Based on the totality of evidence, including the compelling exacerbation reduction results seen in the registrational NAVIGATOR Phase III trial and the PATHWAY Phase IIb trial, we remain confident that tezepelumab has the potential to improve care for a broad population of severe asthma patients. Our initial analysis of SOURCE in oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma indicates that the trial design may have contributed to the result of the primary endpoint. We are in the process of further analysing the data from SOURCE and look forward to sharing these results with the medical community.”

The safety profile of tezepelumab in the trial was consistent with previous trials. Detailed results from the SOURCE trial will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

On 10 November 2020, AstraZeneca and Amgen announced positive results from the NAVIGATOR Phase III trial which met the primary endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) in a broad population of patients with severe asthma, including those with low levels of eosinophils.

Tezepelumab is a potential first-in-class medicine that blocks the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial cytokine that plays a key role across the spectrum of asthma inflammation.1,2 Tezepelumab is being developed by AstraZeneca in collaboration with Amgen.

Severe asthma
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease affecting an estimated 339 million people worldwide.3,4 Approximately 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma,4,5 which may be uncontrolled despite high doses of SoC asthma controller medicines and currently available biologic medicines. Some of these patients may require the use of long-term OCS4-6 which can lead to serious short- and long-term adverse effects.7-9 Severe, uncontrolled asthma is debilitating and potentially fatal, with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations and significant limitations on lung function and health-related quality of life.4,6,10 Due to the complexity of severe asthma, many patients have unclear or multiple drivers of inflammation and may not qualify for or respond well to a current biologic medicine.5,11,12

PATHFINDER clinical trial programme
Building on the positive PATHWAY Phase IIb trial, the PATHFINDER Phase III programme includes the registrational NAVIGATOR trial and the supportive SOURCE trial.2,13-16 The programme includes additional planned mechanistic and long-term safety trials.

SOURCE is a Phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial for 48 weeks in 150 adult patients with severe asthma who require continuous treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), and chronic treatment with maintenance OCS therapy.14,16 In the trial, patients were randomised to receive tezepelumab 210mg every four weeks or placebo as add-on therapy, with patients maintained on their currently prescribed ICS plus LABA, with or without other asthma controller therapy.14,16

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage reduction from baseline in the prescribed daily OCS maintenance dose at 48 weeks while not losing asthma control. Secondary endpoints included the effect of tezepelumab on AAER, lung function, asthma control, quality of life, work productivity and activity impairment.14,16

NAVIGATOR is a Phase III, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 1,061 adults (18–80 years old) and adolescents (12–17 years old) with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were receiving treatment with medium- or high-dose ICS plus at least one additional controller medicine with or without oral corticosteroids. NAVIGATOR met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to SoC demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the AAER over 52 weeks in the overall patient population, compared to placebo added to SoC. The trial also met the primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 300 cells per microlitre, with tezepelumab demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in AAER in that patient population. Similar reductions in AAER were observed in the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 150 cells per microlitre.13,15,17

Patients who participated in the NAVIGATOR and SOURCE trials were eligible to continue in DESTINATION, a Phase III extension trial assessing long-term safety and efficacy.18

Tezepelumab
Tezepelumab is a potential first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of TSLP, a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and is critical in the initiation and persistence of allergic, eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma.1,2 TSLP is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations, including allergens, viruses and other airborne particles.1,2 Expression of TSLP is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity.2,19 Blocking TSLP may prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control.2,19 Tezepelumab acts at the top of the inflammation cascade and has the potential to treat a broad population of severe asthma patients regardless of their type of inflammation.2,19

AstraZeneca and Amgen collaboration
Earlier in 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated the 2012 collaboration agreement for tezepelumab. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single digit inventor royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca continues to lead development and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies. Under the amended agreement in North America, Amgen and AstraZeneca will jointly commercialise tezepelumab; Amgen will record sales in the US and AstraZeneca will record sales in Canada. AstraZeneca’s share of gross profits from tezepelumab in the US will be recognised as collaboration revenue. In all countries outside the US and Canada, AstraZeneca will solely commercialise tezepelumab. AstraZeneca will record all sales outside of the US as product sales and recognise Amgen’s share of gross profit as cost of sales.

AstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology
Respiratory & Immunology is one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key future growth driver for the Company.

AstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care, and its inhaled and biologic medicines reached more than 53 million patients in 2019. Building on a 50-year heritage, the Company aims to transform the treatment of asthma and COPD by focusing on earlier biology-led treatment, eliminating preventable asthma attacks, and removing COPD as a top-three leading cause of death. The Company’s early respiratory research is focused on emerging science involving immune mechanisms, lung damage and abnormal cell-repair processes in disease and neuronal dysfunction.

With common pathways and underlying disease drivers across respiratory and immunology, AstraZeneca is following the science from chronic lung diseases to immunology-driven disease areas. The Company’s growing presence in immunology is focused on five mid- to late-stage franchises with multi-disease potential, in areas including rheumatology (including systemic lupus erythematosus), dermatology, gastroenterology, and systemic eosinophilic-driven diseases. AstraZeneca’s ambition in Respiratory & Immunology is to achieve disease modification and durable remission for millions of patients worldwide.

The subcutaneous formulation was approved by Health Canada to treat patients with multiple myeloma in 2020","TORONTO, Dec 22, 2020 /CNW/ – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announce that Health Canada has approved DARZALEX® (daratumumab) in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).1 This represents the first Canadian approval of a biologic for newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for a stem cell transplant and it is the fifth approval for DARZALEX®.

The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 CASSIOPEIA (MMY3006) study that demonstrated the addition of DARZALEX® to VTd before and after ASCT resulted in deeper responses, as indicated by the higher stringent complete response (sCR) rate, and improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to VTd alone.2

“This important Phase 3 clinical study is robust in terms of design, number of participating patients and efficacy results,” said Dr. Richard LeBlanc, hematologist and Myeloma Canada Chair on multiple myeloma at Université de Montréal. “This study evaluated the impact of adding daratumumab before and after autologous stem cell transplantation in first line treatment and showed that the addition of daratumumab significantly reduces the risk of progression from multiple myeloma and death.”

Data from the study were first presented at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in The Lancet.10

Results showed that the primary endpoint of sCR rate post-transplant was significantly higher in the DARZALEX®-VTd arm compared to VTd alone (29 per cent vs. 20 per cent; p-value=0.0010).3 The addition of DARZALEX® to VTd at a median follow-up of 18.8 months resulted in a 53 per cent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to VTd alone
(Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.47; 95 per cent CI, 0.33–0.67; P<0.0001).4

“The DARZALEX clinical development program has led to many important firsts, but more importantly, it has generated key insights and understanding into the biology and treatment of multiple myeloma,” said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “This milestone marks the first approval of a biologic in Canada for newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible patients and it is the fifth Canadian approval for DARZALEX®. Yet our work is far from over, as we are committed to discovering and developing innovative treatments like DARZALEX® for the benefit of patients facing a multiple myeloma diagnosis.”

About the CASSIOPEIA Study
This randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study is sponsored by the French Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM) in collaboration with the Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology (HOVON) and Janssen Research & Development, LLC.5

The study included 1,085 newly diagnosed patients with previously untreated, symptomatic multiple myeloma who were eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant (median age is 58).6 In the first part of the study, patients were randomized to receive induction treatment with VTd alone or in combination with DARZALEX®, high-dose therapy and ASCT, and consolidation therapy with VTd alone or in combination with DARZALEX®.7 The primary endpoint in this part of the study is the proportion of patients who achieve a sCR at the end of consolidation therapy.8

The most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events (≥20 per cent) in the DVTd arm were: infusion-related reactions, peripheral sensory neuropathy, constipation, asthenia, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, peripheral edema, neutropenia, pyrexia, paraesthesia, and thrombocytopenia. Serious adverse events with a 2 per cent higher incidence in the DVTd arm compared to the VTd arm included neutropenia (DVTd 3.9 per cent vs. VTd 1.5 per cent) and pneumonia (DVTd 3.5 per cent vs. VTd 1.7 per cent).9

In the second part of the study, which is ongoing, patients who achieved a partial response or better in part one underwent a second randomization to receive maintenance treatment with DARZALEX® 16 mg/kg every eight weeks for up to two years or be observed with no further treatment. The primary endpoint in the second part of the study is PFS. 10

About DARZALEX® 
DARZALEX® is the first CD38-directed monoclonal antibody approved to treat multiple myeloma. In 2020, the subcutaneous formulation, DARZALEX® SC, was approved by Health Canada to treat patients with multiple myeloma.11

DARZALEX® binds to CD38, a surface protein highly expressed across multiple myeloma cells.12 DARZALEX® induces tumor cell death through cell lysis via multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).13 DARZALEX® has also demonstrated immunomodulatory effects such as increasing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells counts, which may contribute to clinical response.14

In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize DARZALEX®. Janssen Inc. commercializes DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC in Canada. For full Prescribing Information and more information about DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC, please visit www.janssen.com/canada. 

About Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.15 When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow. In 2020, it is estimated that 3,400 Canadians will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma and there will be 1,600 deaths associated with the disease.16 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms in the early stages, patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone disease or pain, anemia, calcium elevation, and kidney problems.17

 NBIb-1817 is an investigational recombinant AAV serotype 2 vectors encoding the gene for human AADC help to produce AADC enzyme in brain cells & convert levodopa to dopamine","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: VYGR) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has notified Neurocrine Biosciences (Nasdaq: NBIX) that it has placed a clinical hold on the RESTORE-1 clinical trial of NBIb-1817 (VY-AADC). As previously announced, trial sites participating in RESTORE-1 had not been screening, enrolling or dosing patients as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently, as a result of the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)’s request to pause dosing pending its review of additional data. The DSMB has requested additional patient level data from the trial and now plans to review these data in early 2021. The clinical hold follows the submission by Neurocrine Biosciences of an IND Safety Report related to the observation of MRI abnormalities in some RESTORE-1 study participants. The clinical implications of this observation are currently unknown and are being evaluated.

RESTORE-1 is a Phase 2 clinical trial of NBIb-1817 (VY-AADC), an intracerebral AAV-based investigational gene therapy, in development for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The RESTORE-1 DSMB has been informed of the clinical hold, as have the study investigators and central and local ethics committees. Neurocrine Biosciences and Voyager will work closely with the FDA and the DSMB to determine the next steps for the RESTORE-1 clinical trial.

About Parkinson’s Disease and NBIb-1817 (VY-AADC)
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive, and debilitating neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately one million people in the U.S. and ten million people worldwide. It is characterized by a loss of dopamine and neuronal degeneration with a concomitant loss of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme required to synthesize dopamine in the brain, leading to associated impairment in motor, neuropsychiatric, and autonomic functions. Dopamine is a chemical “messenger” that is produced in the brain and is involved in the control of movement. It is made when AADC converts the chemical levodopa to dopamine. As Parkinson’s disease progresses, there is less AADC enzyme in parts of the brain where levodopa is converted to dopamine.

NBIb-1817 (VY-AADC) is an investigational recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) serotype 2 vector encoding the gene for human AADC that is designed to help produce the AADC enzyme in brain cells where it can convert levodopa to dopamine. NBIb-1817 (VY-AADC) is administered into the brain using intraoperative monitoring with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-facilitated targeted delivery.

 The FDA granted BTD for cilta-cel and agreed to BLA’s rolling review includes completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed on an ongoing basis and the data were presented at the 62nd (ASH) Annual Meeting
 Cilta-cel is a unique, structurally differentiated CAR-T cell therapy containing a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain and 2 BCMA-targeting single-domain antibodies with a preferential CD8+ T-cell expansion","December 21, 2020 (RARITAN, N.J.) – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today the initiation of a rolling submission of its Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel), an investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, for the treatment of adults with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.

“We are committed to innovation in cell therapy and advancing the science of multiple myeloma to improve patients’ lives,” said Peter Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Today’s milestone is the culmination of a remarkable clinical development effort and collaboration with Legend Biotech. We look forward to working with the FDA in their review of cilta-cel with the goal of bringing a highly-active, dual-binding BCMA CAR-T therapy to patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who are in need of new treatment options.”

The FDA previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for cilta-cel and has agreed to a rolling review of the BLA in which completed portions of the application will be submitted and reviewed on an ongoing basis. Data for cilta-cel were recently presented (Abstract #177) at the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.

“Our immuno-oncology capabilities combined with our dedicated Janssen R&D team, who continue to work in close collaboration with Legend Biotech, have enabled the expeditious investigational advancement of cilta-cel,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. “Today’s submission marks Janssen’s first cell therapy application, but more importantly, brings cilta-cel one step closer to our goal of making new medical options available to patients with multiple myeloma.”

About CARTITUDE-1
CARTITUDE-1 (NCT03548207) is an ongoing Phase 1b/2, open-label, multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of cilta-cel in adults with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma,
99 percent of whom were refractory to the last line of treatment and 88 percent of whom were
triple-class refractory, meaning their cancer did not respond, or no longer responds, to an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an anti-CD38 antibody.

The primary objective of the Phase 1b portion of the study was to characterize the safety and confirm the dose of cilta-cel, informed by the first-in-human study with LCAR-B38M CAR-T cells (LEGEND-2). Based on the safety profile observed in this portion of the CARTITUDE-1 study, the Phase 2 portion further evaluated the efficacy of cilta-cel at the recommended Phase 2 dose with overall response as the primary endpoint.

About ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel)
Cilta-cel is an investigational CAR-T therapy being studied in a comprehensive clinical development program for the treatment of patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma and in earlier lines of treatment. Cilta-cel is a unique, structurally differentiated CAR-T cell therapy containing a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain and two BCMA-targeting single-domain antibodies with a preferential CD8+ T-cell expansion. BCMA is a protein that is highly expressed on myeloma cells.[1] CAR-T cells are an innovative approach to eradicating cancer cells by harnessing the power of a patient’s own immune system. The safety profile observed to date for cilta-cel supports the potential for outpatient dosing, which will be evaluated in ongoing clinical studies.

In December 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Legend Biotech USA Inc. to develop and commercialize cilta-cel.

In addition to a U.S. BTD granted in December 2019, cilta-cel received a PRIority MEdicines (PRiME) designation from the European Commission in April 2019, and a BTD in China in August 2020. Janssen also received Orphan Drug Designation for cilta-cel from the FDA in February 2019 and from the European Commission in February 2020.

53912,Ocular Therapeutix Reports sNDA Submission of Dextenza (dexamethasone ophthalmic insert) to the US FDA for Ocular Itching,OCULAR THERAPEUTIX™ ANNOUNCES SUBMISSION TO THE FDA OF A SUPPLEMENTAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION FOR DEXTENZA® (DEXAMETHASONE OPHTHALMIC INSERT) FOR THE TREATMENT OF OCULAR ITCHING ASSOCIATED WITH ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS,"The sNDA submission is based on P-II/P-III Clinical trial assessing Dextenza(dexamethasone ophthalmic insert, 0.4mg) vs PBO for the treatment of Ocular Itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis
 Result: At 1EPs for the pooled analysis of P-III clinical trial at Day 8; ocular itching favored DEXTENZA treated participants compared with PBO at all 3-time points: 3 min (1.85 vs 2.55), 5 min (1.90 vs 2.63), and 7 min (1.84 vs 2.61)
 Dextenza is a corticosteroid intracanalicular insert placed in the punctum, a natural opening in the inner portion of the lower eyelid, and into the canaliculus and is designed to deliver dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to 30 days without preservatives","BEDFORD, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Dec. 22, 2020– Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCUL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the formulation, development, and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced the submission of the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for DEXTENZA® (dexamethasone ophthalmic insert) 0.4 mg for intracanalicular use. If approved, this sNDA would include the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis as an additional approved indication of DEXTENZA.

“We are excited to share the allergic conjunctivitis data with the FDA and feel this sNDA supports an expanded label. If approved, the sNDA would reflect the second expansion of the DEXTENZA label and would include the first indication for DEXTENZA treated primarily in the ophthalmology office setting,” said Antony Mattessich, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ocular Therapeutix. “It is estimated that up to 10 million1,2,3 people in the U.S. annually seek medical attention for the inflammatory response associated with allergic conjunctivitis caused by both seasonal and perennial allergens, representing a discrete and significant potential market for DEXTENZA beyond its current use in the surgical setting. From a business perspective, ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis is our first potential indication in the treatment of an ocular surface disease, paving the way for our two Phase 2 clinical programs in the treatment of dry-eye disease.”

The efficacy of DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular itching was evaluated in four vehicle-controlled clinical trials for subjects with a positive history of ocular allergies and positive skin test reaction to perennial and seasonal allergens (n=323). The sNDA offers data that Ocular believes supports that DEXTENZA demonstrated superiority to placebo vehicle for the treatment of ocular itching due to allergic conjunctivitis as evidenced by statistically significant differences in a pooled analysis of three well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials as well as in the Phase 2 clinical trial. At the primary endpoint for the pooled analysis of the three Phase 3 clinical trials (Day 8), ocular itching scores favored DEXTENZA treated subjects compared with placebo vehicle treated subjects at all three timepoints: 3 min (1.85 vs 2.55, p value = <0.0001 ), 5 min (1.90 vs 2.63, p value = <0.0001 ) and 7 min (1.84 vs 2.61, p value = <0.0001 ). In addition, it is submitted that treatment with DEXTENZA consistently resulted in lower ocular mean itching scores relative to placebo vehicle at all other study visits throughout the duration of the respective studies.

DEXTENZA was observed to have a favorable safety profile and be generally well-tolerated in the allergic conjunctivitis, ocular inflammation and pain clinical program populations. The most common ocular adverse events seen in the pooled analysis of the allergic conjunctivitis studies were: increased intraocular pressure (n=6), increased lacrimation (n=2), eye discharge (n=2) and reduced visual acuity (n=2). The most common non-ocular adverse events seen were: headache (n=2), nasopharyngitis (n=1), gastroenteritis viral (n=1), dermatitis contact (n=1), and oropharyngeal pain (n=1).

“The use of topical steroids is an important part of the clinical armamentarium in the treatment of a patient with allergic conjunctivitis,” said Michael Goldstein, MD, MBA, Chief Medical Officer of Ocular Therapeutix. “As DEXTENZA is physician-administered and can’t be overused by patients, it provides a potentially safer method of steroid delivery. In addition, unlike current therapeutic options, DEXTENZA is a preservative-free steroid which may be a benefit for patients with allergic conjunctivitis who already have a compromised ocular surface.“

The Company has received acceptance of the sNDA submission to the FDA and anticipates a target action data under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, commonly known as PDUFA, in October of 2021.

About DEXTENZA

DEXTENZA is FDA approved for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery. DEXTENZA is a corticosteroid intracanalicular insert placed in the punctum, a natural opening in the inner portion of the lower eyelid, and into the canaliculus and is designed to deliver dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to 30 days without preservatives. DEXTENZA resorbs and exits the nasolacrimal system without the need for removal.

The safety of DEXTENZA was assessed in three Phase 3 clinical trials and a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical inflammation and pain of the eye prior to its approval. Overall, 567 subjects were exposed to DEXTENZA in such clinical trials. The most common ocular adverse reactions in subjects treated with DEXTENZA were: anterior chamber inflammation including iritis and iridocyclitis (10%), increased intraocular pressure (6%), reduced visual acuity (2%), cystoid macular edema (1%), corneal edema (1%), eye pain (1%), and conjunctival hyperemia (1%). The most common non-ocular adverse event was headache (1%).

53918,AMO Pharma Initiates P-II REACH-CDM study of AMO-02 (tideglusib) to treat Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy,AMO Pharma Announces Initiation of Pivotal REACH-CDM Clinical Trial for AMO-02 in Treatment of Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy,"The P-II REACH-CDM evaluate the efficacy and safety of AMO-02 (tideglusib) in 56 patients to treat congenital Myotonic Dystrophy in the U.S and Canada with additional sites in Australia, New Zealand, and other countries to be added seeking local approvals
 The REACH-CDM study was designed on the basis of positive P-II data results which were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Pediatric Neurology.
 AMO-02 is a clinical-stage investigation medicine & in development for the treatment of congenital myotonic dystrophy and has potential use in CNS, neuromuscular and other orphan indications","LONDON, Dec. 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AMO Pharma Limited (“AMO Pharma”), a privately held biopharmaceutical company focusing on rare, childhood onset neurogenetic disorders with limited or no treatment options, today announced the initiation of REACH-CDM, a pivotal clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of AMO-02, the company’s dual action investigational mRNA modulating/GSK3ß kinase inhibitor, in the treatment of congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM1).

Initiation of the study follows the successful completion of discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding amendments to the clinical trial protocol to address potential issues associated with execution of the study presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and approval by Health Canada of the revised study protocol. These discussions occurred in addition to a recent end of Phase 2 meeting conducted with FDA, and the FDA decision to grant Rare Pediatric Disease designation to AMO-02 for the treatment of CDM1.

“COVID-19 has caused disruption in clinical research for almost every drug developer around the world. Based on our experience with clinical studies in pediatric neurological disorders, we were able to outline a path forward that both optimizes safety for participants in the REACH-CDM study and positions us to provide regulators with a clear and unambiguous assessment of outcomes,” said Dr. Joseph Horrigan, AMO Pharma chief medical officer. “We are grateful that FDA has agreed to our approach of using telehealth as a strategy to manage the potential impact of COVID-19 on the progression of this important study.”

Dr. Aravindhan Veerapandiyan, of Arkansas Children’s Hospital, said, “We are extremely excited to start enrolling patients for REACH-CDM, a pivotal therapeutic trial in the space of congenital myotonic dystrophy. The unique aspects of this research trial that interest me are utilization of telehealth as well as the primary outcome measure used to assess the treatment response. I am hopeful that this investigational product can be a life changer for patients living with this ultra-rare severe muscular dystrophy and their families.”

The REACH-CDM study was designed based on the results of positive Phase 2 data that were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Pediatric Neurology. In prior research, AMO-02 has been shown to access brain, muscle and other tissues and reduce the effect of DMPK expansion repeat in mRNA that is the pathological basis for congenital myotonic dystrophy. REACH-CDM is a double-blind placebo controlled randomized study in children and adolescents with congenital onset myotonic dystrophy intended to support a future submission for marketing authorization in congenital myotonic dystrophy. The trial will seek to enroll a total of 56 patients initially at sites in the U.S. and Canada, with additional sites in Australia, New Zealand and other countries to be added pending local approvals. AMO Pharma will issue further updates from Q1 of next year. Patients will be assessed on a range of measures of CNS features and muscle function associated with CDM1, using a primary outcome measure agreed to by the FDA.

“Congenital myotonic dystrophy is a devastating disease that has a profound impact on the health and quality of life of patients and families. We are very encouraged by the levels of interest in the REACH-CDM trial from investigators and researchers and from families who are so anxious for a treatment,” said Ibs Mahmood, AMO Pharma CEO, adding, “We are dedicated to advancing the development program for AMO-02 as rapidly as possible and are grateful to the regulators, investigators and leaders in patient advocacy for their support.”

Additional information about the REACH-CDM trial is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov.

About AMO-02

AMO-02 (tideglusib) is in development for the treatment of congenital myotonic dystrophy and has potential for use in additional CNS, neuromuscular and other orphan indications. AM0-02 is a clinical stage investigational medicine for the treatment of the severe form of congenital myotonic dystrophy known as DM1 or Steinert disease. In cellular and animal models of DM1 as well as in muscle biopsies from patients, activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3ß) has been shown to increase. AMO-02 is an inhibitor that has been shown to normalise levels of GSK3ß in transgenic models and in ex vivo tissue samples in patients with DM1 and to reduce levels of the mRNA that is pathogenic for DM1.

About AMO Pharma

AMO Pharma is a biopharmaceutical company working to identify and advance promising therapies for the treatment of serious and debilitating diseases in patient populations with significant areas of unmet need, including rare and severe childhood onset neurogenetic disorders with limited or no treatment options. In addition to developing AMO-02 for congenital myotonic dystrophy, the company is also progressing AMO-01 as a clinical stage treatment for Phelan-McDermid syndrome and AMO-04 as a clinic-ready potential medicine for Rett syndrome and related disorders.

53923,Roche's Phesgo (Perjeta + Herceptin) Receives EC's Approval for the Treatment of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer,European Commission approves Roche’s Phesgo (fixed-dose combination of Perjeta and Herceptin for subcutaneous injection) for people with HER2-positive breast cancer,"The approval is based on P-III FeDeriCa study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of Phesgo + CT vs Perjeta + Herceptin (IV) + CT in 500 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) and adjuvant (after surgery)
 Result of FeDeriCa Study: The GMR for the 1EPs (1.22) with the lower limit (90%) CI of the GMR (1.14≥0.80). 2EPs of non-inferior levels of Herceptin was also met with blood conc. GMR (1.33) with the lower limit (90%)
 Phesgo combines the same mAb as Perjeta and Herceptin with Halozyme Therapeutics Enhanze drug delivery technology in a novel formulation for SC use","Basel, 23 December 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has approved Phesgo®, a fixed-dose combination of Perjeta® (pertuzumab) and Herceptin® (trastuzumab) with hyaluronidase, administered by subcutaneous (SC; under the skin) injection for the treatment of early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.

“This approval represents a significant step forward in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “The innovation of Phesgo significantly reduces the time people spend receiving standard of care therapy with Perjeta and Herceptin, helping to minimise the impact of treatment on their everyday lives. It also addresses the increasing demand across healthcare systems for faster and more flexible treatment solutions.”

Phesgo is available as a single-dose vial for SC injection and enables over 90% faster treatment than IV administration of standard of care therapy with Perjeta and Herceptin. SC administration of Phesgo takes approximately eight minutes for the initial loading dose and approximately five minutes for each subsequent maintenance dose. This is compared to approximately 150 minutes for infusion of a loading dose of Perjeta and Herceptin using the standard IV formulations, and between 60-150 minutes for subsequent maintenance infusions of the two medicines.4,5,6

The approval of Phesgo in Europe is based on results from the pivotal phase III FeDeriCa study, which showed that treatment with Phesgo produced non-inferior levels of Perjeta and Herceptin in the blood and demonstrated comparable efficacy versus IV administration of the two medicines. The safety profile of Phesgo with chemotherapy was comparable to IV administration of Perjeta plus Herceptin and chemotherapy. No new safety signals were identified, including no meaningful difference in cardiac toxicity.7

The development of Phesgo highlights Roche’s commitment to improving patients’ experience of cancer treatment, looking beyond efficacy outcomes and focusing on more flexible treatment solutions. Phesgo has the potential to help minimise pressure on healthcare systems by reducing administration time, as well as other costs associated with treatment, such as time spent in the infusion chair and drug preparation.8,9 The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need to utilise novel approaches that help to manage healthcare capacity to free-up time and resources.

About the FeDeriCa study7,10
FeDeriCa is an international, multi-centre, two-arm, randomised, open-label, pivotal phase III study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injection of Phesgo in combination with chemotherapy, compared with standard intravenous (IV) infusions of Perjeta and Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy, in 500 people with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) and adjuvant (after surgery) settings. The primary endpoint of the study is minimum levels of Perjeta in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough), when compared to IV administration of Perjeta. Secondary endpoints include safety; minimum levels of Herceptin in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough); and total pathological complete response, meaning there is no tumour tissue detectable in the tissue removed at the time of surgery.

Data from the FeDeriCa study were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2019. The FeDeriCa study met its primary endpoint of non-inferior levels of Perjeta in the blood. The geometric mean ratio (GMR; a type of average used when assessing pharmacokinetics) for the primary endpoint was 1.22 (90% CI: 1.14 to 1.31), with the lower limit of the 90% CI of the GMR=1.14≥0.80 (the pre-specified non-inferiority margin). A secondary endpoint of non-inferior levels of Herceptin was also met, with blood concentrations for people receiving Phesgo non-inferior to those receiving IV Herceptin (GMR=1.33 [90% CI: 1.24 to 1.43]; lower limit of 90% CI of GMR=1.24≥0.80). A non-inferiority endpoint was chosen for the study to ensure that people were receiving sufficient dosing with Perjeta and Herceptin as compared to the established IV doses at the same treatment intervals.

About Phesgo
Phesgo combines the same monoclonal antibodies as Perjeta and Herceptin with Halozyme Therapeutics’ Enhanze® drug delivery technology in a novel formulation for subcutaneous (SC) use.4,11 This is the first time that Roche has combined two monoclonal antibodies that can be administered by a single SC injection.

Halozyme’s Enhanze drug delivery technology may enable and optimise SC drug delivery for appropriate co-administered therapeutics. The technology is based on a proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), an enzyme that temporarily degrades hyaluronan – a glycosaminoglycan or chain of natural sugars in the body – to aid in the dispersion and absorption of other injected therapeutic drugs.11

Pertuzumab in Phesgo is the same monoclonal antibody as in intravenous (IV) Perjeta, and trastuzumab in Phesgo is the same monoclonal antibody as in IV Herceptin. The mechanisms of action of Perjeta and Herceptin are believed to complement each other as both bind to the HER2 receptor, but in different locations. The combination of Perjeta and Herceptin is thought to provide a more comprehensive, dual blockade of the HER signalling pathways.12,13

Phesgo is approved in the US for the treatment of early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. The approved indications for Phesgo mirror those of Perjeta.

The standard IV formulation of Perjeta in combination with IV Herceptin and chemotherapy (the Perjeta-based regimen) is approved in more than 100 countries for the treatment of both early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In the neoadjuvant (before surgery) early breast cancer (eBC) setting, the Perjeta-based regimen has been shown to almost double the rate of pathological complete response compared to Herceptin and chemotherapy.14 Additionally, the combination has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence of invasive disease or death in the adjuvant (after surgery) eBC setting.15 In the metastatic setting, the combination has shown an unprecedented survival benefit in previously untreated (first-line) patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.16

About Roche’s medicines for HER2-positive breast cancer
Roche has been leading research into the HER2 pathway for more than 30 years and is committed to improving the health, quality of life and survival of people with both early and metastatic HER2-positive disease. HER2-positive breast cancer is a particularly aggressive form of the disease that affects approximately 25-30% of patients.17 Roche has developed three innovative medicines that have helped transform the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer: Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla® (trastuzumab emtansine). Eligibility for treatment with Roche’s HER2-targeted medicines is determined via a diagnostic test which identifies people who will likely benefit from these medicines at the onset of their disease.

53962,Innovent's Sulinno (Adalimumab biosimilar) Receives China's NMPA Approval for Pediatric Plaque Psoriasis and Non-infectious Uveitis,Innovent Announces NMPA Granted New Indication Approvals for SULINNO® (Adalimumab Injection) for the Treatment of Pediatric Plaque Psoriasis and Non-infectious Uveitis,"The approval is granted in pediatric plaque psoriasis and non-infectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis and panuveitis in adults, who do not respond adequately to corticosteroids.
 These are fifth and sixth approved indications of Sulinno in China and it was first approved by NMPA on Sep 2, 2020
 Sulinno is an adalimumab biosimilar which is a recombinant human anti-TNF-α mAB developed by Innovent and are indicated in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.","SAN FRANCISCO, U.S. and SUZHOU, China, December 22, 2020 — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announces that SULINNO® (adalimumab injection), a recombinant human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody drug, has been officially approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China for two new indications, including the treatment of pediatric plaque psoriasis and non-infectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis and panuveitis in adults who do not respond adequately to corticosteroids, require restraint of corticosteroids, or are not suitable for corticosteroid therapies. These are the fifth and sixth approved indications of SULINNO® in China. SULINNO® was firstly approved by China NMPA on September 2, 2020. Previous approved indications of SULINNO® include rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Since the launch of adalimumab, it has been approved worldwide for the treatment of seventeen diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriasis arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Crohn’s disease (including pediatric Crohn’s disease), ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, etc. The efficacy and safety of adalimumab has been well recognized globally, and adalimumab injection is widely used in the North America and Europe. It has been consistently recommended in multiple diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of these diseases, and its significant efficacy has been universally recognized. SULINNO® is adalimumab biosimilar developed by Innovent, and its clinical results were published in the Inaugural Issue of The Lancet Rheumatology in 2019. The launch of SULINNO® has provided more Chinese patients with high-quality and relatively affordable adalimumab injection, bringing hope and opportunities to more patients.

Dr. Qian Lei, Senior Director of Medical Sciences and Strategies of Special Diseases of Innovent, stated, “There remains huge unmet medical need for the treatment of psoriasis and uveitis in China. Psoriasis can bring tremendous pain and physiological burden that seriously affect patients’ quality of life and mental health. Psoriasis in children is a particular challenge. However, early diagnosis and adequate management will have the opportunity to avoid complications that may result from chronic inflammation in adulthood. Uveitis can cause severe eye discomfort and directly affect vision. Meanwhile, patients with uveitis are at high risk for ocular complications, including glaucoma, macular edema, and cataracts, and recurrent episodes may result in cumulative ocular damage, increasing the risk of visual impairment or blindness. Up to 35% of patients with uveitis may have impaired vision, imposing a heavy economic burden on patients and society. Early diagnosis and standardization of effective treatment are important to maintain visual acuity. We hope the approval of SULINNO® for new indications will provide psoriasis and uveitis patients with a high quality, effective and more affordable treatment option.”

About Psoriasis and Pediatric Plaque Psoriasis

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 2% of the population worldwide. The skin disorder begins in childhood in about one-third of the cases. The prevalence of psoriasis in the population aged 0-19 is about 0.18% in China. Thus it is estimated that psoriasis affects about 600,000 children in China. The most common type of psoriasis in children is chronic plaque psoriasis (74%), followed by guttate psoriasis (14%), seborrheic dermatitis-like psoriasis (8%), and the least common is pustular psoriasis (1%). The treatment of plaque psoriasis in children is complex and difficult due to the lack of adequate clinical data, effective systemic therapy, and standardized treatment guidelines. Psoriasis not only brings serious psychosocial burden to children, but also may increase the risk of complications such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Thus, timely and effective treatment is particularly important. Adalimumab injection was approved by FDA for the treatment of psoriasis (including pediatric plaque psoriasis), and is widely used in the North America and Europe for this disease.

About Uveitis and Non-infectious Uveitis 

Uveitis is a group of ocular diseases characterized by inflammation of the uveal tract and neighboring structures. Uveitis is mainly grouped into infectious uveitis and non-infectious uveitis, in which non-infectious uveitis accounts for about 20% to 40% of uveitis cases. The prevalence of uveitis in China is 152 / 100,000, of which the prevalence of non-infectious uveitis is 62.6-83.3/100,000. Thus it is estimated that there are about 800,000-1,150,000 patients with non-infectious uveitis in China. Non-infectious uveitis is an ocular immune disorder caused by an inappropriate inflammatory response of the immune system to antigens in the uveal tract and retina, some of which may be associated with systemic autoimmune diseases, but some may affect the eyes only. Since uveitis typically affects the working age group (20-60 years old), not only does it affect patients’ quality of life, but also has profound socioeconomic impact on the affected patients. Topical corticosteroid eye drops can be used for non-infectious anterior uveitis, but non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis often requires long-term topical or even systemic corticosteroids or other immunomodulators. Some patients do not respond well to corticosteroid therapy, and the side effects of corticosteroids limit their long-term use. Adalimumab injection was approved by FDA on June 30, 2016 for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis. In 2018, international committee on uveitis issued a guideline on nonsteroidal systemic immunomodulatory treatment in uveitis, which made detailed recommendations on the use of TNF-α monoclonal antibody, represented by adalimumab, in non-infectious uveitis.

About SULINNO®

SULINNO® is an adalimumab (Humira®) biosimilar and a recombinant human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody independently developed by Innovent. TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine mainly produced by activated macrophages, natural killer cells and T lymphocytes, which is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Anti-TNF-α antibody can bind to human TNF-α monomer or trimer, block TNF-α binding to the cellular surface receptor, p55 and p75, and neutralize the cytotoxic effect of TNF-α, thereby inhibiting the release of TNF-α mediated inflammatory factors and cytokines, the adhesion and infiltration of inflammatory cells, the proliferation of fibroblasts and the activation of osteoclasts.

The results of a complete pre-clinical comparison showed that SULINNO® has similar in vitro biological activity (binding activity to target antigen TNF-α and neutralizing activity), physicochemical property and pharmacokinetic characteristics to those of Humira®. The similarities were also demonstrated in pharmacological and toxicological studies. The head-to-head clinical study comparing SULINNO® and Humira® conducted in patients with ankylosing spondylitis demonstrated a clinical similarity. The study results were published at Inaugural Issue of The Lancet Rheumatology in 2019.

 The launch of Byvasda has provided Chinese patients with high quality and relatively more affordable bevacizumab biosimilar injection
 Byvasda is a bevacizumab biosimilar and a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug. Byvasda has been approved in China for the treatment of NSCLC and mCRC","SAN FRANCISCO, U.S. and SUZHOU, China, December 28, 2020 — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announces that BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar), a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug independently developed by Innovent, has been officially approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China for the treatment of adult recurrent glioblastoma （GBM, the most common malignant primary brain tumor）, which is the third approved indication of BYVASDA® in China.

BYVASDA® was firstly approved by China NMPA on June 17, 2020. Previous approved indications of BYVASDA® include advanced non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer.

In recent years, the cancer burden in China has been continuously increasing. According to the report of Cancer Today from the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Cancer Research, there were 4.285 million newly diagnosed cancer patients and 2.865 million deaths from cancer in China in 2018. Among the malignant tumors, glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive type of primary malignant brain tumor in adults, characterized by high morbidity, high recurrence rate, high mortality rate and low cure rate. Current major treatment regimens for glioblastoma include surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The median survival time is only 12 to 15 months which have no significant change over the past decade. Therefore, more new therapeutic methods are urgently needed in glioblastoma patients.

Since the launch of bevacizumab, it has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, and in China it was approved for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer and adult recurrent glioblastoma. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab have been well recognized worldwide. However, there still remains huge unmet clinical demand for bevacizumab treatment in China, as many ordinary Chinese patients cannot afford for original drugs. BYVASDA® is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) humanized monoclonal antibody and a bevacizumab biosimilar independently developed by Innovent. The launch of BYVASDA® has provided Chinese patients with high quality and relatively more affordable bevacizumab biosimilar injection.

Dr. Hui Zhou, Vice President of Oncology Strategy and Medical Sciences of Innovent, stated: Glioblastoma is the third approved indication of BYVASDA® in China following advanced non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. The prognosis of glioblastoma patients is still poor even after standard postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Almost all patients will relapse after first-line treatment, with low five-year survival rate. We hope to bring this high-quality and cost-saving drug to more patients in need in China. In January 2020, Innovent out-licensed the commercial rights of BYVASDA® in the United States and Canada to Coherus BioSciences, a leading biosimilar company, demonstrated an international recognition of the quality of BYVASDA®. We are looking forward to working together to make BYVASDA® benefit more patients globally.”

About Recurrent Glioblastoma 

Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, representing approximately 57% of all gliomas and 48% of all primary malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors, with an incidence of 3.2 per 100,000 populations. The current standard treatment regimen for primary glioblastoma includes a combination of surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Due to the aggressive nature, almost all glioblastomas recur after initial therapy. In 2009, Bevacizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for recurrent glioblastoma.

About BYVASDA® 

BYVASDA® is a bevacizumab biosimilar and a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important factor in angiogenesis that is highly expressed by the endothelial cells in most human tumors. An anti-VEGF antibody binds VEGF selectively with high affinity and blocks its binding to VEGF receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt/PKB and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK. BYVASDA® produces anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the growth, proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, blocking angiogenesis, reducing vascular permeability, blocking blood supply to tumor tissues, inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Since the launch of bevacizumab, it has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab have been well recognized worldwide.

53987,Amyrt's AP103 Receives the US FDA's Orphan Drug designation for Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB),Amryt Granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for AP103,"The US FDA has granted orphan drug designation for AP103 for the treatment of DEB
 Amyrt licensed a pre-clinical gene – therapy platform technology to treat patients with DEB, a subset of EB also applicable for genetic disorders in Mar 2018
 AP103 is based on a novel polymer-based topical delivery platform and offers potential advantages in the gene therapy field also used in other genetic skin conditions","DUBLIN, Ireland, and Boston MA, December 23, 2020, Amryt (Nasdaq: AMYT, AIM: AMYT), a global, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing novel therapeutics to treat patients suffering from serious and life-threatening rare diseases, is pleased to announce today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted orphan drug designation for AP103 for the treatment of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (“DEB”). AP103 is based on Amryt’s gene-therapy platform technology and offers a potential treatment for patients with DEB, a subset of EB.
The FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development (“OOPD”) grants orphan drug designation to support the development of medicines for rare diseases, that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug designation may allow Amryt to be eligible for a seven-year period of U.S. Marketing exclusivity upon approval of AP103 and a waiver of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) filing fees, subject to certain conditions.

AP103 is based on a new gene therapy delivery platform, in-licensed by Amryt in March 2018, that utilises a non-viral delivery vector, HPAE (Highly Branched Poly β-Amino Ester), designed to deliver the correct collagen VII gene into skin cells.

Joe Wiley, CEO of Amryt Pharma, commented: “Receiving an orphan drug designation from the FDA for our gene-therapy candidate, AP103, is a significant development for patients suffering from EB and provides additional momentum to our development pipeline. Unlike other gene therapies that rely on viral vectors, AP103 is based on a novel polymer-based topical delivery platform, which we believe offers potential advantages in the gene-therapy field and has potential to be used in other genetic skin conditions.”

About Amryt
Amryt is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering innovative new treatments to help improve the lives of patients with rare and orphan diseases. Amryt comprises a strong and growing portfolio of commercial and development assets.

Amryt’s commercial business comprises two orphan disease products.

Amryt’s lead development candidate, FILSUVEZ® (Oleogel-S10) is a potential treatment for the cutaneous manifestations of Epidermolysis Bullosa (“EB”), a rare and distressing genetic skin disorder affecting young children and adults for which there is currently no approved treatment. FILSUVEZ® has been selected as the brand name for the product. Amryt does not have regulatory approval for FILSUVEZ® to treat EB. In September and October 2020, Amryt reported positive results from its pivotal global Phase 3 trial in EB. The product has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and has also received a Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Myalept® / Myalepta® (metreleptin) is approved in the US (under the trade name Myalept®) as an adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy (GL) and in the EU (under the trade name Myalepta®) for the treatment of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired GL in adults and children two years of age and above and familial or acquired partial lipodystrophy (PL) in adults and children 12 years of age and above for whom standard treatments have failed to achieve adequate metabolic control. Metreleptin is also approved for lipodystrophy in Japan. Generalised and partial lipodystrophy are rare disorders characterised by loss or lack of adipose tissue resulting in the deficiency of the hormone leptin, produced by fat cells and are associated with severe metabolic abnormalities including severe insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver disease.

Juxtapid®/ Lojuxta® (lomitapide) is approved as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering medicinal products for adults with the rare cholesterol disorder, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (“HoFH”) in the US, Canada, Columbia, Argentina and Japan (under the trade name Juxtapid®) and in the EU and Brazil (under the trade name Lojuxta®). HoFH is a rare genetic disorder which impairs the body’s ability to remove low density lipoprotein (“LDL”) cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol) from the blood, typically leading to abnormally high blood LDL cholesterol levels in the body from before birth – often ten times more than people without HoFH – and subsequent aggressive and premature cardiovascular disease.

In March 2018, Amryt in-licensed a pre-clinical gene-therapy platform technology, AP103, which offers a potential treatment for patients with Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa, a subset of EB, and is also potentially relevant to other genetic disorders.

 The company reports positive interim results for the P-IIb part of it P-IIb/III Ifenprodil COVID-19 study and expecting the final data set by end of Feb 2021
 NP-120 (Ifenprodil) is an NMDA receptor antagonist specifically targeting the NMDA-type subunit 2B, & prevents glutamate signaling. The NMDA receptor is found on many tissues including lung cells, T-cells & neutrophils","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Algernon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CSE: AGN) (FRANKFURT: AGW) (OTCQB: AGNPF) (the “Company” or “Algernon”) a clinical-stage pharmaceutical development company, is pleased to announce that the last patient from the Phase 2b part of its multinational Phase 2b/3 human study of NP-120 (Ifenprodil) for the treatment of COVID-19, has now completed treatment as well as the required two-week follow-up.

The Company announced positive trending interim data for the Phase 2b part of its Phase 2b/3 Ifenprodil COVID-19 Study, on December 15, 2020. The Company is projecting the final data set will be available before the end of February 2021.

“This is another important step for the Company,” said Christopher J. Moreau, CEO of Algernon Pharmaceuticals. “Now that we have announced the final patient out of the Ifenprodil COVID-19 study, we can begin preparations for the final data report.”

The Company advises that it is not making any express or implied claims that Ifenprodil has the ability to eliminate, cure or contain COVID-19 (or the SARS-2 Coronavirus) at this time.

About NP-120 (Ifenprodil)

NP-120 (Ifenprodil) is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist specifically targeting the NMDA-type subunit 2B (Glu2NB). Ifenprodil prevents glutamate signaling. The NMDA receptor is found on many tissues including lung cells, T-cells, and neutrophils.

The Company believes Ifenprodil can reduce the infiltration of neutrophils and T-cells into the lungs where they can release glutamate and cytokines respectively. The latter can result in the highly problematic cytokine storm that contributes to the loss of lung function and ultimately death as has been reported in COVID-19 infected patients.

About Algernon Pharmaceuticals Inc. 

Algernon is a drug re-purposing company that investigates safe, already approved drugs for new disease applications, moving them efficiently and safely into new human trials, developing new formulations and seeking new regulatory approvals in global markets. Algernon specifically investigates compounds that have never been approved in the U.S. or Europe to avoid off label prescription writing.

Algernon has filed new intellectual property rights globally for NP-120 (Ifenprodil) for the treatment of respiratory diseases and is working to develop a proprietary injectable and slow-release formulation.

54018,Janssen Report MAA Submission of Amivantamab to EMA for Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations,Janssen Submits European Marketing Authorisation Application for Amivantamab for the Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations,"The EMA Submission is based on P-l CHRYSALIS study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Amivantamab as a monotherapy and in combination with Lazertinib in adult patients for the treatment of advanced NSCLC
 Result of CHRYSALIS Study assessed efficacy using overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria, CBR, DOR and PFS as well as the safety profile of amivantamab
 Amivantamab is an investigational, fully – human EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell – directing activity that targets tumours with activating and resistance EGFR mutations and MET mutations and amplifications","The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today the submission of a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of amivantamab for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. The application marks the first-ever regulatory submission in the EU for a treatment for patients with NSCLC that specifically targets EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.1

Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human EGFR and mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumours with activating and resistance EGFR and MET mutations and amplifications.2,3,4,5

“The EMA submission represents an important milestone in our commitment to develop innovative, targeted therapies like amivantamab for patients facing a lung cancer diagnosis,” said Peter Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “This is an important step forward in our drive towards improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with NSCLC who have EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations where there are no EMA-approved targeted treatments today.”

The EMA submission for amivantamab is based on monotherapy data from the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, a multi-centre, open-label, multi-cohort study evaluating the safety and efficacy of amivantamab as a monotherapy and in combination with lazertinib,* a novel third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI),6 in adult patients with advanced NSCLC.7 In the study, investigators assessed efficacy using overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1** (RECIST v1.1), clinical benefit rate, and duration of response and progression-free survival, as well as the safety profile of amivantamab.7,8 This data was also the basis of the submission of the Biologics License Application for amivantamab to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020. Early data about amivantamab as a monotherapy treatment in patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2020 Virtual Scientific Program (Abstract #9512).8

“Lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer death in Europe and has one of the lowest five-year survival rates for patients with cancer.9 Given this significant unmet need, we are committed to improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with this complex disease,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. “With today’s submission for amivantamab, we are one step closer to our goal of advancing novel therapeutics that will transform the trajectory of some of the most challenging diseases of our time, including lung cancer.”

“Lung cancer is responsible for 20% of cancer deaths in Europe: more than breast and prostate cancer combined.9 Despite advances in treatment, there is still a high unmet need amongst patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, particularly in the exon 20 insertion mutation population due to poor response to treatments that work for other mutations,10” said Joaquín Casariego, M.D., Therapeutic Area Lead Oncology for Europe, Middle East & Africa, Janssen-Cilag, S.A. “We are encouraged by the promising results of amivantamab which continue to demonstrate potential for providing a new treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.8 This submission is an important milestone, and we look forward to working closely with the EMA as the application process progresses.”

EGFR mutations, which drive tumours by causing uncontrolled cancer cell growth and division,11 are some of the most common mutations in NSCLC.12 EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are the third most prevalent primary EGFR mutation.13 However, EGFR exon 20 insertions are also often undetected.13 Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is effective at detecting EGFR exon 20 insertions and broader use of NGS can help to detect these mutations.13 Cancer driven by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is generally insensitive to approved EGFR TKI treatments and has a worse prognosis compared with cancer driven by more common EGFR mutations, including exon 19 deletions/L858R substitutions.10 Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a median survival of 16 months,14 which is much lower than patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R substitutions, who have a median survival of 32-39 months.15

ENDS

*In 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc. entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib.

**RECIST (version 1.1) refers to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, which is a standard way to measure how well solid tumours respond to treatment and is based on whether tumours shrink, stay the same, or get bigger.

About Amivantamab

Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumours with activating and resistance EGFR mutations and MET mutations and amplifications.2,3,4,5 Amivantamab is pending regulatory review as a potential treatment for NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.’s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBody® technology platform.16

About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

In Europe, it is estimated that over 470,000 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer in 2018, with around 85 percent diagnosed with NSCLC.17,18 Lung cancer is Europe’s biggest cancer killer, with more deaths than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.19 The five-year survival rate for patients with metastatic NSCLC is currently 24 percent.19

The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.20 Among the most common driver mutations in NSCLC are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase supporting cells growth and division.11 EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of Caucasian patients with NSCLC and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients who have NSCLC adenocarcinoma.12 Estimated median overall survival for patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is shorter than in patients with more common EGFR mutations.14

“Partnering with Cullinan for their potential best-in-class EGFR inhibitor targeting exon 20 insertion (Ex20ins) mutations provides potential synergies with Zai’s existing lung cancer franchise and further strengthens our disease area stronghold in lung cancer,” said Dr. Samantha Du, Founder, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of Zai Lab. “The unmet need in non-small-cell lung cancer with Ex20ins mutations is significant in China, where EGFR mutation rates are some of the highest in the world. Zai looks forward to working closely with Cullinan to address this large unmet medical need.”

“Zai Lab is the ideal partner for innovative drug development and commercialization in Greater China, and we are excited to be collaborating with them on CLN-081,” said Owen Hughes, Chief Executive Officer of Cullinan Oncology. “Approved EGFR inhibitors do not adequately address exon 20 insertion mutations. We believe that CLN-081, with its encouraging preliminary efficacy and safety data, can address a significant unmet medical need among lung cancer patients with these mutations. We look forward to working with Zai to initiate development of CLN-081 in China as soon as possible.”

About CLN-081

CLN-081 is an orally available, small-molecule, next-generation, irreversible EGFR inhibitor designed to selectively target cells expressing mutant EGFR variants. CLN-081 is currently in a Phase 1/2a dose escalation and expansion trial evaluating oral, twice-daily administration of various doses in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR Ex20ins mutations who have had at least one prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy or another approved standard therapy.

Indication

ORGOVYX is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer.

Select Important Safety Information

Androgen deprivation therapy, such as ORGOVYX, may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, or frequent electrolyte abnormalities and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes.

The safety and efficacy of ORGOVYX have not been established in females. Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, ORGOVYX can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of ORGOVYX.

Most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) in patients receiving ORGOVYX were hot flush (54%), musculoskeletal pain (30%), fatigue (26%), constipation (12%), and diarrhea (12%).

Most common laboratory abnormalities (≥ 15%) in patients receiving ORGOVYX were glucose increased (44%), triglycerides increased (35%), hemoglobin decreased (28%), alanine aminotransferase increased (27%), and aspartate aminotransferase increased (18%).

Co-administration of ORGOVYX with a P-gp inhibitor increases the area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) of ORGOVYX, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with ORGOVYX. Avoid co-administration of ORGOVYX with oral P-gp inhibitors. If co-administration is unavoidable, take ORGOVYX first, separate dosing by at least 6 hours, and monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions.

Co-administration of ORGOVYX with a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducer decreases the AUC and Cmax of ORGOVYX, which may reduce the effects of ORGOVYX. Avoid co-administration of ORGOVYX with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers. If co-administration is unavoidable, increase the ORGOVYX dose to 240 mg once daily.
