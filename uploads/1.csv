 	<li><strong><i>Remdesivir is an investigational agent – it is not approved anywhere </i><i>globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use.</i></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><i>The UK is one of the countries where Gilead is running clinical trials to evaluate remdesivir </i><i>for the treatment of COVID-19</i></strong></li>
</ul>
London, April 1st 2020 – Gilead Sciences announced today that the company has initiated two phase 3 randomised studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its investigational treatment remdesivir in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (coronavirus). The two studies which have been given urgent public health research (UPHR) status by the Chief Medical Office will initially involve 15 centres* in the UK.
“Gilead started research into remdesivir more than a decade ago. We are now in a position to consider its potential to treat COVID-19 and rapidly progress its development, and these clinical trials will help generate important data on the safety and efficacy of the medication in the coming weeks,” said Hilary Hutton-Squire, Vice President and General Manager, Gilead Sciences UK &amp; Ireland. “Gilead is supporting clinical trials of remdesivir around the world, and we are grateful to the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for their support in getting these trials off the ground with such speed in the UK.”
Dr Siu Ping Lam, Director of Licensing Division of MHRA said: “The MHRA is ready to prioritise and provide any assistance for clinical trials and other regulatory applications in response to COVID-19, in line with government priorities. We have procedures for rapid scientific advice, reviews and approvals and are ready to support manufacturers, researchers and other regulators. We have dedicated resources to ensure this happens, as we did during the Ebola crisis when we authorised clinical trial applications within a week.”

About Remdesivir
Remdesivir is an investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity demonstrated both in vitro and in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens including Marburg, MERS, SARS, and more recently Ebola. The viral pathogens MERS and SARS are also coronaviruses and are structurally similar to the SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. As this is a new virus, there are no approved medicines and little clinical trial data with potential treatments. The limited preclinical data for remdesivir in MERS and SARS indicates that the medicine may have potential activity against SARSCoV-2. Remdesivir is an investigational agent – it is not approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>First Positive Head-to-Head Phase 3 Trial Comparing a Single-Agent Cancer Medicine to Standard of Care Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment for MSI-H or dMMR Colorectal Cancer</b></p>
<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Merck to Share Data from KEYNOTE-177 with Global Regulatory Authorities and at an Upcoming Medical Congress</b></p>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-177 trial evaluating first-line treatment of KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer met one of its dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS). Based on an interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), KEYTRUDA monotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with chemotherapy (investigator’s choice of mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI, with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab). Based on the recommendation of the DMC, the study will continue without changes to evaluate overall survival (OS), the other dual primary endpoint. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with previously reported studies, and no new safety signals were identified.

“These head-to-head data with KEYTRUDA are the first time a single-agent, anti-cancer therapy, and particularly an anti-PD-1 monotherapy, achieved a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival over chemotherapy, including the current standard of care regimen of mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab, in patients with MSI-H colorectal cancer,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “These data in the first-line treatment setting provide further evidence of the benefits of KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients whose tumors are MSI-H or dMMR. We look forward to sharing these data as quickly as possible with the medical community and regulatory authorities.”

In May 2017, KEYTRUDA became the first cancer therapy approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration for use based on a biomarker, regardless of tumor type, in previously treated patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors.

Microsatellite instability (or MSI) is defined by the National Cancer Institute as a change that occurs in the DNA of certain cells (such as tumor cells) in which the number of repeats of microsatellites (short, repeated sequences of DNA) is different from the number of repeats that was in the DNA when it was inherited. The cause of microsatellite instability may be a defect in the ability to repair mistakes made when DNA is copied in the cell. This defect is also referred to as mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). It is estimated that approximately 10-15% of colorectal cancer patients have tumors that score as either MSI-H or dMMR when testing is performed.

<b>About KEYNOTE-177
</b>KEYNOTE-177 (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/"">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT02563002&amp;esheet=52197953&amp;newsitemid=20200402005209&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT02563002&amp;index=1&amp;md5=38870a5db7319f0964da5f265a0761d2"" rel=""nofollow"">NCT02563002</a>) is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA monotherapy versus standard of care chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with MSI-H or dMMR advanced colorectal cancer. The dual primary endpoints are PFS and OS, and the secondary endpoint is ORR. The study enrolled 308 patients who were randomized to receive either:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>KEYTRUDA (200 mg fixed dose every three weeks for up to 35 cycles of treatment [up to approximately two years]); or</li>

<b>About Colorectal Cancer
</b>Colorectal cancer starts in the colon or the rectum, and these cancers are referred to as colon cancer and rectal cancer depending on where the cancer starts. Colorectal cancer often begins with growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum called polyps, which can change into cancer over time. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide.It is estimated there were nearly 850,000 new cases of colorectal cancer and more than 880,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2018. In the United States, it is estimated there will be nearly 105,000 new cases of colon cancer and more than 43,000 new cases of rectal cancer, resulting in more than 53,000 deaths from colorectal cancer in 2020.The five-year survival rates for advanced/metastatic colon cancer and rectal cancer (stage IV) are estimated to be 14% and 15%, respectively.

<b>About KEYTRUDA<sup> ®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg
</b>KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>

<b>Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)</b>

<i>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
</i>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib
</i>KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
</b>Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
</b>Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
</b>Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
</b>In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

<b>Embryofetal Toxicity
</b>Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk.

<p class=""bwalignc""><i>- Vir to Lead Development of Potential Coronavirus RNAi Therapeutic Candidates Discovered by Alnylam, with Alnylam Retaining an Option for 50-50 Participation -</i></p>
SAN FRANCISCO &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 2, 2020-- Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY) today announced an expansion to their broad multi-target existing collaboration for the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics for infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19. This expansion includes up to three additional targets focused on host factors for SARS-CoV-2, including ACE2 and TMPRSS2, both of which are considered critical for viral entry, with the potential for an additional host target to emerge from Vir’s functional genomics work.

Pursuant to an amendment to the collaboration agreement, the companies will utilize Alnylam’s recent advances in lung delivery of novel conjugates of siRNA – the molecules that mediate RNAi – together with Vir’s infectious disease expertise and established capabilities, to bring forward up to three additional host factor-targeting development candidates (DCs) to treat SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other coronaviruses as well. The two named targets include angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). ACE2 is known to be the viral entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, while TMPRSS2 is believed to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to facilitate cellular attachment. The third target is expected to emerge from Vir’s ongoing functional genomics efforts to identify novel host factors pertinent to coronaviral infection and targetable by siRNA, mAbs or small molecules.

As part of the original collaboration to advance investigational RNAi therapeutics to treat disease caused by coronavirus infection, Alnylam has designed and synthesized over 350 siRNAs targeting highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Lead siRNAs have recently been identified by scientists at Alnylam and are now being further evaluated by scientists at Vir for anti-viral activity in support of DC selection. Upon DC selection, Vir will lead development efforts – working closely with Alnylam to generate the data required to enable the potential for rapid commencement of clinical studies.

“Vir is aggressively pursuing multiple platforms and multiple therapeutic strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We are excited about our partnership with Alnylam – which has already led to identification of promising siRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 – and we’re pleased to now expand our efforts to evaluate the anti-viral effects of siRNAs targeting human host factors,” said George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO of Vir. “We share a sense of urgency with Alnylam in advancing these efforts as quickly as possible and with the highest priority.”

“The biopharmaceutical industry needs to advance its full armamentarium of potential treatment approaches and strategies to address the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we are excited about the promise of targeting host factors critical for viral infection and replication, in addition to our efforts directly targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. “At this time of enormous public health need, we plan to act with the utmost urgency to broaden and accelerate our efforts with Vir to develop investigational RNAi therapeutics against COVID-19, and potentially future coronavirus diseases.”

Under the collaboration and license agreement, as amended, in addition to leading development of selected DCs, Vir will lead commercialization of any products emerging from the collaboration that gain regulatory approval. At clinical proof of concept, Alnylam will have an option to share equally in any profits and losses associated with the development and commercialization of each coronavirus program. Alternatively, Alnylam may elect to earn development and commercialization milestones and royalties on net sales of any products resulting from the collaboration in amounts agreed upon for each coronavirus program. These additional targets expand the companies’ collaboration and license agreement announced in 2017, and the subsequent amendment to that agreement announced in March 2020, to now develop novel siRNAs for up to nine infectious disease targets in total, including hepatitis B virus in the Vir-2218 (ALN-HBV02) program currently in Phase 1/2 studies.

<b>About RNAi
</b>RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved RUXIENCE™ (rituximab), a monoclonal antibody (mAb) and biosimilar to MabThera<sup>®</sup> (rituximab), for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV).<sup>1,2,3</sup>

”The approval of biosimilars such as RUXIENCE is an important development for the treatment of certain cancers and autoimmune conditions,” said Igor Aurer, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine and Head of Hematology Division, University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia. “It’s a step toward allowing clinicians an additional treatment option which can help improve access for patients in need of this established medicine.”

The EC approval is based on a comprehensive data package which demonstrated biosimilarity of RUXIENCE to the reference product. This includes results from the REFLECTIONS B3281006 clinical comparative study, which evaluated the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RUXIENCE and found no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy compared to the reference product in patients with CD20-positive, low tumor burden follicular lymphoma.<sup>4</sup>

“Biosimilars like RUXIENCE exhibit a similar safety and efficacy profile to the originator product and have the potential to improve treatment access while reducing healthcare costs,” said Masum Hossain, regional president, Oncology International Developed Markets at Pfizer. “Building on our ongoing commitment to bring biosimilars to market, we look forward to making RUXIENCE available to patients in the EU in the coming months.”

Biosimilars have been a significant catalyst for change for the healthcare industry over the last decade, with the potential to help create more sustainable healthcare systems. With more than 10 years of global in-market experience and a portfolio which now includes seven approved biosimilar products in Europe, Pfizer is proud to be a leader and at the forefront of this vital healthcare segment. This approval follows the positive recommendation from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in January 2020.<sup>5 </sup>RUXIENCE was recently made available to adult patients in the United States for the treatment of NHL, CLL, GPA and MPA and also launched in Japan in January 2020.

<b>About RUXIENCE (rituximab biosimilar)</b>

RUXIENCE is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) biosimilar to MabThera which works by targeting a protein called CD20, which is present on the surface of B lymphocytes, also known as B cells. When it attaches to CD20, rituximab helps destroy these B cells.

<b>RUXIENCE safety information</b>

Do not use RUXIENCE if you are allergic to rituximab or other proteins which are like rituximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine, if you have a severe active infection at the moment or if you have a weak immune system.

RUXIENCE should also not be used if you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris.

Before starting treatment with RUXIENCE, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, RUXIENCE could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. Patients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection</li>
 	<li>you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing problems</li>
 	<li>you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant</li>
</ul>
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. In particular, tell your doctor if:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>you are taking medicines for high blood pressure</li>
 	<li>you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system – such as chemotherapy or immune-suppressive medicines</li>
</ul>
If you have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris, also tell your doctor if:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected by RUXIENCE help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you are given RUXIENCE</li>
 	<li>you had a lot of infections in the past or suffer from severeinfections</li>
 	<li>you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations needed to travel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as RUXIENCE or in the months after you receive RUXIENCE</li>
</ul>
If you are not sure, talk to your healthcare professional before you are given RUXIENCE.

Like all medicines, RUXIENCE can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most side effects are mild to moderate, but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of these reactions have been fatal.

<b>Infusion reactions</b>

RUXIENCE is given by intravenous infusion into your vein. During or within the first 24-hours of the infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less frequently, some patients may experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness (nausea), tiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat discomfort, tongue or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart attack or low number of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get worse.

Tell the person giving you the infusion immediately if you develop any of these symptoms, as the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may require additional treatment such as an antihistamine or paracetamol.

<b>Infections</b>

You might get infections more easily during your treatment with RUXIENCE. Tell your doctor immediately if you get signs of an infection including:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell</li>
 	<li>memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare, serious brain infection, which has been fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or PML)</li>
</ul>
If you are being treated for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris, you will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card you have been given by your doctor. It is important that you keep this Alert Card and show it to your partner or caregiver. Your doctor will also give you a patient booklet with more detailed information on the risks and symptoms of infections and PML.

<b>Skin reactions</b>

Very rarely, severe blistering skin conditions that can be life-threatening may occur. Redness, often associated with blisters, may appear on the skin or on mucous membranes, such as inside the mouth, the genital areas or the eyelids, and fever may be present. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.

Other very common side effects of RUXIENCE treatment include:

If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>bacterial or viral infections, bronchitis</li>
 	<li>low number of white blood cells, with or without fever or blood cells called “platelets”</li>
 	<li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>
 	<li>bald spots on the scalp, chills, headache</li>
 	<li>lower immunity – because of lower levels of antibodies called “immunoglobulins” (IgG) in the blood which help protect against infection</li>
</ul>
If you are being treated for rheumatoid arthritis:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>infections such as pneumonia (bacterial)</li>
 	<li>pain on passing water (urinary tract infection)</li>
 	<li>allergic reactions that are most likely to occur during an infusion, but can occur up-to 24-hours after infusion</li>
 	<li>changes in blood pressure, nausea, rash, fever, feeling itchy, runny or blocked nose and sneezing, shaking, rapid heartbeat, and tiredness</li>
 	<li>headache</li>
 	<li>changes in laboratory tests carried out by your doctor. These include a decrease in the amount of some specific proteins in the blood (immunoglobulins) which help protect against infection</li>
</ul>
If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>infections, such as chest infections, pain on passing water (urinary tract infections), colds and herpes infections</li>
 	<li>allergic reactions that are most likely to occur during an infusion, but can occur up-to 24-hours after infusion</li>
 	<li>diarrhea</li>
 	<li>coughing or shortness of breath</li>
 	<li>nose bleeds</li>
 	<li>raised blood pressure</li>
 	<li>painful joints or back</li>
 	<li>muscle twitches or shakiness</li>
 	<li>feeling dizzy</li>
 	<li>tremors (shakiness, often in the hands)</li>
 	<li>difficulty sleeping (insomnia)</li>
 	<li>swelling of the hands or ankles</li>
</ul>
If you are being treated for pemphigus vulgaris:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>allergic reactions that are most likely to occur during an infusion, but can occur up to 24 hours after infusion</li>
 	<li>long lasting depression</li>
 	<li>loss of hair</li>
</ul>
RUXIENCE may also cause changes in laboratory tests carried out by your doctor. If you are having RUXIENCE with other medicines, some of the side effects you may get may be due to the other medicines.

<span class=""xn-location"">WARREN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">April 2, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Celularity Inc. (""Celularity"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage company developing allogeneic cellular therapies from human placentas, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the Company's Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the use of its proprietary CYNK-001 in adults with COVID-19. With this, Celularity will commence a Phase I/II clinical study including up to 86 patients with COVID-19. The Company believes CYNK-001 is the first immunotherapy IND cleared by the FDA to treat COVID-19 infected adults.

""This IND represents a significant step toward a potential treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 virus, which is spreading globally at unanticipated rates,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Robert Hariri</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, Chairman and CEO at Celularity. ""With our initial clinical study, we will gain an understanding of the impact CYNK-001 can have on patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. We are hopeful to contribute to flattening the COVID-19 curve, expanding on the promising early results we've seen in our clinical studies in devastating cancers to patients with coronavirus."" Dr. Hariri also thanked the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) in his statement, ""While most of its work occurs out of the public's eye, CBER embodies the public service ideal amidst the current crisis. Thanks to the women and men of CBER for their tireless effort to guide us through the IND process.""

CYNK-001 is the only cryopreserved allogeneic, off-the-shelf Natural Killer (NK) cell therapy being developed from placental hematopoietic stem cells and is being investigated as a potential treatment option for various hematologic cancers and solid tumors. NK cells are a unique class of immune cells, innately capable of targeting cancer cells and interacting with adaptive immunity. CYNK-001 cells derived from the placenta are intrinsically safe and versatile and are currently being investigated as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

""Studies have established that there is robust activation of NK cells during viral infection regardless of the virus class,"" says Celularity's Chief Scientific Officer, <span class=""xn-person"">Xiaokui Zhang</span>, PhD. ""CYNK-001 demonstrates a range of biological activities expected of NK cells, including expression of activating receptors such as NKG2D, DNAM-1 and the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46, which bind to stress ligands and viral antigens on infected cells. They also show the expression of cytolytic molecules perforin and granzyme B, which kill recognized infected cells. These functions suggest that CYNK-001 could provide a benefit to COVID-19 patients in terms of limiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and disease progression by eliminating the infected cells.""

Neutralizing antibodies defend healthy cells by interfering with the biological function of an invading virus. These antibodies may be used therapeutically to treat someone currently fighting the disease and can be given to people who have heightened risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such as healthcare workers.

""Our strong history of collaboration with Adaptive gives us the ability to immediately mobilize our combined resources to help address the urgency in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. After swiftly obtaining viral gene sequences from hundreds of patients, Amgen was motivated to use these insights and quickly pair them with our drug development and manufacturing capabilities.  Working with Adaptive and using their viral-neutralizing antibody platform will expedite our ability to bring a promising new medicine into clinical trials as quickly as possible,"" said Robert A. Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer at Amgen.

Adaptive will extend its high throughput platform to rapidly screen the massive genetic diversity of the B cell receptors from individuals that have recovered from COVID-19. This enables the identification of tens of thousands of naturally occurring antibodies from survivors of COVID-19 to select those that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Amgen will then leverage its world-class antibody engineering and drug development capabilities to select, develop and manufacture antibodies designed to bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2. deCODE Genetics, a subsidiary of Amgen located in Iceland, will provide genetic insights from patients who were previously infected with COVID-19.

""We are extremely motivated to join forces with our trusted partner, Amgen, to tackle this global health crisis,"" said Chad Robins, chief executive officer and co-founder of Adaptive Biotechnologies. ""This partnership expands our drug discovery capabilities, demonstrating the power and versatility of our immune medicine platform.""

The two companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enable the parties to start work immediately and are planning to execute a Collaboration and License Agreement. Terms of the agreement are not being disclosed. Both companies aim to accelerate the development of a potential antibody against COVID-19 as fast as possible for patients in need.

</ul>
<strong>Basel, April 2, 2020</strong> — Novartis today announced plans to initiate a Phase III clinical trial in collaboration with Incyte to evaluate the use of Jakavi<sup>®</sup>(ruxolitinib) for treatment of a type of severe immune overreaction called cytokine storm that can lead to life-threatening respiratory complications in patients with COVID-19<sup>1-3</sup>.

The decision is based on pre-clinical evidence and preliminary reports from independent studies, and is supported by extensive data on the safety and efficacy of Jakavi in conditions like acute graft versus host disease and myeloproliferative neoplasms. The proposed trial will assess Jakavi in combination with standard of care (SoC) therapy, compared to SoC therapy alone, in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

“Novartis is taking a number of steps to address the urgent needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the evaluation of our existing therapies to assess if any can be utilized beyond their approved indications,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “The potential that Jakavi could lead to faster recovery times for COVID-19 patients with fewer requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation is encouraging and absolutely merits further investigation. We now are moving rapidly to finalize the study plan and then to enroll eligible patients, as well as put in place a process to provide access for patients unable to participate in the trial.”

Given the rapid spread of the pandemic, and as plans for the study are finalized, Novartis also has set up an international compassionate use program for eligible patients, subject to local regulations. In addition, we are taking steps to manage the anticipated increase in COVID-19 related requests for Jakavi without interrupting access for patients taking the drug for its licensed indications. In the US, ruxolitinib access requests are coordinated by Incyte.

<strong>Novartis commitment and response to COVID-19</strong>
Novartis is deeply dedicated to the global effort to combat COVID-19 and doing our part to support the stability of global healthcare systems. We announced a broad set of measures including the creation of a global fund of USD 20 million to support communities around the world impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Novartis also has committed 130 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to support pandemic response. In addition, Novartis joined two key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard, as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership organized by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). Novartis is separately supporting COVID-19 related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. To support access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19. More information about the Novartis response to COVID-19 is available on <strong><a title=""Novartis.com/coronavirus"" href=""https://www.novartis.com/coronavirus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Novartis.com/coronavirus</a></strong>.

<strong>About Jakavi<sup>®</sup> (ruxolitinib)</strong>
Jakavi (ruxolitinib) is an oral inhibitor of the JAK 1 and JAK 2 tyrosine kinases. Jakavi is approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea and for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (MF) (also known as chronic idiopathic MF), post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Jakavi is approved in 101 countries for patients with MF, including EU countries, Switzerland, Canada, Japan and in more than 75 countries for patients with PV, including EU countries, Switzerland, Japan and Canada. The exact indication for Jakavi varies by country. Additional worldwide regulatory filings are underway in MF and PV.

Novartis licensed ruxolitinib from Incyte Corporation for development and commercialization in selected indications outside the United States. Ruxolitinib is marketed in the United States by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi<sup>®</sup>for patients with PV who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, for patients with intermediate or high-risk MF, and steroid-refractory acute GvHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older<sup>4</sup>.

The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in PV is 10 mg given orally twice daily. The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in MF is 15 mg given orally twice daily for patients with a platelet count between 100,000 cubic millimeters (mm) and 200,000 mm, and 20 mg twice daily for patients with a platelet count of &gt;200,000 mm. Doses may be titrated based on safety and efficacy. There is limited information to recommend a starting dose for MF and PV patients with platelet counts between 50,000/mm and &lt;100,000/mm. The maximum recommended starting dose in these patients is 5 mg twice daily, and patients should be titrated cautiously<sup>4</sup>.

Jakavi is a registered trademark of Novartis AG in countries outside the United States. Jakafi is a registered trademark of Incyte Corporation. The safety and efficacy profile of Jakavi has not yet been established outside of its approved indications.

<strong>Jakavi Important Safety Information for Treatment of Myelofibrosis (MF) and Polycythemia Vera (PV)</strong>
Jakavi can cause serious side effects, including a decrease in blood cell count and infections. Complete blood count monitoring is recommended. Dose reduction or interruption may be required in patients with any hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment or in patients developing hematologic adverse reactions such as thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia. Dose reductions are also recommended when Jakavi is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole. Use of Jakavi during pregnancy is not recommended, and women should avoid becoming pregnant during Jakavi therapy. Women taking Jakavi should not breast feed. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported. Physicians should be alert for neuropsychiatric symptoms suggestive of PML. Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increases have been reported in patients with chronic HBV infections. Patients with chronic HBV infection should be treated and monitored according to clinical guidelines. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) has been reported in Jakavi treated patients. Periodic skin examination is recommended. Very common adverse reactions in MF (&gt;10%) include urinary tract infections, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, hypercholesterolemia, dizziness, headache, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, bruising and weight gain. Common adverse reactions in MF (1 to 10%) include herpes zoster and flatulence. Uncommon adverse reactions in MF include tuberculosis. Very common adverse reactions in PV (&gt;10%) include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased. Common adverse reactions in PV (1 to 10%) include urinary tract infections, herpes zoster, weight gain, constipation and hypertension.

INCHEON, South Korea--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Celltrion Group today announced its successful transition to the second phase of development for an antiviral treatment to fight the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, following the completion of the first phase of securing 300 different types of antibodies that bind to the antigen last month. The library of antibodies was created using the blood of recovered patients in Korea.

In cooperation with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), Celltrion will be screening the antibodies to find the ones most effective in neutralising SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. Celltrion anticipates the candidate screening for the therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) will be complete by mid-April, sooner than originally expected.

Ki-Sung Kwon, Head of R&amp;D Unit at Celltrion said, “Once we have selected the one that most effectively neutralizes the COVID-19 virus among hundreds of the screened antibodies, we will roll out mass production of the therapeutic antibody treatment, with a view to starting human trials this July. Due to the urgent need for a COVID-19 antiviral treatment, we have expedited the overall development process of our antiviral therapy to help infected patients fight this emerging virus and halt further spread of the disease.”

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""main-container"">
<div class=""content-wrapper"">

GSK is closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and is supporting global efforts to tackle the virus. Since the outbreak, we have been actively exploring ways to help, with our science and expertise, alongside protecting the health and wellbeing of our people and managing our global supply chains to support patients and consumers who depend on our products.

<strong>Supporting research and production of candidate COVID-19 vaccines</strong>

GSK’s initial response to the outbreak of COVID-19 has been to make our vaccine adjuvant technology available to scientists and organisations working on promising vaccine candidates and technology platforms. The use of an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protecting more people.

Since announcing collaborations with the University of Queensland and Clover Biopharmaceuticals, we have expanded our collaborations and are now collaborating with several companies and research groups across the world, including in the USA and China.

Most recently, we have announced that GSK and Xiamen Innovax Biotech Co., Ltd. will collaborate to evaluate a recombinant protein-based coronavirus vaccine candidate (COVID-19 XWG-03), being developed by Innovax with Xiamen University. GSK will provide Innovax with its pandemic adjuvant system for preclinical evaluation of the COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 XWG-03 vaccine candidate technology is based on a series of truncated S (spike) proteins which will be screened during the pre-clinical testing and a lead candidate will be determined by immunogenicity data.

Early indications of the adjuvant’s benefit have been reported in the first pre-clinical experiments by one of the collaborations. GSK expects data to be reported from the various collaborations over the next 3 months and these data will inform next steps for clinical development of the candidate vaccines.

GSK is evaluating further collaboration opportunities with several other companies and institutions. The company is also exploring options to share available manufacturing capacity, to help provide scale manufacturing and production for an eventual vaccine.

<h2 class=""video-area__video-title"">What is an adjuvant?</h2>
<div class=""video-area__video-content"">

An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to enhance the immune response, thereby creating a stronger and longer lasting immunity against infections than the vaccine alone. The use of an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it can reduce the amount of antigen required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and made available to more people.

<strong>Screening and research into new medicines</strong>

GSK is entering into the new collaborative research effort, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator. The aim of the Accelerator is to bring pharmaceutical companies and expert academic institutions into coordinated research programs, with the aim of bringing the most promising molecules forward that could be used to treat cases of COVID-19. GSK will contribute by making available compounds from its libraries for screening for activity against COVID-19.

In addition, GSK is evaluating its marketed pharmaceutical products and medicines in development to determine if any could be used beyond their current indications in response to the pandemic. This includes medicines with potential direct anti-viral activity and those with possible utility in prevention or treatment of secondary complications of COVID-19. The company is also evaluating options to make available its specialised R&amp;D laboratory space to help in research and testing of COVID-19.

<strong>Helping frontline health workers and offering expertise</strong>

GSK is donating $10 million to The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, created by the UN Foundation and WHO, to support WHO and partners to prevent, detect, and manage the pandemic, particularly where the needs are the greatest. Amongst its objectives, the fund will enable distribution of essential supplies such as personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline health workers. GSK is also donating surplus reagents to support diagnostic testing to several countries and is preparing to do the same for surplus PPE.

GSK has also initiated new volunteering processes for people working at the company, to enable those with medical expertise to provide support to frontline health workers, whilst at the same time ensuring we protect supply and development of our medicines and vaccines. Initiatives have also been started to use salesforce personnel to help with delivery of PPE and testing equipment, and for specialists, such as procurement leaders, to work with national governments on developing supply chains.

<strong>Taking action to deliver high-demand consumer healthcare products</strong>

GSK Consumer Healthcare is prioritising actions in its supply chain to deliver more products that are in high demand, due to COVID-19. This includes increasing production for pain relief brands such as <em>Panadol</em> and multi-vitamins and dietary supplements such as <em>Emergen-C </em>and<em> Centrum</em>.

<strong>Further actions and updates</strong>

We will provide regular updates on our progress and our efforts to support the global response to COVID-19. We continue to monitor the situation closely and will take further actions to develop our response to the pandemic, including ideas and support for long-term, global pandemic preparedness. In doing so, we will continue to put the needs of patients and our people first at all times.

<strong>More about the medicine</strong>

Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine which is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir is a ‘viral RNA polymerase inhibitor’ (a medicine that interferes with the production of viral genetic material, preventing the virus from multiplying). It has shown broad <em>in vitro</em> activity against different RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and was originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus disease.

Remdesivir is being developed by Gilead Sciences Ireland CU and is given by infusion (drip) into a vein.

<p align=""justify""><strong>About Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC Product Platform</strong>
The Company’s proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) product platform enables mass production of off-the-shelf, engineered, homogeneous cell products that can be administered with multiple doses to deliver more effective pharmacologic activity, including in combination with cycles of other cancer treatments. Human iPSCs possess the unique dual properties of unlimited self-renewal and differentiation potential into all cell types of the body. The Company’s first-of-kind approach involves engineering human iPSCs in a one-time genetic modification event and selecting a single engineered iPSC for maintenance as a clonal master iPSC line. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, clonal master iPSC lines are a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf for patient treatment. As a result, the Company’s platform is uniquely capable of overcoming numerous limitations associated with the production of cell therapies using patient- or donor-sourced cells, which is logistically complex and expensive and is subject to batch-to-batch and cell-to-cell variability that can affect clinical safety and efficacy. Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC product platform is supported by an intellectual property portfolio of over 250 issued patents and 150 pending patent applications.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Fate Therapeutics, Inc.</strong>

<p class=""bwalignc""><b><i>-- Multi-year, Multi-program Agreement Leverages Latest Insights of Microbiome --</i></b></p>
FOSTER CITY, Calif. &amp; SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 6, 2020-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Second Genome, a leader in microbiome science, today announced that the companies have entered into a four-year strategic collaboration to identify biomarkers associated with clinical response in up to five of Gilead’s pipeline compounds in inflammation, fibrosis and other diseases, and to identify potential new targets and drug candidates for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
<p id=""news-body-cta"">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200406005220/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200406005220/en/</a></p>
Under the terms of the agreement, Second Genome will utilize its proprietary Microbiome Analytics Platform™ to identify novel biomarkers associated with clinical response to Gilead’s investigational medicines. This work will harness the latest insights in microbiome science to help inform patient stratification and optimize potential treatments for patients in the future. The platform, in combination with additional discovery and development tools, will also seek to identify new targets and drug candidates relevant to IBD. This will include the identification of up to five novel IBD targets or drug candidates over the next four years, with an option to extend the collaboration for an additional two years.

“There is a growing body of evidence that the microbiome plays an important role in disease progression and treatment response in inflammatory diseases,” said William Lee, PhD, Executive Vice President of Research at Gilead Sciences. “We look forward to working with Second Genome to investigate the microbiome’s role in inflammatory disease and particularly IBD, where patients can face significant challenges in achieving long-term remission with conventional therapies. This collaboration is the latest example of Gilead’s ongoing commitment to advance research in inflammatory diseases, combining external innovation and insights from Second Genome with our own expertise, as we work to bring forward transformative therapies to improve patient outcomes.”

“The Second Genome platform seeks to redefine diseases through the lens of the microbiome, utilizing this incredible resource to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutics,” said Karim Dabbagh, PhD, CEO of Second Genome. “We believe the microbiome holds insight into patient heterogeneity as well as response to specific therapies. These differences enable the identification of important biomarkers to enhance precision medicine for better patient segmentation as well as potential combination therapies. We are excited to be collaborating with Gilead using these approaches in IBD for new biomarkers as well as target and drug candidate discovery, driving toward improved clinical outcomes for patients.”

Second Genome will receive $38 million in an upfront payment, and up to approximately $300 million in success-based preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones for each of five target discovery programs as well as low double-digit royalties for any approved products. In addition, it will receive success-based milestones for each validated biomarker delivered under the agreement.

Gilead will have the option to worldwide rights for up to five programs for all diseases as well as exclusive rights to all biomarkers developed under the collaboration.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Second Genome</span></b>

In addition, the companies have completed a cross-license of their respective intellectual property for Alnylam’s lumasiran and Dicerna’s nedosiran investigational programs for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria (PH). These agreements will enhance and accelerate Alnylam’s and Dicerna’s ability to bring these orphan product candidates to market.

“We are excited to bring our two leading RNAi therapeutics companies together in our efforts to advance potentially transformative medicines for the treatment of two rare diseases with significant unmet medical need. Specifically, the new agreements allow for Alnylam and Dicerna to join forces in areas of common interest, namely alpha-1 liver disease and primary hyperoxaluria,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “We look forward to collaborating with Dicerna to advance treatments for patients living with alpha-1 liver disease, where Dicerna will lead development and U.S.commercialization while Alnylam retains an ex-U.S. commercialization option, where the company already has the resources and experience to hit the ground running. Moreover, our cross-license agreement for primary hyperoxaluria puts the needs of patients and the patient community first, and ensures freedom to operate for both companies for their respective RNAi therapeutic programs in this ultra-rare orphan disease.”

“These agreements between Alnylam and Dicerna represent biopharma collaboration at its best, unifying the strengths of two leaders in RNAi innovation to rally behind the common goal of delivering much-needed new therapies to patients with rare diseases,” said Douglas M. Fambrough, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Dicerna. “By joining our efforts in alpha-1 liver disease, we believe we can be more strongly assured of bringing forward the therapy with the greatest potential to benefit patients. At the same time, our agreement related to lumasiran and nedosiran clears a path for each company to offer a new and differentiated treatment to patients with PH.”

Under the development and commercialization agreement, Alnylam’s ALN-AAT02 and Dicerna’s DCR-A1AT, investigational RNAi therapeutics, each in Phase 1/2 development, will be explored for the treatment of alpha-1 liver disease. Under the agreement, Dicerna assumes responsibility for both ALN-AAT02 and DCR-A1AT at its cost, and may progress one or both of these investigational medicines through clinical development. Dicerna will select which product candidate(s) to advance in development for the treatment of patients with alpha-1 liver disease. At the completion of Phase 3, Alnylam has the no-cost opportunity to opt-in to commercialize the selected candidate in countries outside the U.S., where it already has a commercialization infrastructure in place. If Alnylam exercises its opt-in right, each party shall pay tiered royalties to the other party based on net product sales generated in its territory at rates dependent on which candidate is commercialized. In the event Alnylam waives its commercialization option, Dicerna will retain worldwide rights to commercialize the selected candidate(s) in exchange for milestones and royalties payable to Alnylam, also at a rate dependent on which candidate is ultimately commercialized.

In a separate agreement, Alnylam and Dicerna granted each other a non-exclusive cross-license to their respective intellectual property related to their PH treatment investigational programs to ensure that each party has the freedom to develop and commercialize its respective product candidate: Alnylam’s lumasiran targeting glycolate oxidase (GO) for the treatment of PH type 1 and Dicerna’s nedosiran targeting lactate dehydrogenase A (<i>LDHA</i>) for the treatment of PH types 1, 2, and 3. Alnylam’s lumasiran has achieved positive Phase 3 results in the ILLUMINATE-A study and is currently the subject of a rolling new drug application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dicerna’s nedosiran is currently being evaluated in the PHYOX<sup>™</sup> clinical development program in patients with PH. The cross-license agreement provides for Alnylam to pay mid- to high-single-digit royalties to Dicerna based on global net sales of lumasiran and for Dicerna to pay low-single-digit royalties to Alnylam on global net sales of nedosiran.

The transaction related to alpha-1 liver disease is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary conditions.

<b>About ALN-AAT02 and DCR-A1AT</b>

ALN-AAT02 and DCR-A1AT are investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutics targeting alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) in development for the treatment of A1AT deficiency-associated liver disease (alpha-1 liver disease). ALN-AAT02 utilizes Alnylam's enhanced stabilization chemistry plus (ESC+)-GalNAc-conjugate technology, which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased selectivity and a wide therapeutic index. DCR-A1AT utilizes Dicerna’s GalXC<sup>TM</sup> technology, which enables subcutaneous delivery and optimizes the activity of the RNAi pathway so that it operates in the most specific and potent fashion. The safety and efficacy of ALN-AAT02 and DCR-A1AT have not been evaluated by the FDA, EMA or any other health authority.

<b>About Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated Liver Disease</b>

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an autosomal disorder that results in disease of the lungs and liver. A1AT is a liver-produced serine proteinase inhibitor with the primary function of protecting the lungs from neutrophil elastase and other irritants that cause inflammation. About 95 percent of people with A1AT deficiency are homozygous and carry two copies of the abnormal Z allele (PiZZ) which expresses the Z-AAT protein. In the liver, misfolding of the mutant Z-AAT protein hinders its normal release into the blood thereby causing it to aggregate in hepatocytes, leading to liver injury, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There are estimated to be approximately 120,000 individuals with the PiZZ mutation in the U.S. and major European countries, and of these, 10 percent or more have an associated liver pathology (alpha-1 liver disease) caused by the aggregates of the misfolded Z-AAT protein. The only treatment options presently available for alpha-1 liver disease patients are supportive care and, in the case of advanced cirrhosis, liver transplantation. RNAi-mediated inhibition of A1AT in people with alpha-1 liver disease may represent a promising new way to treat this rare disease.

<b>About Lumasiran</b>

Lumasiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting glycolate oxidase (GO), in development for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), an ultra-rare life threatening disease. GO is encoded by the hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) gene. Thus, by silencing <i>HAO1</i>and depleting the GO enzyme, lumasiran inhibits production of oxalate – the metabolite that directly contributes to the pathophysiology of PH1. Lumasiran utilizes Alnylam's Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate technology, which enables quarterly subcutaneous maintenance dosing with increased potency and durability and a wide therapeutic index. Lumasiran has received both U.S. and EU Orphan Drug Designations, a Breakthrough Therapy Designation and pediatric rare disease designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The safety and efficacy of lumasiran have not been evaluated by the FDA, EMA or any other health authority.

<b>About Nedosiran</b>

Nedosiran (formerly referred to as DCR-PHXC) is the only RNAi drug candidate in development for primary hyperoxaluria (PH) types 1, 2 and 3 and is Dicerna’s most advanced product candidate utilizing the proprietary GalXC<sup>™</sup> RNAi technology platform. Nedosiran is designed to inhibit the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) enzyme – an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in a common pathway resulting in oxalate overproduction in patients with PH1, PH2 and PH3. Dicerna is evaluating the safety and efficacy of nedosiran in patients with all known forms of PH as part of its PHYOX clinical development program.

<b>About Primary Hyperoxaluria (PH)</b>

PH is an ultra-rare disease with three known types (PH1, PH2 and PH3), each resulting from a mutation in one of three different genes. In patients with PH, excessive oxalate production results in the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract and can lead to the formation of painful and recurrent kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis. Renal damage is caused by a combination of tubular toxicity from oxalate, calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys, and urinary obstruction by calcium oxalate stones. Compromised kidney function exacerbates the disease as the excess oxalate can no longer be effectively excreted, resulting in subsequent accumulation and crystallization in bones, eyes, skin, and heart, especially in patients with PH1 and PH2, leading to severe illness and death. Current treatment options are very limited and include frequent renal dialysis or combined organ transplantation of liver and kidney, a procedure with high morbidity that is limited due to organ availability. Although a minority of patients are fully responsive to Vitamin B6 therapy, there are no approved pharmaceutical therapies for PH.

<b>About RNAi</b>

RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s and Dicerna’s RNAi therapeutic platforms, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

<b>About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals</b>

Alnylam (Nasdaq: ALNY) is leading the translation of RNA interference (RNAi) into a whole new class of innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of people afflicted with rare genetic, cardio-metabolic, hepatic infectious, and central nervous system (CNS)/ocular diseases. Based on Nobel Prize-winning science, RNAi therapeutics represent a powerful, clinically validated approach for the treatment of a wide range of severe and debilitating diseases. Founded in 2002, Alnylam is delivering on a bold vision to turn scientific possibility into reality, with a robust RNAi therapeutics platform. Alnylam’s commercial RNAi therapeutic products are ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> (patisiran), approved in the U.S., EU, Canada, Japan, Brazil, and Switzerland, and GIVLAARI<sup>®</sup> (givosiran), approved in the U.S and the EU. Alnylam has a deep pipeline of investigational medicines, including six product candidates that are in late-stage development. Alnylam is executing on its “Alnylam 2020” strategy of building a multi-product, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a sustainable pipeline of RNAi-based medicines to address the needs of patients who have limited or inadequate treatment options. Alnylam is headquartered in Cambridge, MA.

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Companies will combine their unique scientific and technical expertise to combat COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus outbreaks</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Promising antibody candidates for SARS-CoV-2 to be accelerated into phase 2 clinical trials within the next three to five months</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>GSK to make equity investment of $250 million in Vir</strong></li>
</ul>
<div>GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) today announced they have signed a binding agreement to enter into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The collaboration will use Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventative options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies will leverage GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They will also apply their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&amp;D, GSK, said: “Vir’s unique antibody platform has precedented success in identifying and developing antibodies as treatments for multiple pathogens, and it is highly complementary with our R&amp;D approach to focus on the science of immunology. I am very excited that the talent and passion of our two companies will come together to develop solutions for multiple diseases, including the very promising antibody candidates targeting COVID-19.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Due to the urgent patient need for COVID-19 solutions, the initial focus of the collaboration will be to accelerate the development of specific antibody candidates identified by the Vir platform, VIR-7831 and VIR-7832, that have demonstrated high affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and are highly potent in neutralising SARS-CoV-2 in live virus-cellular assays. Subject to regulatory review, the companies plan to proceed directly into a phase 2 clinical trial within the next three to five months.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The collaboration will also utilise Vir’s CRISPR screening and machine learning approach to identify cellular targets whose inhibition can prevent viral infection. Vir has identified multiple potential targets against flu and other respiratory pathogens, as well as hepatitis B virus, and will now focus on SARS-CoV-2.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Additionally, the companies have also agreed to conduct research into SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines by coupling GSK’s vaccines technologies and expertise with Vir’s ability to identify neutralising epitopes that are present across entire viral families. These efforts will be additive to other initiatives GSK is advancing to develop a potential vaccine for COVID-19.</div>
<div></div>
<div>George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO, Vir Biotechnology, said: “It is becoming increasingly clear that multiple therapeutic approaches, used in combination or in sequence, will be necessary to stop this coronavirus pandemic. It is likely that the current coronavirus outbreak will not be the last. These insights are informing our scientific approach and we are pleased to join forces on the execution of this strategy with GSK, who have a like-minded R&amp;D strategy, a deep expertise in vaccines and an impressive global reach to bring medicines to people around the world.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition, to gain access to Vir’s technology, GSK will make an equity investment in Vir of $250 million, priced at $37.73, a 10% premium to the closing share price on Friday, March 27, 2020. The equity investment and collaboration agreement will complete at the same time and are conditional upon customary conditions including regulatory review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.</div>

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; OSAKA, Japan--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.takeda.com%2Finvestor-information%2F&amp;esheet=52198902&amp;newsitemid=20200406005146&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=%28TSE%3A4502%2FNYSE%3ATAK%29&amp;index=1&amp;md5=0f2ae735a8d24c5e6234b0852d819255"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">(TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK)</a> today announced that the European Commission (EC) extended the current marketing authorization of ALUNBRIG (brigatinib) to include use as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously not treated with an ALK inhibitor. This decision follows a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on February 27, 2020.

“Patients with ALK+ NSCLC, particularly those who have developed brain metastases, have been in need of additional treatment options that are proven effective in the first-line setting,” said Professor Sanjay Popat, Consultant Medical Oncologist, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. “As brigatinib has shown superiority compared to crizotinib in this setting, including in patients whose disease has spread to the brain, this approval is an important advancement for these patients and gives physicians in the European Union another choice when addressing the needs of ALK+ NSCLC patients.”

“At Takeda, our commitment to patients drives us as we seek to advance care and address the unmet needs of the lung cancer community,” said Teresa Bitetti, President, Global Oncology Business Unit, Takeda. “We are proud of the positive results ALUNBRIG has demonstrated in the first-line setting, including strong overall and intracranial efficacy, and look forward to making ALUNBRIG available to newly diagnosed ALK+ NSCLC patients in Europe.”

“ALK+ NSCLC is a complex and nuanced disease, and people with this form of lung cancer may benefit from the availability of a variety of treatment options,” said Stefania Vallone, President of Lung Cancer Europe (LUCE). “We welcome the availability of additional treatment options that may benefit the European cancer community and patients with this serious and rare form of the disease, with the hope that they will soon be accessible to patients across Europe.”

The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 ALTA-1L trial, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of ALUNBRIG compared to crizotinib in patients with ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have not received prior treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Results from the trial showed ALUNBRIG demonstrated superiority compared to crizotinib with significant anti-tumor activity observed in patients with baseline brain metastases. After more than two years of follow-up, ALUNBRIG reduced the risk of intracranial disease progression or death by 69% in patients with brain metastases at baseline (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.17–0.56), as assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC), and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 76% in patients with brain metastases at baseline (HR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.12–0.45), as assessed by investigators. ALUNBRIG also demonstrated consistent overall efficacy (intent to treat population), with a median progression-free survival (PFS) more than two times longer than that with crizotinib at 24.0 months (95% CI: 18.5–NE) versus 11.0 months (95% CI: 9.2–12.9) for crizotinib, as assessed by BIRC, and 29.4 months (95% CI: 21.2–NE) versus 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4–12.9), as assessed by investigators.

The safety profile of ALUNBRIG in the ALTA-1L trial was generally consistent with the existing European summary of product characteristics (SmPC). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) Grade =3 in the ALUNBRIG arm were increased CPK (24.3%), increased lipase (14.0%) and hypertension (11.8%); and for crizotinib were increased ALT (10.2%), AST (6.6%) and lipase (6.6%).

This decision by the European Medicines Agency means that ALUNBRIG is now approved for marketing of this indication in all European Union member states, in addition to Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.

<b>About the ALTA-1L Trial</b>

The Phase 3 ALTA-1L (<b>A</b>LK in <b>L</b>ung Cancer <b>T</b>rial of Brig<b>A</b>tinib in <b>1</b><sup>st</sup><b> L</b>ine) trial of ALUNBRIG in adults is a global, ongoing, randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter trial, which enrolled 275 patients (ALUNBRIG, n=137, crizotinib, n=138) with ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have not received prior treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Patients received either ALUNBRIG, 180 mg once daily with seven-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily, or crizotinib, 250 mg twice daily.

The median age was 58 years in the ALUNBRIG arm and 60 years in the crizotinib arm. Twenty-nine percent of patients had brain metastases at baseline in the ALUNBRIG arm versus 30% in the crizotinib arm. Twenty-six percent of patients received prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease in the ALUNBRIG arm versus 27% in the crizotinib arm.

Blinded independent review committee (BIRC)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, intracranial ORR, intracranial PFS, overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability.

The safety profile of ALUNBRIG in the ALTA-1L trial was generally consistent with the existing European summary of product characteristics (SmPC).

<b>About ALUNBRIG<sup>®</sup> (brigatinib)</b>

ALUNBRIG is a potent and selective next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that was designed to target and inhibit anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genetic alterations. In April 2017, ALUNBRIG received Accelerated Approval from the U.S. FDA for ALK+ metastatic NSCLC patients who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. This indication is approved under Accelerated Approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

ALUNBRIG is currently approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Canada and the European Union, for the treatment of people living with ALK+ metastatic NSCLC who have taken the medicine crizotinib, but their NSCLC has worsened or they cannot tolerate taking crizotinib.

ALUNBRIG received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with ALK+ NSCLC whose tumors are resistant to crizotinib and was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC, ROS1+ and EGFR+ NSCLC.

<b>About ALK+ NSCLC</b>

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of the estimated 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed each year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.<sup>1,2</sup> Genetic studies indicate that chromosomal rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<i>ALK</i>) are key drivers in a subset of NSCLC patients.<sup>3</sup>Approximately three to five percent of patients with metastatic NSCLC have a rearrangement in the <i>ALK </i>gene.<sup>4,5,6</sup>

Takeda is committed to continuing research and development in NSCLC to improve the lives of the approximately 40,000 patients diagnosed with this serious and rare form of lung cancer worldwide each year.<sup>7</sup>

<b>Takeda in Lung Cancer</b>

Takeda is dedicated to expanding treatment options in the ALK+ NSCLC and EGFR/HER2 mutant NSCLC treatment landscapes. Our comprehensive programs include the following clinical trials to continue to address unmet needs for people living with lung cancer:

<i>ALUNBRIG</i>

<b>ALUNBRIG<sup>®</sup> (brigatinib): GLOBAL IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>CONTRAINDICATIONS</b>

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of ALUNBRIG is contraindicated

<b>SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE</b>

<b>Pulmonary Adverse Reactions: </b>Severe, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions, including those with features consistent with ILD/pneumonitis, has been reported with ALUNBRIG. Most pulmonary adverse reactions were observed within the first 7 days of treatment. Grade 1-2 pulmonary adverse reactions resolved with interruption of treatment or dose modification. Increased age and shorter interval (less than 7 days) between the last dose of crizotinib and the first dose of ALUNBRIG were independently associated with an increased rate of these pulmonary adverse reactions. Consider these factors when initiating treatment with ALUNBRIG. Some patients experienced pneumonitis later in treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, etc.) in the first week of treatment. Promptly investigate signs of pneumonitis in any patient with worsening respiratory symptoms. If pneumonitis is suspected, withhold ALUNBRIG, and evaluate patient for other symptoms (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tumor progression, and infectious pneumonia).

<b>Hypertension</b> has been reported with ALUNBRIG. Monitor blood pressure regularly during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Treat hypertension according to standard guidelines to control blood pressure. Monitor heart rate more frequently in patients if concomitant use of a medicinal product known to cause bradycardia cannot be avoided. For severe hypertension (= Grade 3), ALUNBRIG should be withheld until hypertension has recovered to Grade 1 or to baseline. The dose should be modified accordingly.

<b>Bradycardia </b>has been reported with ALUNBRIG. Use caution when administering ALUNBRIG in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. If symptomatic bradycardia occurs, withhold ALUNBRIG and evaluate concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia. If a concomitant medication known to cause bradycardia is identified and discontinued or dose adjusted, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia; otherwise, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia. In case of life-threatening bradycardia, if no contributing concomitant medication is identified or in case of recurrence, discontinue ALUNBRIG.

<b>Visual Disturbance </b>was reported with ALUNBRIG. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms. Withhold ALUNBRIG and obtain an ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with new or worsening visual symptoms.

<b>Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation</b> has been reported with ALUNBRIG. Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Monitor CPK levels regularly during treatment. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation. Based on the severity of the CPK elevation, and if associated with muscle pain or weakness, treatment with brigatinib should be withheld, and the dose modified accordingly.

<b>Pancreatic Enzyme Elevation: </b>Elevations of amylase and lipase have been reported with ALUNBRIG. Monitor lipase and amylase regularly. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzyme elevation. Based on the severity of the laboratory abnormalities, treatment with brigatinib should be withheld, and the dose modified accordingly.

<b>Hyperglycemia: </b>Elevations of serum glucose have occurred in patients treated with ALUNBRIG. Assess fasting serum glucose prior to initiation of ALUNBRIG and monitor periodically thereafter. Antihyperglycemic medications should be initiated or optimized as needed. If cannot control hyperglycemia with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG until adequate hyperglycemic control is achieved. Upon recovery, consider reducing the ALUNBRIG dose or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity </b>Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALUNBRIG.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>

The most common adverse reactions (= 25%) reported in patients treated with ALUNBRIG at the recommended dosing regimen were increased AST, increased CPK, hyperglycaemia, increased lipase, hyperinsulinaemia, anaemia, diarrhea, increased ALT, increased amylase, anemia, nausea, fatigue, hypophosphatemia, decreased lymphocyte count, cough, rash, increased alkaline phosphatas, increased APTT, myalgia, headache, hypertension, white blood count decreased, dyspnea and vomiting.

The most common serious adverse reactions (2%) reported in patients treated with ALUNBRIG at the recommended dosing regimen other than events related to neoplasm progression included pneumonitis, pneumonia, and dyspnoea.

<b>DRUG INTERACTIONS</b>

<span class=""bwuline"">CYP3A Inhibitors:</span> Avoid concomitant use of ALUNBRIG with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG. After discontinuation of strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume ALUNBRIG dose tolerated prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor. No dose adjustment is required for ALUNBRIG in combination with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Monitor patients closely when coadminister ALUNBRIG with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice as it may also increase plasma concentrations of ALUNBRIG. Concomitant use of ALUNBRIG with moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG. After discontinuation of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, resume ALUNBRIG at the dose that was tolerated prior to the initiation of the moderate CYP3A inhibitor.

<span class=""bwuline"">CYP2C8 Inhibitors:</span> No dose adjustment is required for ALUNBRIG when coadministered with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors

<span class=""bwuline"">P-gp and BCRP Inhibitors:</span> No dose adjustment is required for ALUNBRIG coadministered with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors.

<span class=""bwuline"">CYP3A Inducers:</span> Avoid concomitant use of ALUNBRIG with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided, the dose of ALUNBRIG may be increased in 30 mg increments after 7 days of treatment with the current dose as tolerated, up to a maximum of twice the dose that was tolerated prior to the initiation of the moderate CYP3A inducer. After discontinuation of a moderate CYP3A inducer, resume the dose of ALUNBRIG to the dose that was tolerated prior to the initiation of the moderate CYP3A inducer.

<span class=""bwuline"">CYP3A Substrates:</span> Clinical drug-drug interaction studies with sensitive CYP3A substrates have not been conducted. ALUNBRIG may reduce plasma concentrations of coadministered and induce other enzymes and transporters (e.g., CYP2C, P-gp).

<span class=""bwuline"">Transporter Substrates</span>: ALUNBRIG inhibits P-gp, BCRP, OCT1, MATE1, and MATE2K in vitro. Coadministration of ALUNBRIG Transporter substrates may increase their plasma concentrations. Monitored patients closely when coadminister ALUNBRIG with substrates of these transporters with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, methotrexate).

<b>SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS</b>

<b>Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females: </b>Advised women of childbearing age not to become pregnant and advise men not to father a child during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Advised women of reproductive potential to use effective non hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Advised men with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALUNBRIG.

<b>Pregnancy: </b>ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. ALUNBRIG should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment. If used during pregnancy, or if patient becomes pregnant while taking ALUNBRIG, advise patient of the potential harm to fetus.

<b>Breast feeding: </b>There are no data regarding the secretion of ALUNBRIG in human milk. Breastfeed should be stopped during treatment with ALUNBRIG.

<span class=""bwuline"">Infertility:</span> ALUNBRIG may cause reduced fertility in males<b>.</b>

<b>Elderly Patients: </b>The limited data on the safety and efficacy of ALUNBRIG in patients aged 65 years and older suggest that a dose adjustment is not required in elderly patients. There are no available data on patients over 85 years of age.

<b>Hepatic Impairment: </b>No dose adjustment of ALUNBRIG is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class A) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class B). Reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG by approximately 50% (i.e., from 180 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg) for patients with severe renal impairment

<b>Renal Impairment: </b>No dose adjustment of ALUNBRIG is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) = 30 mL/min). The dose of brigatinib should be reduced by approximately 40% (i.e., from 180 mg to 120 mg, 120 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg) for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C

<b>Pediatric Patients: </b>The safety and efficacy of ALUNBRIG in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.

<b>ALUNBRIG IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION (U.S.)</b>

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: </b>Severe, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have occurred with ALUNBRIG. In Trial ALTA (ALTA), ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group (90 mg once daily) and 9.1% of patients in the 90?180 mg group (180 mg once daily with 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily). Adverse reactions consistent with possible ILD/pneumonitis occurred early (within 9 days of initiation of ALUNBRIG; median onset was 2 days) in 6.4% of patients, with Grade 3 to 4 reactions occurring in 2.7%. Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, etc.), particularly during the first week of initiating ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG in any patient with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, and promptly evaluate for ILD/pneumonitis or other causes of respiratory symptoms (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tumor progression, and infectious pneumonia). For Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis, either resume ALUNBRIG with dose reduction after recovery to baseline or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis or recurrence of Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis.

<b>Hypertension: </b>In ALTA, hypertension was reported in 11% of patients in the 90 mg group who received ALUNBRIG and 21% of patients in the 90?180 mg group. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 5.9% of patients overall. Control blood pressure prior to treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and at least monthly thereafter during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy. Upon resolution or improvement to Grade 1 severity, resume ALUNBRIG at a reduced dose. Consider permanent discontinuation of treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 hypertension or recurrence of Grade 3 hypertension. Use caution when administering ALUNBRIG in combination with antihypertensive agents that cause bradycardia.

<b>Bradycardia: </b>Bradycardia can occur with ALUNBRIG. In ALTA, heart rates less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) occurred in 5.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 7.6% of patients in the 90?180 mg group. Grade 2 bradycardia occurred in 1 (0.9%) patient in the 90 mg group. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor patients more frequently if concomitant use of drug known to cause bradycardia cannot be avoided. For symptomatic bradycardia, withhold ALUNBRIG and review concomitant medications for those known to cause bradycardia. If a concomitant medication known to cause bradycardia is identified and discontinued or dose adjusted, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia; otherwise, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia. Discontinue ALUNBRIG for life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified.

<b>Visual Disturbance: </b>In ALTA, adverse reactions leading to visual disturbance including blurred vision, diplopia, and reduced visual acuity, were reported in 7.3% of patients treated with ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and 10% of patients in the 90?180 mg group. Grade 3 macular edema and cataract occurred in one patient each in the 90?180 mg group. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms. Withhold ALUNBRIG and obtain an ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with new or worsening visual symptoms of Grade 2 or greater severity. Upon recovery of Grade 2 or Grade 3 visual disturbances to Grade 1 severity or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 visual disturbances<i>.</i>

<b>Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation: </b>In ALTA, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation occurred in 27% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and 48% of patients in the 90 mg?180 mg group. The incidence of Grade 3-4 CPK elevation was 2.8% in the 90 mg group and 12% in the 90?180 mg group. Dose reduction for CPK elevation occurred in 1.8% of patients in the 90 mg group and 4.5% in the 90?180 mg group. Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Monitor CPK levels during ALUNBRIG treatment. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose or at a reduced dose.

<b>Pancreatic Enzyme Elevation: </b>In ALTA, amylase elevation occurred in 27% of patients in the 90 mg group and 39% of patients in the 90?180 mg group. Lipase elevations occurred in 21% of patients in the 90 mg group and 45% of patients in the 90?180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 2.7% of patients in the 90?180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurred in 4.6% of patients in the 90 mg group and 5.5% of patients in the 90?180 mg group. Monitor lipase and amylase during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzyme elevation. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose or at a reduced dose<i>.</i>

<b>Hyperglycemia:</b> In ALTA, 43% of patients who received ALUNBRIG experienced new or worsening hyperglycemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory assessment of serum fasting glucose levels, occurred in 3.7% of patients. Two of 20 (10%) patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance at baseline required initiation of insulin while receiving ALUNBRIG. Assess fasting serum glucose prior to initiation of ALUNBRIG and monitor periodically thereafter. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as needed. If adequate hyperglycemic control cannot be achieved with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG until adequate hyperglycemic control is achieved and consider reducing the dose of ALUNBRIG or permanently discontinuing ALUNBRIG.

CEO Nader Pourhassan will appear on FOX Business Network on April 7 at 11:00 am PT to provide an update on the Company’s two COVID-19 clinical trials and 15 patients on EIND
VANCOUVER, Washington, April 07, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytoDyn Inc. (OTC.QB: CYDY), (“CytoDyn” or the “Company""), a late-stage biotechnology company developing leronlimab (PRO 140), a CCR5 antagonist with the potential for multiple therapeutic indications, announced today that it is collaborating with the U.K.’s Department
of Health to provide emergency access to leronlimab, the Company’s investigational medicine for COVID-19. The submission to Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA), an executive agency of the U.K. government sponsored by the Department of Health and Social Care, is expected to be made soon to include clinical trial sites in the
U.K. Representatives from the U.K. are coordinating with CytoDyn’s full-service international clinical research organization, Amarex Clinical Research, to prepare the requisite clinical
agreements and to prepare for timely delivery of leronlimab.
The FDA recently cleared the Company to initiate a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial for severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients for which enrollment is now underway. The Phase 2b/3 trial for severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients is for 390 patients, double blinded with 2:1 ratio (active drug to placebo ratio). Patients enrolled in this trial are expected to be administered leronlimab for two weeks with the primary endpoint being the mortality rate at 28 days and a secondary endpoint of mortality rate at 14 days. The Company will perform an interim
analysis on the data from 50 patients.
CytoDyn has initiated enrollment in a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 population in the U.S. and is enrolling in a Phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial for severe and critically ill COVID-19 population.
Nader Pourhassan, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of CytoDyn said, “We are humbled by the outpouring of inquiries and requests for access to leronlimab and are
working around the clock with our many partners to facilitate access to a potential therapeutic benefit for COVID-19 patients."" Pourhassan concluded that, ”We are working
with our CRO partner, Amarex Clinical Research, to establish similar expanded access (emergency use) programs for leronlimab for the treatment of COVID-19 with other
governmental regulatory authorities. The Amarex team is leading the clinical trial management and conduct of both Phase 2 and Phase 2b/3 projects and has done an exceptional job leading our clinical development initiative for leronlimab for the treatment of
COVID-19.”
Separately, Dr. Pourhassan will appear on Fox Business Network on April 7 at 11:00 am PT to provide a full update on the CytoDyn’s two clinical trials for COVID-19, a Phase 2 trial for
those patients with mild-to-moderate indications and a Phase 2b/3 trial for severe and critically ill patients.
About Coronavirus Disease 2019
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 disease is uncertain,
and the virus is highly contagious. COVID-19 typically transmits person to person through respiratory droplets, commonly resulting from coughing, sneezing, and close personal
contact. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals. For confirmed COVID-19 infections, symptoms have
included fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. Clinical manifestations in patients
have ranged from non-existent to severe and fatal. At this time, there are minimal treatment options for COVID-19.
About Leronlimab (PRO 140)
The FDA has granted a “Fast Track” designation to CytoDyn for two potential indications of leronlimab for deadly diseases. The first as a combination therapy with HAART for HIVinfected patients and the second is for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Leronlimab is an investigational humanized IgG4 mAb that blocks CCR5, a cellular receptor that is important in HIV infection, tumor metastases, and other diseases, including NASH. Leronlimab has completed nine clinical trials in over 800 people, including meeting its primary endpoints in a pivotal Phase 3 trial (leronlimab in combination with standard antiretroviral therapies in HIV-infected treatment-experienced patients).
In the setting of HIV/AIDS, leronlimab is a viral-entry inhibitor; it masks CCR5, thus protecting healthy T cells from viral infection by blocking the predominant HIV (R5) subtype
from entering those cells. Leronlimab has been the subject of nine clinical trials, each of which demonstrated that leronlimab could significantly reduce or control HIV viral load in
humans. The leronlimab antibody appears to be a powerful antiviral agent leading to potentially fewer side effects and less frequent dosing requirements compared with daily
drug therapies currently in use.
In the setting of cancer, research has shown that CCR5 may play a role in tumor invasion, metastases, and tumor microenvironment control. Increased CCR5 expression is an
indicator of disease status in several cancers. Published studies have shown that blocking CCR5 can reduce tumor metastases in laboratory and animal models of aggressive breast
and prostate cancer. Leronlimab reduced human breast cancer metastasis by more than 98% in a murine xenograft model. CytoDyn is, therefore, conducting a Phase 1b/2 human
clinical trial in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and was granted Fast Track designation in May 2019.
The CCR5 receptor appears to play a central role in modulating immune cell trafficking to sites of inflammation. It may be crucial in the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and other inflammatory conditions. Clinical studies by others further support the concept that blocking CCR5 using a chemical inhibitor can reduce the clinical impact of acute GvHD without significantly affecting the engraftment of transplanted bone marrow stem cells. CytoDyn is currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical study with leronlimab to support further the concept that the CCR5 receptor on engrafted cells is critical for the development of acute GvHD, blocking the CCR5 receptor from recognizing specific immune
signaling molecules is a viable approach to mitigating acute GvHD. The FDA has granted “orphan drug” designation to leronlimab for the prevention of GvHD.
About CytoDyn
CytoDyn is a late-stage biotechnology company developing innovative treatments for multiple therapeutic indications based on leronlimab, a novel humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CCR5 receptor. CCR5 appears to play a critical role in the ability of HIV to enter and infect healthy T-cells. The CCR5 receptor also appears to be implicated in tumor metastasis and immune-mediated illnesses, such as GvHD and NASH. CytoDyn has successfully completed a Phase 3 pivotal trial with leronlimab in combination with standard
antiretroviral therapies in HIV-infected treatment-experienced patients. CytoDyn plans to seek FDA approval for leronlimab in combination therapy and plans to complete the filing of
a Biologics License Application (BLA) in April of 2020 for that indication. CytoDyn is also conducting a Phase 3 investigative trial with leronlimab as a once-weekly monotherapy for HIV-infected patients. CytoDyn plans to initiate a registration-directed study of leronlimab monotherapy indication. If successful, it could support a label extension. Clinical results to date from multiple trials have shown that leronlimab can significantly reduce viral burden in people infected with HIV with no reported drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs).
Moreover, a Phase 2b clinical trial demonstrated that leronlimab monotherapy can prevent viral escape in HIV-infected patients; some patients on leronlimab monotherapy have
remained virally suppressed for more than five years. CytoDyn is also conducting a Phase 2 trial to evaluate leronlimab for the prevention of GvHD and a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial with leronlimab in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. More information is at www.cytodyn.com.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) Accepted for KEYTRUDA Monotherapy in Patients Whose Tumors Are Tumor Mutational Burden-High (TMB-H) Who Have Progressed Following Prior Treatment</b></p>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted and granted priority review for a new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy. The application seeks accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA monotherapy for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with tissue tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) =10 mutations/megabase, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of June 16, 2020.

“From the start, biomarker research has been a critical aspect of our clinical program evaluating KEYTRUDA monotherapy,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “TMB has been an area of scientific interest to help identify patients most likely to benefit from KEYTRUDA. We look forward to working with the FDA throughout the review process to help bring KEYTRUDA monotherapy to patients with cancer in the second-line or higher treatment setting, where options remain limited.”

The application was based in part on results from the Phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 trial, which also supported Merck’s 2017 FDA approval for KEYTRUDA as the first cancer treatment based on a biomarker, regardless of cancer type, in <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keytruda.com%2Fmsi-h%2F&amp;esheet=52199810&amp;newsitemid=20200407005141&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=microsatellite+instability-high&amp;index=1&amp;md5=18a01b5a0a70a9cf171227f2d2779002"" rel=""nofollow"">microsatellite instability-high</a> (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keytruda.com%2Fmsi-h%2F&amp;esheet=52199810&amp;newsitemid=20200407005141&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=MSI-H&amp;index=2&amp;md5=76539b39fe40c3de8a612dffb5bd19b8"" rel=""nofollow"">MSI-H</a>) or mismatch repair deficient (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keytruda.com%2Fmsi-h%2F&amp;esheet=52199810&amp;newsitemid=20200407005141&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=dMMR&amp;index=3&amp;md5=1b184f8ddc5bac8d8f5b21dbbfd2ee0a"" rel=""nofollow"">dMMR</a>) solid tumors.

<b>About KEYNOTE-158</b>

KEYNOTE-158 (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT02628067&amp;esheet=52199810&amp;newsitemid=20200407005141&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT02628067&amp;index=4&amp;md5=2ea6a7a1e4d0db36cd28b8656fb93142"" rel=""nofollow"">NCT02628067</a>) is a multicenter, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label trial evaluating KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks) in patients with solid tumors. Tissue TMB status was determined using the Foundation Medicine, Inc. FoundationOne<b><sup>®</sup></b>CDx assay. Tumor response was assessed every nine weeks per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 by independent, central, blinded radiographic review. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ.

<b>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</b>

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib</i>

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>

Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

<b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

<b>Adverse Reactions</b>

In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions (=20%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (28%), diarrhea (26%), rash (24%), and nausea (21%).

In KEYNOTE-002, KEYTRUDA was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 12% of 357 patients with advanced melanoma; the most common (=1%) were general physical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%). The most common adverse reactions were fatigue (43%), pruritus (28%), rash (24%), constipation (22%), nausea (22%), diarrhea (20%), and decreased appetite (20%).

</ul>
Basel, 07 April 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for its review of the New Drug Application (NDA) of risdiplam with a decision expected by August 24, 2020. The extension is a result of the recent submission of additional data by Roche, including data from the pivotal SUNFISH Part 2 study, in close collaboration with the FDA. These data were recently presented at the 2nd International Scientific and Clinical Congress on Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

In November 2019, the FDA granted Priority Review for risdiplam with a decision for approval expected by May 24, 2020. In February 2020, based on discussions with the FDA, Roche submitted additional data which could help ensure access to risdiplam for a broad range of people living with the condition, if approved. This included 12-month efficacy and safety data from the pivotal SUNFISH Part 2 study (n=180), the only placebo-controlled study ever undertaken in people aged 2-25 years with Type 2 or 3 SMA. Given the volume of additional data submitted, the FDA requires more time for review.

“We strongly believe in the potential of risdiplam as a new therapeutic option and recognize that unmet need remains in the treatment of SMA,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We are working closely with the FDA to support the review of risdiplam. Our goal is to bring this therapy to infants, children and adults living with SMA as quickly as possible.""

As part of our continued commitment to people living with SMA, Roche is pleased to announce that we have also submitted in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Russia, South Korea and Taiwan. Filing in China is imminent and we are currently on track to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency in mid-2020 as well as other international markets.

Roche leads the clinical development of risdiplam, an investigational, orally administered survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) splicing modifier for SMA, as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics. Risdiplam is being studied in a broad clinical trial programme in SMA, with patients ranging from birth to 60 years old, and includes patients previously treated with other SMA-targeting therapies. The clinical trial population is designed to represent the broad, real-world spectrum of people living with this disease with the aim of ensuring access for all appropriate patients.

<strong>About SMA
</strong>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe, inherited, progressive neuromuscular disease that causes devastating muscle atrophy and disease-related complications. It is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and one of the most common rare diseases, affecting approximately one in 11,000 babies. SMA leads to the progressive loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

SMA is caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that results in a deficiency of SMN protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and increasing evidence suggests SMA is a multi-system disorder and the loss of SMN protein may affect many tissues and cells, which can stop the body from functioning.

<strong>About risdiplam</strong>
Risdiplam is an investigational survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) splicing modifier for SMA and is an orally administered liquid. It is designed to durably increase and sustain SMN protein levels both throughout the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues of the body. It is being evaluated for its potential ability to help the SMN2 gene produce more functional SMN protein throughout the body.

Risdiplam is currently being evaluated in four multicentre trials in people with SMA:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>SUNFISH (NCT02908685) – SUNFISH is a two part, double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal study in people aged 2-25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 (n=51) determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. Part 2 (n=180) evaluated motor function using total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. MFM-32 is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. The study met its primary endpoint.</li>
 	<li>FIREFISH (NCT02913482) – an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants. The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determine the dose for Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated for 24 months, followed by an open-label extension. Enrolment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 is to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds).</li>
 	<li>JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) – an open-label exploratory trial in people with SMA aged 6 months–60 years who have been previously treated with SMA-directed therapies. The study has completed recruitment.RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) – an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study, investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in babies (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.</li>

<em><strong>Consortium led by Jenner Institute, University of Oxford </strong></em>
<em><strong>Fast-tracked clinical trial of ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 vaccine candidate starts this month</strong></em>

<strong>Oxford, UK – 8th April, 2020:</strong> Oxford Biomedica plc (LSE:OXB) (“Oxford Biomedica” or “the Group”), a leading gene and cell therapy group, announced today it has joined a Consortium led by the Jenner Institute, Oxford University, to rapidly develop, scale-up and manufacture a potential vaccine candidate for COVID-19, called ChAdOx1 nCov-19. This vaccine candidate is one of the leading vaccine candidates currently in development globally, and is expected to be the UK’s first COVID-19 vaccine in clinical trials later this month. The Consortium is led by the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford and also includes the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), Pall Life Sciences, Cobra Biologics and Halix BV.

The Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group have recruited individuals aged 18-55 from the Thames Valley area in the UK to study the vaccine’s safety and efficacy (see <a href=""https://www.covid19vaccinetrial.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.covid19vaccinetrial.co.uk/</a>). Oxford Biomedica will provide access to its large scale GMP manufacturing facilities for viral vectors, including its new Oxbox facility, to the Consortium as required, which, along with other Consortium manufacturing partners in the UK and internationally, would allow for scaled manufacturing capacity should the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate be confirmed in clinical trials.

The Oxford vaccine candidate relies on adenoviral vector technology, ChAdOx1, developed at the Jenner Institute, in Oxford. It is seen as one of the most promising vaccine technologies for COVID-19 as ChAdOx1 has been shown to generate a strong immune response from one dose and it has demonstrated a good safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical trials conducted to date. No financial terms were disclosed.

<em><strong>John Dawson, Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Biomedica, said:</strong> “As an established clinical and commercial manufacturer of viral vectors, we are very pleased to be in a strong position in terms of capacity and capabilities to support the important and urgent efforts of the Consortium led by the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, to develop and scale up manufacturing of this promising vaccine candidate for COVID-19.</em>

<em>“While our current activities on this vaccine candidate are just initiating, should the Consortium confirm there is promise for this candidate in the clinical trial initiating this month, we will play our role within the Consortium to scale up manufacturing as fast as possible. This will help to provide significant access to the vaccine candidate for further clinical trials and potentially, if approved for use, for many people in the UK and beyond.”</em>

<b>Berlin, April 8, 2020</b> – The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted approval for the new Eylea<sup>®</sup> (aflibercept) injection pre-filled syringe. This new presentation provides ophthalmologists with a more efficient and convenient way to administer EYLEA across all approved indications, as the pre-filled syringe requires fewer steps to prepare compared to the intravitreal injection procedure of the existing vial. The EC decision is applicable to all 27 European Union member states as well as the UK, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

“Eylea is the only approved anti-VEGF therapy successfully extended up to four-month (16 weeks) treatment intervals in clinical trials, and consistently delivers excellent outcomes to reduce preventable vision loss,” said Dr. Michael Devoy, Head of Medical Affairs &amp; Pharmacovigilance of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceuticals Division and Bayer Chief Medical Officer. “Together with the new pre-filled syringe presentation, which promises to benefit both physicians and patients, Bayer maintains its position as a leader in this field”.

Bayer has recently published the results from the Phase IV ALTAIR study, which confirmed the effectiveness of Eylea<sup>®</sup> (aflibercept) with Treat and Extend (T&amp;E) dosing regimens in wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The promising results demonstrated a considerable injection burden reduction, since up to 60% patients were able to achieve injection intervals of three-months (12-week interval) or more whilst more than 40% achieved injection intervals of four-months (16-week interval). Eylea is the only approved anti-VEGF to successfully extend to 16-week treatment intervals in clinical trials.

Bayer and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are collaborating on the global development of aflibercept. Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to Eylea in the U.S. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of Eylea, except for Japan where Regeneron receives a percentage of net sales. In August 2019, Regeneron received U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the pre-filled syringe for Eylea.

<b>About Eylea</b><b><sup>®</sup></b><b> (aflibercept solution for injection into the eye) and VEGF</b>
Eylea has been approved in approximately 100 countries (ex U.S.) for five indications for adults, which includes the treatment of neovascular wet AMD and the treatment of visual impairment due to: macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO; branch RVO or central RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME) and myopic choroidal neovascularization (myopic CNV). Over 31 million vials of Eylea have been sold since its launch worldwide, resulting in over four million patient-years of experience.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a naturally occurring protein in the body. Its normal role in a healthy organism is to trigger formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) supporting the growth of the body's tissues and organs. It is also associated with the growth of abnormal new blood vessels in the eye, which exhibit abnormal increased permeability that leads to edema.

Aflibercept solution for injection is a recombinant fusion protein, consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 and formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for intravitreal administration. Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and Placental Growth Factor (PGF) and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of their cognate VEGF receptors.

<p align=""left""><strong>About the Regeneron Bispecific Antibody Platform</strong>
All of Regeneron’s bispecifics are designed to closely resemble natural human antibodies and bind to two different targets. They are derived from a next-generation version of Regeneron’s proprietary <em>VelocImmune<sup>®</sup></em> technology that utilizes a proprietary genetically-engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically-humanized immune system to produce optimized fully-human antibodies and further created using the company’s <em>Veloci-Bi<sup>®</sup></em> platform. These allow for the creation of bispecifics with no linkers or artificial sequences. Additionally, Regeneron bispecifics are manufactured using similar approaches used for human antibody medicines, with similar pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p align=""left""><em>VelocImmune </em>has been used to create multiple antibodies including Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab), Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab-rwlc) and Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), which are approved in multiple countries around the world. Regeneron previously used these technologies to rapidly develop a treatment for Ebola virus infection, which is currently under review by the FDA, and is now being used in efforts to create prophylactic and treatment medicines for COVID-19.</p>
<p align=""left"">There are six Regeneron investigational bispecific antibodies currently in ongoing clinical trials for multiple blood cancers and solid tumors. These bispecifics fall into three categories:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>CD3 bispecifics</strong> are designed to bridge T-cells and tumor cells. At the tumor site, they activate T-cells via their CD3 receptors and promote T-cell killing of the cancer cells. Investigational candidates include:
°  CD20xCD3 (REGN1979) for non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas;
°  Two distinct BCMAxCD3s (REGN5458 and REGN5459) for multiple myeloma;
°  MUC16xCD3 (REGN4018) for ovarian cancer.</li>
 	<li><strong>CD28 costimulatory bispecifics</strong> are also designed to bridge T-cells and tumor cells. At the tumor site, they costimulate T-cells via their CD28 receptors and may synergize with PD-1 inhibitors and/or CD3 bispecifics. Investigational candidates include:
°  PSMAxCD28 (REGN5678) in combination with Libtayo for prostate cancer.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tumor-targeted bispecifics </strong>are designed to target proteins only on the cancer cell. In this way, they may affect various signaling pathways to hamper the cancer cell’s ability to survive and proliferate. Investigational candidates include:
°  METxMET (REGN5093) for non-small cell lung cancer that is driven by MET mutations and/or amplifications. REGN5093 targets two different parts of the MET receptor on cancer cells to degrade the receptor and block its ability to trigger cell proliferation.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""><strong>Regulatory Status of Regeneron Oncology Programs</strong>
The bispecifics mentioned in this press release are currently under clinical development, and their safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.</p>
<p align=""left"">Libtayo in combination with REGN5678 is currently under clinical development for prostate cancer, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority for this use. Libtayo is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation, and in other countries for similar indications. In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p align=""left"">As part of a global collaboration agreement, Regeneron and Sanofi are jointly developing Libtayo, as well as Regeneron's BCMAxCD3 and MUC16xCD3 bispecific programs.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>About B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) in China</strong>
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) represent a diverse group of cancers that originate from B-, T- or natural killer-cells, with annual incidence and death rates in China of more than 88,000 and 48,000, respectively, as of 2018. NHL originating in B-cells (B-NHL) make up 85% of all NHL cases, with the two most common subtypes being DLBCL and FL.</p>
<p align=""left"">DLBCL is an aggressive form of B-NHL with up to 50% of patients with advanced stage disease progressing after first-line treatment (e.g., relapsing or becoming refractory to treatment). For patients with R/R DLBCL, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor.</p>
<p align=""left"">FL is a slow-growing (indolent) form of B-NHL with most cases diagnosed in advanced stages. Although median survival ranges from 8 to 15 years in advanced FL, current therapeutic options are not curative, and most patients relapse within 5 years regardless of the regimen. In some cases, FL can transform into DLBCL, at which point it is often treated in the same way as DLBCL.</p>

Today is a historic day and a landmark moment for patients with diabetes and other serious medical conditions, as insulin and certain other biologic drugs <a title=""Deemed to be a License Patient FAQs 508c"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/135341/download"" data-entity-substitution=""media_download"" data-entity-type=""media"" data-entity-uuid=""1563196e-90e0-4ff4-a393-402c5e27f48a"">transition to a different regulatory pathway</a>. This regulatory transition, mandated by Congress and implemented by the FDA, is incredibly important for patients. For the first time, a pathway will be open for products that are proposed as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, the transitioned products. The availability of safe and effective biosimilar and interchangeable versions of these treatments, including insulin, is expected to increase patient access, adding more choices and potentially reducing costs of these vital therapies.
Biologic drugs, including insulin, treat some of the most serious diseases and conditions. The drugs transitioning today are used in the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of many of these conditions, including diabetes, respiratory distress syndrome, fertility conditions, Cushing’s syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, Gaucher disease and many more. But these life-saving drugs often also contribute significantly to drug costs. Historically, it was more difficult to develop generic versions of these drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act due to scientific challenges and limitations on the scope of data that can be relied upon in a generic drug application. This framework contributed to limited competition for these drugs, resulting in fewer choices and higher prices for patients. Today’s transition opens a new pathway for manufacturers to seek FDA approval of and bring biosimilar and interchangeable versions of insulin and other transitioning products to market, facilitating greater competition.
When Congress created the biosimilars pathway in the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, Congress also created a 10-year timeline for stakeholders to prepare for the regulatory transition of biological products that were historically regulated under the FD&amp;C Act; now that the day has arrived, the FDA can begin receiving applications for proposed biosimilars to these licensed transition biological products, including insulin products that millions of Americans rely on every day to maintain stable blood glucose. Approved biosimilars will be able to come to market, where there is incredible potential to reduce health care costs, as has been seen with increased generic drug offerings. On the generic drugs side, we know from an FDA <a title=""Generic Competition and Drug Prices"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/generic-competition-and-drug-prices"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""0f73eb74-7aa0-4dfd-8da6-b4d69613b464"">analysis</a> that even with one generic on the market, prices are 31 to 39% lower than before the generic competition. Similarly, biosimilars marketed in the U.S. typically have launched with initial list prices 15 to 35% lower than comparative list prices of the reference products.
Over the last 10 years, the FDA has worked hard to establish a strong framework for the biosimilar and interchangeable regulatory pathway, as well as providing clarity to all involved on what the transition means to them and how it may affect our many stakeholders. Our <a title=""Biosimilar Action Plan"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/114574/download"" data-entity-substitution=""media_download"" data-entity-type=""media"" data-entity-uuid=""60367505-e1e5-427d-9473-2dc8e0a4ad51"">Biosimilars Action Plan</a> was established to improve the efficiency of the biosimilar and interchangeable product development and approval process and to maximize scientific and regulatory clarity for the biosimilar product development community. Through this action plan, we’ve worked to support robust competition from biosimilars, including supporting market competition and providing clear direction to industry on many relevant topics leading up to the transition.
In just the last six months, we’ve taken several important actions on biosimilars, and in preparation for this transition, including partnering with the Federal Trade Commission regarding efforts to address false or misleading statements and promotional communications by biologic product manufacturers, deter anti-competitive business practices and support a competitive marketplace for biosimilars; issuing a final rule, draft guidance and final guidances to provide clarity to industry; providing information for patients and health care providers about what the transition means to them; and expanding and digitizing the FDA’s database of FDA-licensed biological products, otherwise known as the Purple Book.
These actions, among the many others we’ve taken in this space, reflect the tireless work of our dedicated workforce to ensure a smooth regulatory transition and provide clarity for biosimilar developers. We stand ready to review incoming applications from industry. We will also continue to work closely with those interested in producing biosimilar and interchangeable products to support efficiency in development, review and approval of these medicines.
Today is a milestone for the future of insulin and other important treatments – potentially a new era of proposed biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. We expect this regulatory transition to enable a vibrant competitive market for transitioning products, ultimately empowering patients by increasing choices and potentially lowering prices of safe, effective, high-quality medications.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Registration processes started in December 2018. During this time, a thorough examination of the drugs documentary and samples quality was carried out. According to the law, the first commercial series of the drug for sale is used for such an expertise. As a result, the Drug Agency decided to approve registration of two drugs: rituximab and trastuzumab.
Now BIOCAD is organizing the supplies, while ICM d.o.o is be responsible for distribution in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is planned to be carried out mainly through state tenders and major sales to cancer centers. The sales launch and pricing largely depend on tenders, however, upon agreement with the partner, deliveries will start this year.
“We are pleased that registration of BIOCAD medicines Acellbia and Herticad at the Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been completed. The sale of these medicines on the market of Bosnia and Herzegovina will enable significant savings in the Health Insurance Fund and at the same time enable patients to receive more effective treatment”, shared Nicola Rosic, CEO at ICM d.o.o.
According to the latest data by ICM d.o.o., the market capacity of rituximab and trastuzumab in the country is estimated around $12.7 million. The sales of Russian drugs can start already in June, allowing to decrease government costs for anti-cancer treatment. “By analyzing international markets for launching drugs, we see that our products are in demand,” said Dmitry Morozov, CEO of BIOCAD. “Therefore, in parallel, we conduct registration processes in different countries of Europe. For example, after successful registration in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are planning to gain access to the Serbian market. These are important steps towards one of the key objectives of our company: to make high-quality therapy available around the world”.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/biocad-large.jpg,Biosimilars,Biocad|ICM ,,Biosimilar|EU|Partner|Received|Registration Certificate|Two,publish,30-3-2020,2,,,,,,,,,,,,

<b>Internal research efforts</b>

More than 50 virology, protein engineering, clinical and bioprocess experts across BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D and Operations are working on this effort, using proprietary antibody discovery technology that was previously developed under an agreement with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as part of the Pandemic Preparedness Platform programme. As part of the DARPA programme, the technology enabled AstraZeneca scientists to rapidly discover potential therapeutic antibodies for influenza-A in less than 60 days.

<b>Collaborating with government and academia</b>

In addition to internal research and development, AstraZeneca is collaborating with government and academic experts to evaluate additional promising candidates for future clinical use.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences (China) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (US) are providing AstraZeneca with genetic sequences for antibodies they have discovered against SARS2-CoV-2 for further <i>in silico</i> and <i>in vitro</i> assessment.

Via collaborations with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the University of Maryland School of Medicine, promising antibodies from AstraZeneca, discovered through its internal research efforts and collaborations, will undergo preclinical safety and efficacy assessment in the organisations’ biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories.

The company is also in discussion with governments to support clinical development and manufacturing capabilities.
<b>Researching treatments for COVID-19</b>

There are currently no specific treatments for COVID-19. Researchers across the world, including AstraZeneca, are investigating preventative approaches and treatment options for COVID-19, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and antivirals, as well as investigating the repurposing of existing drugs to treat the infection.

A vaccine is a prophylaxis, or preventative, approach against disease. Vaccines require an immunisation and a healthy immune system; they have the potential to provide long-term protection against the virus, though it is estimated that it could take at least a year before a vaccine against COVID-19 is approved.

Monoclonal antibodies synthesised in the laboratory mimic natural antibodies. It is hoped that an antibody-based treatment could neutralise the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus, in theory, be given as a preventative option for those exposed to the virus, as well as treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected by the virus. An antibody-based treatment has the potential to provide immediate effect in the patient.

At AstraZeneca, we have a long history of, and deep expertise in discovering and developing antibody-based treatments for a range of diseases. The proprietary technology we are using to identify novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies has already been pressure-tested against influenza-A in response to the DARPA P3 programme. Harnessing these capabilities, our scientists are working tirelessly and collaboratively, hoping we can contribute to putting an end to this crisis as fast as we can.

<b>The process of discovering an antibody-based treatment</b>

AstraZeneca scientists are exploring three potential sources for antibodies against the <a name=""_Hlk36713863""></a>SARS CoV-2 virus – patients who have recovered from COVID-19, immunised humanised mice and laboratory techniques such as phage display.

The spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the primary target being explored for potential COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies. The aim is that by targeting the spike protein, the antibody will be able to neutralise the SARS-CoV-2 virus and affect its capacity to infect healthy cells.

AstraZeneca is harnessing its proprietary immune replica technology, developed as part of the abovementioned agreement with DARPA, which can capture and screen antibodies from millions of primary B cells. The company is also utilising hybridoma technology, which is a method for producing large numbers of monoclonal antibodies through a culture of hybrid cells that results from the fusion of B cells and immortal myeloma cells.

Once identified, the monoclonal antibodies are screened against their ability to bind to the spike protein before further developability tests are carried out. AstraZeneca is aiming for clinical evaluation in the next 3 to 5 months.

<p align=""justify"">GAITHERSBURG, Md., April 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX), a late-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced it has identified a coronavirus vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, a stable, prefusion protein made using Novavax’ proprietary nanoparticle technology, and will initiate a first-in-human trial in mid-May. Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M™ adjuvant will be incorporated with NVX-CoV2373 in order to enhance immune responses and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies.</p>
<p align=""justify"">NVX-CoV2373 was shown to be highly immunogenic in animal models measuring spike protein-specific antibodies, antibodies that block the binding of the spike protein to the receptor and wild-type virus neutralizing antibodies. High levels of spike protein-specific antibodies with ACE-2 human receptor binding domain blocking activity and SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus neutralizing antibodies were observed after a single immunization. In addition, the already high microneutralization titers seen after one dose increased eight fold with a second dose. High titer microneutralizing antibodies are generally accepted evidence that a vaccine is likely to be protective in humans.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Our scientists identified an ideal vaccine candidate selected from a number of constructs and, in partnership with Dr. Matthew Frieman, demonstrated that NVX-CoV2373 produces high levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in animal studies,” said Gregory Glenn, M.D., President of Research and Development at Novavax. “In addition, we have worked closely with our colleagues at Emergent BioSolutions to transfer our production technology that allows the manufacture of GMP vaccine for clinical trials. With preliminary CEPI funding, these heroic efforts, combined with the candidate’s excellent early results, put us in position to have preliminary human data in July.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We validated that NVX-CoV2373 generates high titer neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 virus,” said Matthew Frieman, Ph.D., Associate Professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “This is strong evidence that the vaccine created by Novavax has the potential to be highly immunogenic in humans which could lead to protection from COVID-19 and helping to control the spread of this disease.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The NVX-CoV2373 clinical development plan combines a Phase 1/Phase 2 approach to allow rapid advancement during the current coronavirus pandemic. The Phase 1 clinical trial is a placebo-controlled observer blinded study of ~130 healthy adults and includes assessment of dosage amount and number of vaccinations. The trial is expected to begin in mid-May with preliminary immunogenicity and safety results in July.</p>
<p align=""justify"">As previously announced, in March, Novavax entered into an agreement with Emergent BioSolutions to provide contract development and manufacturing services, supplying Novavax with GMP vaccine product for use in its clinical trials. This agreement offers the potential to leverage Emergent’s rapid deployment capabilities and expertise that provide Novavax scalability and capacity to produce vaccine product. Also in March, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) awarded an initial funding of $4 million to support Novavax’ efforts, with additional funding discussions ongoing.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Because of the tireless efforts and commitment of the Novavax team and our collaborators, we are preparing to initiate the NVX-CoV2373 Phase 1 trial in mid-May, weeks ahead of schedule,” said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Novavax. “This progress demonstrates the ability of our recombinant nanoparticle technology to rapidly create vaccine candidates for emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the performance of NVX-CoV2373 in multiple preclinical studies and testing gives us increased confidence in its potential to protect against COVID-19 disease.”</p>
<strong>About Coronavirus</strong>
<p align=""justify"">A new strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in late 2019 in China before beginning its rapid spread across the globe. The disease, named COVID-19, continues to cause severe pneumonia-like symptoms in many of those infected. Coronaviruses, so named for their “crown-like” appearance, are a large family of viruses that spread from animals to humans and include diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS in addition to COVID-19. While much remains unknown about the new coronavirus, it is known that the virus can spread via human-to-human transmission before any symptoms appear.</p>
<strong>About Matrix-M™</strong>
<p align=""justify"">Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant has demonstrated a potent and well-tolerated effect by stimulating the entry of antigen-presenting cells into the injection site and enhancing antigen presentation in local lymph nodes, boosting immune response.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Novavax</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq:NVAX), is a late-stage biotechnology company that promotes improved health globally through the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative vaccines to prevent serious infectious diseases and address urgent, global health needs. Novavax recently initiated development of a vaccine program against COVID-19, with human results expected in July of 2020. NanoFlu™, its quadrivalent influenza nanoparticle vaccine, met all primary objectives in its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. ResVax™, its RSV vaccine for infants via maternal immunization, is the only vaccine to demonstrate efficacy in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Novavax is a leading innovator of recombinant vaccines; its proprietary recombinant technology platform combines the power and speed of genetic engineering to efficiently produce a new class of highly immunogenic nanoparticles addressing urgent global health needs.</p>

The authors noted that “the FDA guidance is a reminder that the rules of the [Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009] should be carefully reinterpreted in order to maximize benefit, affordability, and access to insulin for all Americans with diabetes.” They note that the FDA has indicated an interest in streamlining the approval process for biosimilar insulins by removing the interchangeability requirement.
For a patient with type 1 diabetes, the cost of insulin in the US market nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, from $2864 to $5705, while the overall cost, including ancillary care, rose from $12,467 to $18,494 during that time, according to a study by the nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute published in early 2019 (<strong>Figure</strong>).
<img src=""https://biosimilar.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_image/Infographic/imgpsh_mobile_save.jpg"" alt="""" />
“This policy could play a major role in enabling robust generic competition and ensuring access to high quality, affordable insulin,” Mariana P. Socal, MD, PhD, and Jeremy A. Greene, MD, PhD, <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1916387"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">wrote</a>.
Under the current provision in the BPCIA, certain “small molecule” drugs previously approved as generics, including insulins, may be approved under the biologic regulatory pathway, but insulin biosimilars would be subject to the same rules for demonstrating interchangeability with reference medicines as other types of biosimilars.
“Regulation of insulin products has become more complicated” amid the growth of the biotech industry and the establishment of new biologic approval pathways, the authors said.
Under the small molecule pathway, proof of similarity was considered proof of interchangeability, which means pharmacists could use non-reference products without consulting physician prescribers. However, switching insulins to the biologic pathway means that biosimilar insulin manufacturers will have to conduct extra clinical trials to prove interchangeability with existing insulin products.
<strong>Years of Evidence Justify a Smoother Pathway</strong>
The authors argue that years of experience with insulins approved as generics indicate they can be safely switched without these immunogenicity tests, and further, they contend, “the complications and death caused by lack of affordable insulin are a more material threat to public health and welfare than potential differences in immunogenicity profiles” making the exception all the more critical.
Although insulin products consist of just 50 amino acids (compared with large molecule agents, which can consist of about 1300), insulin products are able to be called biologics because they require a genetically modified living organism, usually yeast or bacteria, for production.
The policy of granting interchangeability upon proof of bioequivalence has been shown to yield average price reductions of 80% within 5 years after introducing generic alternatives to the market. Insulin products currently have this designation and may lose it with the transition to the biologics approval pathway, which will make switching products to save money much more difficult for patients, the authors write.
“We believe it is crucial for an exception to be made for insulin products such that proof of similarity will be considered proof of interchangeability [under the biologics pathway],” the authors wrote.
Lowering barriers for market entry and reducing drug-development costs by forgoing extra clinical trials would promote competition among insulins and lower drug prices would help make the US insulin supply more secure, the authors said. The rise in insuling costs has been attributed to higher insulin prices in general and a shift toward more expensive insulin products.
“These benefits would accrue even if the [BPCIA pathway revision] is met with opposition from reference-product manufacturers, including those that don’t manufacture insulin but may be concerned about the precedent-setting nature of this exemption,” the authors said.
<strong>Fewer Problems With Insulin Products</strong>
One of the reasons the authors feel that interchangeability requirements should be waived is that the interchangeability difficulties for large molecule drugs, such as the potential for immunogenicity and the loss of efficacy, have not been observed with insulin products.
Additionally, antibodies that can develop for insulin users have not been observed to be associated with worrisome clinical outcomes such as changes in glucose control or dose requirements, hypoglycemia, or long-term diabetic complications, they said.
“Any harms that might stem from considering biosimilar insulins to be interchangeable with reference insulin products remain entirely theoretical,” the authors noted.
In fact, the American Diabetes Association guidelines “already acknowledge that insulin products within the same range of therapeutic onset and duration of effect…are similarly effective and can be selected at the physician’s discretion.”
Although, patients with diabetes may prefer certain products or brands, clinical research supports equivalence among treatments. Changes in insurance policies have also led to large-scale switching between insulin products, the authors note.
Another reason for an interchangeability exception for insulin is that if problems do occur, patients with diabetes will easily and quickly be able to tell. “If a biosimilar insulin product didn’t provide an adequate clinical effect, patients could identify this failure within an hour and correct it,” the authors said.
The nature of diabetes with the constant management of blood glucose levels, “mitigates any possibility of clinical failure going unnoticed.” Issues with other biologics could take months or years to notice and even when they are found, significant damage may already have been done, they said.

<span class=""xn-location"">ROCKLAND, Mass.</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">NEW YORK</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">April 9, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- EMD Serono, the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span> in the US and <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emd-serono-and-pfizer-receive-us-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-and-submit-application-for-bavencio-for-first-line-maintenance-treatment-of-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-urothelial-carcinoma-301037913.html#financial-modal"">PFE</a>) today announced completion of the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for BAVENCIO<sup>®</sup> (avelumab)* for first-line maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC). The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to BAVENCIO for this indication, and the sBLA is being reviewed by the FDA under its Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program.

The application is based on positive results from an interim analysis of the Phase III JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial, which met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). In this study, BAVENCIO plus best supportive care (BSC) as first-line maintenance therapy significantly extended the survival of patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic UC whose disease did not progress on induction chemotherapy, compared with BSC only. A statistically significant improvement was demonstrated in both co-primary populations: all randomized patients and patients with PD-L1–positive tumors. The safety profile for BAVENCIO in the trial was consistent with that in the JAVELIN monotherapy clinical development program. Detailed results from the JAVELIN Bladder 100 study will be presented at an upcoming medical congress.

""BAVENCIO is the first immunotherapy to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in a Phase III clinical trial in the first-line setting for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Chris Boshoff</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""Participation in the Real-Time Oncology Review program, coupled with the Breakthrough Therapy Designation, reflect the potential impact of BAVENCIO in this patient setting and provide the opportunity to work towards bringing this treatment option to patients as quickly as possible.""

The RTOR program is intended to create a more efficient review process to bring safe and effective treatments to patients earlier, including drugs that are likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over currently available therapy. It allows the FDA to review clinical trial data from certain applications before the complete application is formally submitted. Review under the program does not guarantee or influence the approvability of the application.<sup>1</sup>

Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a program created by the FDA to accelerate the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases where the new treatment may be a substantial improvement over available therapy. In order to receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation, preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that the drug may demonstrate a significant improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint.<sup>2</sup>

""Given the poor prognosis for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, there is an urgent need for additional treatment options that improve overall survival,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Luciano Rossetti</span>, Head of Global R&amp;D for EMD Serono. ""Our data highlight the potential for a first-line maintenance treatment approach with BAVENCIO to advance the current standard of care for previously untreated patients, and we are working with urgency toward our goal of bringing this regimen to patients.""

""For the past 30 years, chemotherapy has been the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. While this is an effective short-term option for many patients, most will ultimately experience disease progression, underscoring a need for additional treatment options,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Petros Grivas</span>, M.D., Ph.D., one of the principal investigators in the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial. ""Based on the positive overall survival results from JAVELIN Bladder 100, I believe avelumab has the potential to be practice-changing.""

In 2017, the FDA approved BAVENCIO for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response and duration of response. JAVELIN Bladder 100 is the confirmatory study for the conversion to full approval.

*BAVENCIO is under clinical investigation for the first-line maintenance treatment of advanced UC. There is no guarantee that BAVENCIO will be approved for first-line maintenance treatment of advanced UC by any health authority worldwide.

<b>About JAVELIN Bladder 100</b> <br class=""dnr"" />JAVELIN Bladder 100 (NCT02603432) is a Phase III, multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study investigating first-line maintenance treatment with BAVENCIO plus BSC versus BSC alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. A total of 700 patients whose disease had not progressed after platinum-based induction chemotherapy as per RECIST v1.1 were randomized to receive either BAVENCIO plus BSC or BSC alone. The study achieved its primary endpoint of OS in each of the co-primary populations of all randomized patients and patients with PD-L1-positive tumors. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, anti-tumor activity, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, predictive biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes in the co-primary populations. The safety profile for BAVENCIO in the trial was consistent with that in the JAVELIN monotherapy clinical development program.

<b>About Urothelial Carcinoma <br class=""dnr"" /></b>Bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer worldwide.<sup>3</sup> In 2018, there were over half a million new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed, with around 200,000 deaths from the disease globally.<sup>3</sup> UC accounts for about 90% of all bladder cancers.<sup>4</sup> This subtype becomes harder to treat as it advances, spreading through the layers of the bladder wall.<sup>5</sup>For patients with metastatic UC, the five-year relative survival rate is 5%.<sup>6</sup> Combination chemotherapy is currently the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced disease, and while a majority of patients experience high initial response rates, most patients will ultimately experience disease progression within nine months after initiation of treatment.<sup>7,8</sup> Given the poor prognosis for patients with advanced bladder cancer whose disease progresses after first-line chemotherapy, there is an urgent need for additional treatment options that improve overall survival.<sup>9</sup>

<b>About </b><b>BAVENCIO</b><b><sup>® </sup></b><b>(avelumab)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>BAVENCIO is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. BAVENCIO has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, BAVENCIO has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.<sup>10-12</sup> In <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2014</span>, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span> and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize BAVENCIO.

<b>BAVENCIO Approved Indications <br class=""dnr"" /></b>BAVENCIO<sup>®</sup> (avelumab) in combination with axitinib is indicated in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

In the US, the FDA granted accelerated approval for BAVENCIO for the treatment of (i) adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

Avelumab is currently approved for patients with MCC in 50 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.

<b>BAVENCIO Important Safety Information from the US FDA-Approved Label<br class=""dnr"" /></b>BAVENCIO can cause <b>immune-mediated pneumonitis</b>, including fatal cases.

As part of the UK Government’s announcement of a new five pillar plan to boost testing for COVID-19, GSK, AstraZeneca and the University of Cambridge have formed a joint collaboration to take action to support this national effort.

A new testing laboratory will be set up by GSK, AstraZeneca and Cambridge at the University’s Anne McLaren laboratory. This facility will be used for high throughput screening for COVID-19 testing and to explore the use of alternative chemical reagents for test kits in order to help overcome current supply shortages.

Alongside this new testing facility, GSK and AstraZeneca are working together to provide process optimisation support to the UK national testing centres in Milton Keynes, Alderley Park and Glasgow for COVID-19, providing expertise in automation and robotics to help the national testing system to continue to expand capacity over the coming weeks.

While diagnostic testing is not part of either company’s core business, we are moving as fast as we can to help where possible - with a focus on providing our world class scientific and technical expertise - working both with the Government’s screening programme and alongside the wider life sciences sector and specialist diagnostic companies.

Further updates on progress will be issued on this work in due course.

We continue to pay tribute to those working on the frontlines of this pandemic, in the UK and globally. Defeating COVID-19 requires a collective effort from everyone working in healthcare and we are committed to playing our part.

MAINZ, Germany &amp; BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech” or “the Company”), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today disclosed additional details of their collaboration to advance candidates from BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine program, previously announced on March 17, 2020.

The collaboration aims to rapidly advance multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates into human clinical testing based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA vaccine platforms, with the objective of ensuring rapid worldwide access to the vaccine, if approved. The collaboration will leverage Pfizer’s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.

The two companies plan to jointly conduct clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine candidates initially in the United States and Europe across multiple sites. BioNTech and Pfizer intend to initiate the first clinical trials as early as the end of April 2020, assuming regulatory clearance.

During the clinical development stage, BioNTech and its partners will provide clinical supply of the vaccine from its GMP-certified mRNA manufacturing facilities in Europe. BioNTech and Pfizer will work together to scale-up manufacturing capacity at risk to provide worldwide supply in response to the pandemic. BioNTech and Pfizer will also work jointly to commercialize the vaccine worldwide (excluding China, which is already covered by BioNTech’s collaboration with Fosun Pharma) upon regulatory approval.

“Combatting the COVID-19 pandemic will require unprecedented collaboration across the innovation ecosystem, with companies coming together to unite capabilities like never before,” said Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Worldwide Research, Development &amp; Medical, Pfizer. “I am proud of Pfizer’s collaboration with BioNTech and have every confidence in our ability to harness the power of science – together – to bring forth a potential vaccine that the world needs as quickly as possible.”

“We have already started working with Pfizer on our COVID-19 vaccine and are pleased to announce these further details of our ongoing collaboration, which reflects both companies’ strong commitment to move quickly to bring a safe and efficacious vaccine to patients worldwide,” says Co-Founder and CEO of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin, M.D.

Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will pay BioNTech $185 million in upfront payments, including a cash payment of $72 million and an equity investment of $113 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future milestone payments of up to $563 million for a potential total consideration of $748 million. Pfizer and BioNTech will share development costs equally. Initially, Pfizer will fund 100 percent of the development costs, and BioNTech will repay Pfizer its 50 percent share of these costs during the commercialization of the vaccine.

(TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., ""Astellas"") announced today a new drug application (NDA) for the oral once-daily therapy XOSPATA<sup>®</sup> (gilteritinib), for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed (disease that has returned) or refractory (resistant to treatment) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation (FLT3mut+), has been accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for regulatory review in China.</p>

<div style=""text-align: justify"">

<span style=""font-size: 1rem"">AML is a cancer that impacts the blood and bone marrow,</span><sup>1</sup><span style=""font-size: 1rem""> and its incidence increases with age.</span><sup>2</sup><span style=""font-size: 1rem""> It is estimated that every year, around 80,000 people in China are diagnosed with leukemia.</span><sup>3</sup><span style=""font-size: 1rem""> AML is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults.</span><sup>4</sup>

</div>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">AML patients with a FLT3 mutation have a particularly poor prognosis, with a median survival of less than six months following treatment with salvage chemotherapy.<sup>5</sup> The status of FLT3 mutation can change over the course of AML treatment, even after relapse. As such, a patient's mutation status should be determined to help inform the best treatment approach.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify""><b>About Gilteritinib
</b>Gilteritinib was discovered through a research collaboration with Kotobuki Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Astellas has exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize gilteritinib. Gilteritinib was approved in the U.S. and Japan in 2018, Europe and Canada in 2019, and Korea, Brazil and Australia thus far in 2020 for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory FLT3mut+ AML.<sup>7,8,9,10</sup><sup>,11,12,13</sup><sup> </sup>As of April 2020, gilteritinib is available in the U.S., Japan and selected countries in Europe.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Gilteritinib is a FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and has demonstrated inhibitory activity against FLT3-ITD, a type of FLT3mut+ that is seen in approximately one-third of patients with AML, as well as FLT3-TKD mutation. FLT3-ITD is a common driver mutation that presents with a high burden and poor prognosis.<sup>14</sup></p>

NeoImmuneTech, Inc., a clinical-stage T cell-focused biopharmaceutical company, today announced it has entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) to evaluate the combination of NeoImmuneTech’s NT-I7 (also known as Hyleukin-7™), a long-acting IL-7, and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo® (nivolumab), a PD-1 blocking antibody.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">The goal of the Phase 2 study is to establish safety and tolerability, and to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination in subjects with advanced or metastatic gastric, gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ), or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The results of this study will be used to further clinical development of this combination in these tumor types.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">“According to the American Cancer Society<sup>1</sup>, approximately 46,000 Americans will be diagnosed with gastric and/or esophageal cancers in 2020, and 27,200 will die from these devastating diseases,” said NgocDiep Le, M.D., Ph.D., Executive VP and Chief Medical Officer of NeoImmuneTech (NIT). “This Phase 2 trial is based on the scientific rationale and results of preclinical studies demonstrating that NT-I7, our unique T-cell amplifier, worked synergistically with checkpoint inhibitors such as Opdivo® to broaden and deepen the anti-tumor response.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Se Hwan Yang, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of NIT, added: “The clinical collaboration between NeoImmuneTech and Bristol Myers Squibb is based on our shared commitment to developing new therapeutic options that could improve outcomes for patients living with serious diseases such as gastric, GEJ or esophageal cancers. Further, it strengthens NIT’s position as pioneers of T cell-centered immuno-oncology therapeutics by focusing on enhanced clinical outcomes through a novel mechanism of action.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Under the terms of the agreement, NeoImmuneTech will be the sponsor of the trial and Bristol Myers Squibb will supply nivolumab for use in the study. While the first study will focus on gastric/GEJ/EAC cancers, under the terms of this Master Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement, the two companies may conduct additional combination trials in the future.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Opdivo® is a registered trademark of Bristol Myers Squibb.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify""><b>About NT-I7</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">NT-I7 (also known as Hyleukin-7™) is the only clinical-stage long-acting human IL-7 and is uniquely positioned to address unmet medical needs in immuno-oncology. IL-7 is a fundamental cytokine for naïve and memory T-cell development and for sustaining immune response to chronic antigens (as in cancer). NT-I7's exhibits a favorable PK/PD and safety profiles, making it an ideal combination partner for immunotherapy standard of care (SOC) such as Checkpoint Inhibitor and CAR-T therapies. NT-I7 is being studied in multiple clinical trials in solid tumors, and being planned for testing in hematologic malignancies, additional solid tumors and other immunology-focused indications.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify""><b>About NeoImmuneTech</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">NeoImmuneTech, Inc. (NIT) is a clinical-stage T cell-focused biopharmaceutical company, dedicated to expanding the horizon of immuno-oncology. NIT is led by the scientific founder and inventor of NT-I7 and complemented by a strong executive team with rich industry experience at companies such as Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, GSK, Pfizer, Amgen, Eli Lilly, MedImmune/AstraZeneca and PwC. NIT is expanding rapidly in personnel and operations, as well as partnering with industry and academic leaders to investigate NT-I7 in combination with various immunotherapeutics.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","ABBOTT PARK, Ill.,  Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced that its TriClip™ Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Repair System has received CE Mark and is now approved for use in Europe and other countries that recognize CE Mark as a non-surgical treatment for people with a leaky tricuspid valve, a condition known as tricuspid regurgitation (TR). With the CE Mark designation, Abbott’s TriClip device is the first minimally invasive, clip-based tricuspid valve repair device to be commercially available in the world. Abbott is a global leader in developing transcatheter treatments for heart valve disorders and has brought to market three first-in-class therapies for structural heart disease: MitraClip for mitral valve repair, Tendyne™ for mitral valve replacement, and now TriClip to treat the tricuspid valve.

The tricuspid valve, often referred to as the “forgotten heart valve,” has three leaflets that control the flow of blood between the two chambers on the right side of the heart. When those leaflets do not close properly, blood can flow in the reverse direction – known as regurgitation – forcing the heart to work harder. When left untreated, TR can lead to conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and ultimately, death. The condition is difficult to treat, however, and options for patients have historically been extremely limited. People with TR are typically older and suffer from multiple co-morbidities, making open-heart surgery a high-risk procedure.i

The TriClip procedure repairs the tricuspid valve without the need for open-heart surgery. The device is delivered to the heart through the femoral vein in the leg and works by clipping together a portion of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve to reduce the backflow of blood. This approach allows the heart to pump blood more efficiently, relieving symptoms of TR and improving a person’s quality of life.

“Patients suffering from severe tricuspid regurgitation are extremely ill and have very few treatment options,” said Georg Nickenig, M.D., Ph.D., professor and chief, Department of Cardiology, University Hospital, Bonn, Germany, and lead investigator of the TRILUMINATE trial, which generated strong data that helped lead to the CE Mark of TriClip. “Abbott’s TriClip could profoundly impact how physicians treat these patients. The therapy is backed by data proving safety and performance, durability, and improved patient quality of life.”

The CE Mark for TriClip follows positive six-month data from Abbott’s pivotal TRILUMINATE study examining edge-to-edge repair technique using TriClip, which was published in The Lancet in November 2019. The study demonstrated that TriClip reduced severity of TR and was associated with strong improvement in functional capacity and in quality of life at six months.

“Tricuspid regurgitation is a highly prevalent, yet seldom treated disease, which is why this approval is a significant milestone for the healthcare community. TriClip has the potential to fill a treatment gap and transform how doctors are able to help people with tricuspid regurgitation,” said Michael Dale, senior vice president of Abbott’s structural heart business. “Our clip-based technology provides clinicians a life-changing, proven safe, simple, and effective option to treat people suffering from a crippling and life-threatening disease.”

TriClip builds upon the proven success of Abbott’s MitraClip device, which treats people with leaky mitral valves, or mitral regurgitation (MR). TriClip leverages the same clip-based technology as MitraClip but has a differentiated delivery system designed specifically for delivery to the tricuspid valve.  A new, steerable guiding catheter system adapts to the right side of the heart, where the tricuspid valve resides, enabling the physician to effectively grasp and clip the leaflets of the tricuspid valve. Additionally, the TriClip device is available in two different sizes (NT and XT) to accommodate different patient anatomies.

The MitraClip system is the first and only transcatheter mitral valve therapy with more than 16 years of clinical experience and proven safety, survival and durable clinical outcomes. More than 100,000 patients have been treated worldwide with the device. Abbott also recently announced CE Mark approval of its Tendyne Transcatheter Mitral Valve Implantation System, a minimally invasive valve replacement option to add to its portfolio of mitral solutions.

 	<li><strong>Acceptance of BLA Submission for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (DAXI) in Glabellar Lines Expected Q1 2020 – </strong>In November 2019, Revance submitted its Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for DAXI in the treatment of moderate-to-severe frown lines. In the Phase 3 pivotal program, the median time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity was 24 weeks and the median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity was approximately 28 weeks. Revance anticipates acceptance of the submission in the first quarter and projects potential approval in the fourth quarter of 2020. Subject to approval, the company plans to initiate commercialization activities before year end.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><strong>New Phase 2 Trial Initiated for Treatment of Full Upper Face – </strong>In December 2019, Revance initiated a new open-label Phase 2 trial for treatment of the full upper face – glabellar (frown), lateral canthal (crow’s feet), and forehead lines combined. This trial is being conducted to understand the safety and efficacy, including potential dosing and injection patterns, of DAXI, covering the full upper face. The company expects completion of enrollment in first quarter, with topline results in fourth quarter of 2020. This trial is in addition to the existing open-label Phase 2 clinical trials that the company has already fully enrolled in forehead lines and crow’s feet.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><strong>Enrollment Completed in Phase 2 Plantar Fasciitis Trial – </strong>In December 2019, Revance enrolled the last of 155 subjects in its Phase 2 placebo-controlled clinical trial of DAXI for the management of plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is characterized by inflammation and sharp, constant pain in the heel that can become incapacitating. The company expects to report topline results for the Phase 2 trial in the second half of 2020.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><strong>Close of Public Offering of Common Stock – </strong>Revance closed its underwritten public offering of 7,475,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $17.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 975,000 additional shares. The gross proceeds to the company from the offering, before deducting the underwriters’ discounts, commissions and other estimated offering expense payable by Revance, were approximately $127.1 million, which is reflected in the unaudited January 3, 2020 cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $306.1 million. The company’s common shares outstanding was 53.4 million as of January 3, 2020.</li>
</ul>
“This is a very exciting and pivotal year for Revance, with not only a number of significant clinical data read-outs, but also the expected U.S. approval and launch of our next-generation neuromodulator product, DAXI,” said Mark Foley, President and Chief Executive Officer of Revance. “Our near-term focus is on completing the BLA approval process and finalizing our launch strategies to garner a meaningful share in the $1.4 billion* U.S. neuromodulator market. DAXI will create a new, long-lasting neuromodulator product category, delivering a premium experience that could require as few as two treatments per year and potentially provide patients with lasting, natural-looking frown line correction all year long. Although DAXI will be commercialized first in an aesthetics indication, we plan to unlock the long-term value of DAXI in an array of therapeutic indications, with clinical trials currently underway in cervical dystonia, upper limb spasticity and plantar fasciitis.<b>”</b>

<div class=""pagebody-copy"">Since COVID-19 can be transmitted through close proximity to affected individuals, public health officials have identified contact tracing as a valuable tool to help contain its spread. A number of leading public health authorities, universities, and NGOs around the world have been doing important work to develop opt-in contact tracing technology. To further this cause, Apple and Google will be launching a comprehensive solution that includes application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system-level technology to assist in enabling contact tracing. Given the urgent need, the plan is to implement this solution in two steps while maintaining strong protections around user privacy.</div>
<div class=""pagebody-copy"">First, in May, both companies will release APIs that enable interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities. These official apps will be available for users to download via their respective app stores.</div>
<div class=""pagebody-copy"">Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work to enable a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms. This is a more robust solution than an API and would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities. Privacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance in this effort, and we look forward to building this functionality in consultation with interested stakeholders. We will openly publish information about our work for others to analyse.</div>
<div class=""pagebody-copy"">All of us at Apple and Google believe there has never been a more important moment to work together to solve one of the world’s most pressing problems.

<b>- Baricitinib Research Commences in NIH-led Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial</b><b>- Lilly Starts Phase 2 Trial with Anti-Ang2 in COVID-19</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">

INDIANAPOLIS, April 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) announced today it has entered into an agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to study baricitinib as an arm in NIAID's Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial. The study will investigate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib as a potential treatment for hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19, beginning this month in the U.S.with a planned expansion to additional sites including Europe and Asia. Results are expected within the next two months.

Baricitinib, an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor marketed as OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup>, is approved in more than 65 countries as a treatment for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. The U.S. prescribing information includes boxed warnings regarding the use of baricitinib, including warnings about risk for developing serious infections, a risk that may be related to baricitinib's effects on the immune system. Given the inflammatory cascade seen in COVID-19, baricitinib's anti-inflammatory activity has been hypothesized to have a potential beneficial effect in COVID-19 and warrants further study in patients with this infection.

Joining the NIAID study is just one approach Lilly is taking to tackle the COVID-19 global health crisis. Lilly is also announcing today that it will advance LY3127804, an investigational selective monoclonal antibody against Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2), to Phase 2 testing in pneumonia patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who are at a higher risk of progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Ang2 is known to be elevated in ARDS patients and Lilly will test whether inhibiting the effects of Ang2 with a monoclonal antibody can reduce the progression to ARDS or the need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients. This trial will begin later this month at several U.S. centers.

""Lilly is moving at top speed and using all available resources to help fight this pandemic,"" said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. ""Developing potential therapeutic medicines for COVID-19 is part of our vital and humanitarian mission. To be successful, we must combine resources, data and expertise, with government, academia and other companies. We look forward to seeing the results of baricitinib and anti-Ang2 clinical studies.""

""There is an urgent need for new strategies to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients, many of whom will progress to respiratory failure,"" said Vincent C. Marconi, M.D., professor of medicine and global health at Emory University School of Medicine, one of the U.S. sites for NIAID's ongoing Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial. ""This NIAID study presents an important opportunity to test whether baricitinib can help these patients.""

Lilly currently does not anticipate shortages for any of its medicines, including baricitinib, which remains widely available in countries where it is approved. Should research efforts for baricitinib in COVID-19 prove successful, Lilly will continue to create adequate supply to support both appropriate clinical and investigational use.

<b>Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients
</b>OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup> (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS</b><b> </b>

<b>WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS
<i>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</i>: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.</b>

<b>Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.</b>

<b><i>MALIGNANCIES</i>: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.</b>

<b><i>THROMBOSIS</i>: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.</b>

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS: </b>The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>with chronic or recurrent infection</li>
 	<li>who have been exposed to TB</li>
 	<li>with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection</li>
 	<li>who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or</li>
 	<li>with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.</li>
</ul>
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

<b>Tuberculosis </b>– Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

<b>Viral Reactivation</b> – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

<b>MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS:</b> Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

<b>THROMBOSIS</b><b>:</b> Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

<b>GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: </b>Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

<b>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:
</b><b><i>Neutropenia</i></b> – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

<b><i>Lymphopenia</i></b> – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

<b><i>Anemia</i></b> – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to &lt;8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

<b><i>Liver Enzyme Elevations</i></b> – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to =5x and =10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

<b><i>Lipid Elevations</i></b> – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

<b>VACCINATIONS</b>:  Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</b>Adverse reactions (=1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.

<b>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

</b><b>About OLUMIANT<sup>®
</sup></b>OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies, and approved outside of the U.S. for patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs.<sup>i</sup> There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.<sup>ii</sup> OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.<sup>i</sup>

In December 2009, Lilly and Incyte announced an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of baricitinib and certain follow-on compounds for patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

<p class=""m_text"">LAKEWOOD, CO. USA - April 10, 2020 - Terumo BCT, Inc. and Marker Therapeutics AG announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of Terumo BCT's Spectra Optia™ Apheresis System combined with Marker Therapeutics' D2000 Adsorption Cartridge to treat patients 18 years of age or older with confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.</p>
<p class=""m_text"">The devices work together by reducing the number of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, i.e., small active proteins in the bloodstream that control a cell's immune response by filtering the blood and returning the filtered blood to the patient. The proteins that are removed are typically elevated during infections and can be associated with a ""cytokine storm"" that occurs in some COVID-19 patients, leading to severe inflammation, rapidly progressive shock, respiratory failure, organ failure and death.</p>
<p class=""m_text"">""We thank the Food and Drug Administration for their expedited review, which provides another treatment option for patients in the ICU to help reduce the severity of the disease,"" say Antoinette Gawin, CEO and President of Terumo BCT, and David Cohen, Chairman of Marker.</p>

<h3><b><i>First medicine approved to treat this rare and debilitating genetic condition
</i></b></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the kinase inhibitor <i>Koselugo</i> (selumetinib) for the treatment of paediatric patients two years of age and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN).<sup>1</sup>

The approval by the FDA was based on positive results from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP)-sponsored Phase II SPRINT Stratum 1 trial coordinated by the NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, Pediatric Oncology Branch. This is the first regulatory approval anywhere in the world of a medicine for the treatment of NF1 PN.<sup>1</sup>

NF1 is a rare and debilitating genetic condition.<sup>2</sup> Some 30-50% of patients with NF1 experience PN – tumours growing inside their nerve sheaths. These PN can cause clinical issues such as pain, motor dysfunction, airway dysfunction, bowel/bladder dysfunction and disfigurement.<sup>2,3</sup>

Results showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 66% (33 of 50 patients, confirmed partial response) in paediatric patients with NF1 PN when treated with <i>Koselugo</i> as a twice-daily oral monotherapy. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed complete or partial response of at least 20% reduction in tumour volume.

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “For the first time, patients and families impacted by this incurable genetic condition have an approved medicine to treat the resulting plexiform neurofibromas. I would like to thank our research partners, the NCI, the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP), the Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), the NF1 patient community and, most importantly, the children, parents and doctors who participated in the SPRINT clinical trial programme.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “Previously there were no medicines approved for this disease. This approval has the potential to change how symptomatic, inoperable NF1 plexiform neurofibromas are treated and provides new hope for these patients.”

Brigitte C. Widemann, M.D., Principal Investigator of the SPRINT trial and Chief, National Cancer Institute Pediatric Oncology Branch, said: “<i>Koselugo</i> has made a difference for many children in this trial. This is an important treatment advance for patients and their families.”

AstraZeneca and MSD are jointly developing and commercialising <i>Koselugo</i> globally and submitted a marketing authorisation application in NF1 PN to the European Medicines Agency in the first quarter of 2020. Further global regulatory submissions are being evaluated.

<b>Priority Review Voucher</b>

AstraZeneca has received a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) under the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/industry/developing-products-rare-diseases-conditions/rare-pediatric-disease-rpd-designation-program"" rel=""link-confirmation"">Rare Pediatric Disease Designation Program</a> intended to encourage development of new medicines for rare paediatric diseases. A PRV entitles the holder to FDA Priority Review of a single New Drug Application or Biologics License Application, which reduces the target review time and has led to an expedited approval.

<b>Financial considerations</b>

In accordance with the existing collaboration agreement between Merck and AstraZeneca, following approval and upcoming launch, AstraZeneca will book all monotherapy Product Sales of <i>Koselugo</i>; half of gross profits will be due to Merck and will be recorded under Cost of Sales. Any potential future sales-related milestone payments will be recorded under Collaboration Revenue. AstraZeneca will supply <i>Koselugo</i>.

<b>NF1</b>

NF1 is a debilitating genetic condition that affects one in every 3,000 to 4,000 individuals.<sup>4</sup> It is caused by a spontaneous or inherited mutation in the NF1 gene and is associated with many symptoms, including soft lumps on and under the skin (cutaneous neurofibromas) and skin pigmentation (so-called ‘café au lait’ spots)<sup>2 </sup>and, in 30-50% of patients, tumours develop on the nerve sheaths (plexiform neurofibromas). These plexiform neurofibromas can cause clinical issues such as disfigurement, motor dysfunction, pain, airway dysfunction, visual impairment, and bladder/bowel dysfunction.

PN begin during early childhood, with varying degrees of severity, and can reduce life expectancy by up to 15 years.<sup>2,4</sup>

<b>SPRINT</b>

The SPRINT Phase I/II trial was designed to evaluate the objective response rate and impact on patient-reported and functional outcomes in paediatric patients with NF1-related inoperable PNs treated with <i>Koselugo</i> monotherapy.<sup>1</sup> Results were published in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912735"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a><i><u>.</u></i><sup>5</sup> This trial sponsored by NCI CTEP was conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between NCI and AstraZeneca with additional support from NTAP.

<b><i>Koselugo</i></b>

<i>Koselugo</i> (selumetinib) is inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2). MEK1/2 proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. Both MEK and ERK are critical components of the RAS-regulated RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, which is often activated in different types of cancers.

<i>Koselugo</i> was granted US FDA <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2019/selumetinib-granted-us-breakthrough-therapy-designation-in-neurofibromatosis-type-1-01042019.html"">Breakthrough Therapy Designation</a> in April 2019, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in December 2019, Orphan Drug Designation in February 2018, <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2018/selumetinib-granted-orphan-designation-in-europe-for-neurofibromatosis-type-1-03082018.html"">EU orphan designation</a> in August 2018 and Swissmedic Orphan Drug Status in December 2018 for the treatment of paediatric patients with NF1 PN.

<b>AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration</b>

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise <i>Lynparza</i>, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and <i>Koselugo</i>, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i>and <i>Koselugo</i> in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and <i>Koselugo</i> in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

<span class=""xn-location"">LAVAL, Quebec</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">April 13, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC) (""Bausch Health"" or the ""Company"") today announced it has initiated a clinical trial program in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> evaluating an investigational use of VIRAZOLE® (Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP) in combination with standard of care therapy to treat hospitalized adult patients with respiratory distress due to COVID-19. Because ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside that works to stop viral replication, VIRAZOLE may be effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19 infection.

VIRAZOLE is currently approved in several countries around the world, including <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, for the treatment of hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

The initial clinical study has been approved by Health Canada and is expected to begin within the next few weeks. The Company is also in discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and health authorities in multiple countries regarding additional studies to evaluate VIRAZOLE as a treatment for COVID-19 infection. The Bausch Foundation is also continuing to work directly with health authorities in <span class=""xn-location"">Italy</span> to make VIRAZOLE for inhalation available free of charge in compassionate use in Italian hospitals.

""VIRAZOLE has demonstrated antiviral activity in treating severe pediatric respiratory infections, and we believe it may be a valuable agent in reducing respiratory distress in adults suffering from COVID-19. We are actively pursuing approval of our trial protocol around the world to test the efficacy and safety of VIRAZOLE in this patient population,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Joseph C. Papa</span>, chairman and CEO, <span class=""xn-person"">Bausch Health</span>. ""Bausch Health will remain focused – for as long as necessary – on doing our part to help end this unprecedented global health pandemic, including donating our health care products, conducting research to find new treatment options and supporting patients, health care providers and our employees.""

The initial study protocol is an open label, interventional trial that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VIRAZOLE in hospitalized adult patients, aged 18 or older, who have tested positive for COVID-19, and as a result of their infection, have significant respiratory distress. Two active study arms will compare different dosing regimens of VIRAZOLE in combination with standard of care therapy.

<b>About </b><b>VIRAZOLE® <br class=""dnr"" /></b>VIRAZOLE (ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP) aerosol is indicated only for lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV. Treatment may be initiated while awaiting rapid diagnostic test results. However, treatment should not be continued without documentation of RSV infection.

VIRAZOLE is not approved by Health Canada for use in COVID-19 patients.

Limited clinical data indicate that VIRAZOLE administered as a small particle aerosol may be beneficial in the treatment of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in neonates and infants when associated with underlying cardiovascular, pulmonary or immune deficiency. Treatment should be confined to hospitalized patients, and administration should be continuous during the period of therapy apart from the time required for ancillary care of the patient. Only severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection is to be treated with VIRAZOLE aerosol.

VIRAZOLE aerosol treatment must be accompanied by and does not replace standard supportive respiratory and fluid management for infants and children with severe respiratory tract infection.

Use of VIRAZOLE aerosol is contraindicated in women or girls who are or may become pregnant during exposure to the drug. VIRAZOLE may cause fetal harm, and respiratory syncytial virus infection is self-limited in this population. VIRAZOLE is not completely cleared from human blood even four weeks after administration. Although there are no pertinent human data, VIRAZOLE has been found to be teratogenic and/or embryolethal in nearly all species in which it has been tested; however, pregnant baboons given up to 120 mg/kg/day of ribavirin over a 4-day period within the 20 days of organogenesis during gestation failed to exhibit any teratogenic effect.

<b>WARNINGS<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Close monitoring of patients and respiratory equipment must be guaranteed when VIRAZOLE is used in infants requiring assisted ventilation. Precipitation of VIRAZOLE powder in respiratory equipment may interfere with safe and effective patient ventilation.

Bronchospasm was observed in a tolerance study with ribavirin aerosol in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.

Respiratory function should be carefully monitored during treatment. If initiation of VIRAZOLE aerosol treatment appears to produce sudden deterioration of respiratory function, treatment should be stopped and only reinstituted with caution and continuous monitoring.

Although VIRAZOLE is not indicated in adults, the physician should be aware that it is teratogenic in animals.

VIRAZOLE administered by aerosol produced cardiac lesions in mice and rats after 30 and 36 mg/kg, respectively, for 4 weeks, and after oral administration in monkeys at 120 mg/kg and rats at 154 to 200 mg/kg for 1 to 6 months. VIRAZOLE aerosol administered to developing ferrets at 60 mg/kg for 10 or 30 days resulted in inflammatory and possibly emphysematous changes in the lungs. Proliferative changes were seen at 131 mg/kg for 30 days. The significance of these findings to human administration is unknown.

VIRAZOLE lyophilized in 6 gram vials is intended for use as an aerosol only.

It has been noted that ribavirin has shown some evidence of mutagenesis in some in vitro test systems. Carcinogenicity studies are incomplete and inconclusive. Some evidence for the production of benign tumors has been shown.

<b>PRECAUTIONS<br class=""dnr"" /></b>VIRAZOLE has been in use for many years in human beings without any reported adverse effects in human fetuses. However, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, and there is little published evidence of its safety in the early stages of human pregnancy. Since VIRAZOLE is delivered in aerosolized form and because of known teratogenic effects in animals, pregnant women should not care for patients receiving VIRAZOLE, although human teratogenic effects have not been proven.

Patients with lower respiratory tract infection due to respiratory syncytial virus require optimum monitoring and attention to respiratory and fluid status.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The safety data from patients treated with VIRAZOLE aerosol has been carefully evaluated in 26 studies. Bronchospasm was observed in a tolerance study with VIRAZOLE aerosol (20 mg/mL) in adults. One of six adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and two of six asthmatic adults became dyspneic during the period of VIRAZOLE aerosol administration. These patients required chronic administration of bronchodilators which were discontinued 24 hours prior to VIRAZOLE treatment. An inhalation of a bronchodilator by puffer produced symptomatic relief and return to baseline conditions.

Several serious adverse events occurred in severely ill infants with life-threatening underlying diseases, many of whom required assisted ventilation. These events include: worsening of respiratory status, bacterial pneumonia and pneumothorax. The role of VIRAZOLE in these events is indeterminate.

There were nineteen deaths during or shortly after treatment with VIRAZOLE aerosol. No death was attributed to ribavirin aerosol by the investigators.

Some subjects requiring assisted ventilation have experienced serious difficulties, which may jeopardize adequate ventilation and gas exchange. Precipitation of drug within the ventilatory apparatus, including the endotracheal tube, has resulted in increased positive end expiratory pressure and increased positive inspiratory pressure. Accumulation of fluid in tubing (""rain out"") has also been noted.

Although anemia has not been reported with use of the aerosol, it occurs frequently with oral and intravenous ribavirin, and most infants treated with the aerosol have not been evaluated 1 or 2 weeks post-treatment when anemia is likely to occur. Reticulocytosis has been reported with aerosol use.

Conjunctivitis has been reported in controlled studies with VIRAZOLE aerosol, however, no significant difference was observed between VIRAZOLE treated and control groups.

The deal is anchored by Blackstone’s purchase of 50 percent of the royalties owed to Alnylam on global sales of inclisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Inclisiran is a twice-a-year, subcutaneously injected RNAi therapeutic that has been shown in a comprehensive Phase 3 program to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad” cholesterol with an acceptable safety profile. If approved, this medicine is expected to help patients lower LDL cholesterol, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the U.S. and globally.

The strategic financing collaboration, led by Blackstone Life Sciences and GSO Capital Partners (“GSO”), Blackstone’s credit platform, is expected to enable Alnylam’s achievement of a self-sustainable financial profile without need for future equity financing, accelerating the commercial potential of Alnylam’s rapidly advancing product portfolio. The investment by multiple Blackstone businesses will support the development and delivery of promising medicines to the patients who need them and is one of the largest ever private financings of a biotech company.

The transaction includes the inclisiran royalty monetization, corporate debt, purchase of Alnylam equity, and funding for certain R&amp;D activities related to the clinical advancement of two Alnylam investigational RNAi therapeutic programs in cardiovascular disease.

Specifically, the transaction is comprised of the following components:
<ol class=""bwlistdecimal"">
 	<li>$1 billion in committed payments, led by Blackstone Life Sciences, to acquire 50 percent of Alnylam’s royalties and commercial milestones for inclisiran;</li>
 	<li>Up to $750 million in a first lien senior secured term loan led by GSO;</li>
 	<li>Up to $150 million from Blackstone Life Sciences for development of Alnylam’s cardiometabolic programs vutrisiran and ALN-AGT (to be established based upon a non-binding letter of intent);</li>
 	<li>$100 million purchase of Alnylam common stock.</li>
</ol>
“Alnylam is focused on building a top-tier biopharmaceutical company, advancing RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of medicines with transformative potential for patients around the world. This exciting new relationship with Blackstone brings us much closer to that goal, securing our bridge towards a self-sustainable financial profile that we believe can now be achieved without any need for Alnylam to access the equity markets in the future,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “A central component of this strategic relationship is a partial monetization of our royalty for inclisiran. If approved, we believe this therapy holds enormous promise as a potential game-changer in hypercholesterolemia management. We are pleased to retain half of the royalties we receive from Novartis, allowing Alnylam to benefit from inclisiran’s anticipated future success. We couldn’t be more pleased to enter into this highly innovative arrangement with Blackstone, which has shown a significant commitment to Alnylam’s future and alignment with our long-term vision.”

“Blackstone is uniquely positioned to provide customized, one-stop-shop financing solutions at scale while establishing development collaborations with the world’s leading biotech companies. Alnylam’s RNAi technology represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today, and aligns perfectly with our investment strategy,” said Nicholas Galakatos, Ph.D., Global Head of Blackstone Life Sciences. “Our collaboration with Alnylam provides non-dilutive access to capital to advance important new medicines in development across several disease indications including heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. and globally.”

“We’re thrilled to be able to partner with Blackstone Life Sciences to provide a customized solution for Alnylam, whose approved therapies provide important new options for patients,” said Dwight Scott, Global Head of GSO. “GSO’s capital will support Alnylam during a period of global growth as it continues to launch its medicines and pursue innovative RNAi approaches to bring new therapies to market and ultimately to patients around the globe.”

Alnylam, an existing tenant of Blackstone Real Estate company BioMed Realty, is also in discussions with BioMed to expand its footprint in Cambridge, MA.

<b>About Inclisiran
</b>Inclisiran, an investigational cholesterol-lowering treatment, was added to the Novartis pipeline via its acquisition of The Medicines Company. Inclisiran will potentially be the first and only LDL-C lowering siRNA treatment. It is intended to be administered by a healthcare professional by subcutaneous injection with an initial dose, again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter. Its twice-yearly dosing by subcutaneous injection may integrate seamlessly into a patient’s healthcare routine. As a siRNA, inclisiran is thought to harness the body’s natural process of clearing LDL-C from the bloodstream. Inclisiran is a double-stranded siRNA, conjugated on the sense strand with triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to facilitate uptake by hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, inclisiran increases LDL-C receptor recycling and expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, thereby increasing LDL-C uptake by hepatocytes and lowering LDL-C levels in the circulation. Data from each of the Phase III studies was recently published online, ahead of print, in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORION-4, is ongoing.

In the Phase III studies, inclisiran was reported to be well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo. The most common adverse reactions reported (=3% of patients treated with inclisiran and occurring more frequently than placebo) were, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, back pain, dyspnea, bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infection. Adverse events at the injection site were more frequent with inclisiran than placebo and were generally mild and none were severe or persistent.

Novartis has obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize inclisiran under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.

<b>About RNAi
</b>RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

BENGALURU, India and HERTFORDSHIRE, England/PITTSBURGH: April 14, 2020
Biocon Ltd. (BSE code: 532523, NSE: BIOCON) and Mylan N.V. today announced the launch of Fulphila® , a biosimilar to Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) in Australia. Fulphila is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for the treatment of cancer patients following chemotherapy, to decrease the duration of severe neutropenia and so reduce the incidence of infections, as manifested by febrile neutropenia. Fulphila is now available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The approval of Fulphila was based on a comprehensive package of analytical, nonclinical and clinical data, which confirmed that the product is highly similar to Neulasta and no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and efficacy exist.
Dr Christiane Hamacher, CEO, Biocon Biologics said, “We are extremely pleased to enable access to our high quality, affordable biosimilar pegfilgrastim for patients in Australia. Fulphila, co-developed by Biocon Biologics and Mylan, is the third biosimilar to be commercialized in Australia and we hope that continued penetration of our biosimilars will enable higher cost savings for the Australian healthcare system. We are committed to use our science, scale and expertise to shift the access paradigm for patients in need of biosimilars like pegfilgrastim across the globe.”
Mylan Australia Country Manager, Sylvain Vigneault, commented, “Mylan is proud to launch Fulphila, the third biosimilar to be offered through the Mylan-Biocon Biologics partnership in Australia, as part of its commitment to expand access to more affordable medicines. Biosimilars ensure patients have timely and affordable access to quality, safe and effective treatments in a way that is sustainable for the
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Globally, Mylan is a leader in biosimilars with one of the largest and most diverse biosimilars portfolios which includes 20 biosimilar and insulin analog products in development or on the market. We’re pleased to continue to bring this experience and expertise to patients in Australia.”  2
A suite of patient services will be available at launch to further support patients and caregivers with treatment. Fulphila, co-developed by Biocon Biologics and Mylan, was the first biosimilar pegfilgrastim to be approved in the U.S. and was successfully launched in July 2018, thus expanding access for patients in need of an affordable alternative. Fulphila has received regulatory approval in more than 30 countries around the world. More affordable treatment options such as biosimilars for healthcare providers and
their patients enable savings for healthcare systems around the world, including the PBS in Australia.
The Australian government recognises the importance of driving biosimilar uptake to create a competitive and sustainable biosimilars market. In 2015, they committed to the Biosimilar Awareness Initiative and in 2018 they increased their commitment by supporting the Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association through a $5 million grant to undertake not only increased education around biosimilars in general, but also activities that further promote the appropriate prescribing, dispensing and use of
biosimilar medicines.
Biocon Biologics’ scientific expertise and world-class R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities have enabled it to bring multiple biosimilar therapeutics to the US and Europe. It has a product pipeline of 28 molecules, including 11 with Mylan, several with Sandoz, and is developing many independently.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

INCHEON, Korea--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Celltrion Group today announced that the company has successfully selected the most potent antibody candidates to neutralise SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.

Through a partnership with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), Celltrion initially identified and secured 300 different types of antibodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 antigen. These were then screened based on their ability to bind to the virus spike protein. Celltrion was then able to capture a total of 38 potent neutralising antibodies, of which, 14 are powerful neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Following the selection of antibody candidates which demonstrate high potency in neutralising SARS-CoV-2, Celltrion will begin cell-line development. Once this is completed, Celltrion aims to roll out mass production of the therapeutic antibody and, together with the KCDC, Celltrion will conduct efficacy and toxicity testing in mice and non-human primates.

Ki-Sung Kwon, Head of R&amp;D Unit at Celltrion said, “We are bringing our full resources and expertise to overcome this global health crisis and are glad to have identified these antibodies sooner than previously expected. These antibodies can recognise multiple epitopes, thus increasing the probability of nonspecific antigen binding. Given the expedited development process of our antiviral antibody treatment, we anticipate moving to first-in-human clinical trials in July. We are also on track with the development of a ‘super antibody’ or ‘an antibody cocktail’ and the launch of a rapid self-testing diagnostic kit in the summer of this year.”

<b>About COVID-19<sup>1</sup></b>

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of viruses that lead to illnesses from the common cold to severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).

<strong>FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J., April 13, 2020</strong> /<a href=""https://www.bd.com/.xml"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for an additional molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19 that can return results in two to three hours. The new test also has been CE marked to the IVD Directive (98/79/EC).

The test, which is run on the BD MAX<sup>™</sup> System, provides additional testing capacity for COVID-19 in the United States and in countries that recognize the CE Mark to test patients and health care workers. The test is in addition to the other tests already available on the BD MAX<sup>™</sup> System from collaborations with BioGX and CerTest and is based on the CDC assay design. The BD MAX<sup>™</sup> System, a molecular diagnostic platform, is already in use at thousands of laboratories worldwide, and each unit is capable of analyzing hundreds of samples over a 24-hour period.
<div class=""col-sm-4"">

<p class=""img-wrap""></p>

</div>
</div>
""The new BD COVID-19 test for the BD MAX<sup>™</sup> System will help increase availability of these much-needed tests around the world,"" said Dave Hickey, president of Integrated Diagnostics for BD. ""We continue to work towards a full portfolio of testing options to give health care workers choice and access to the right test for the right situation.""

The majority of BD MAX<sup>™</sup> Systems are installed in hospital laboratories, reducing the added time and complexity of needing to send samples to a reference lab. The system is fully automated, reducing the opportunity for human error and increasing the speed to result, and can process 24 samples simultaneously. The assay is based on the same viral RNA targeting sequences and real-time PCR detection method as the test developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Hospitals and laboratories that use a BD MAX<sup>™</sup> System can order tests through their BD sales representative.

The BD SARS-CoV-2 Reagent Kit for BD MAX<sup>™</sup> System has been CE marked to the IVD Directive (98/79/EC), but it has not been cleared or approved by FDA. The test has been authorized by FDA under an EUA only for the detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 virus to aid in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. It has not been authorized for use to detect any other viruses or pathogens. The test is authorized in the United States for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

<strong>PARIS and LONDON – April 14, 2020 </strong>- Sanofi and GSK today announce that they have signed a letter of intent to develop an adjuvanted vaccine for COVID-19, using innovative technology from both companies, to help address the ongoing pandemic.

Sanofi will contribute its S-protein COVID-19 antigen, which is based on recombinant DNA technology. This technology has produced an exact genetic match to proteins found on the surface of the virus, and the DNA sequence encoding this antigen has been combined into the DNA of the baculovirus expression platform, the basis of Sanofi’s licensed recombinant influenza product in the US.

GSK will contribute its proven pandemic adjuvant technology. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protect more people.

<em>“As the world faces this unprecedented global health crisis, it is clear that no one company can go it alone<a name=""_Hlk37155291""></a>.” </em>says Paul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi<em>. “That is why Sanofi is continuing to complement its expertise and resources with our peers, such as GSK, with the goal to create and supply sufficient quantities of vaccines that will help stop this virus.”</em>

<em>“This collaboration brings together two of the world’s largest vaccines companies.” </em>says Emma Walmsley, Chief Executive Officer, GSK<em>. “By combining our scientific expertise, technologies and capabilities, we believe that we can help accelerate the global effort to develop a vaccine to protect as many people as possible from Covid-19.”</em>

The combination of a protein-based antigen together with an adjuvant is well-established and used in a number of vaccines available today. An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to enhance the immune response and has been shown to create a stronger and longer- lasting immunity against infections than the vaccine alone. It can also improve the likelihood of delivering an effective vaccine that can be manufactured at scale.

The companies plan to initiate phase I clinical trials in the second half of 2020 and, subject to regulatory considerations, aim to complete the development required for availability by the second half of 2021.

As previously announced by Sanofi, development of the recombinant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate is being supported through funding and a collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The companies plan to discuss funding support with other governments and global institutions prioritising global access.

<em>“Strategic alliances among vaccine industry leaders are essential to make a coronavirus vaccine available as soon as possible,” says </em>BARDA Director, Rick A. Bright, Ph.D. “<em>Development of the adjuvanted recombinant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate holds the potential to lower the vaccine dose to provide vaccine to a greater number of people to end this pandemic, and help the world become better prepared or even prevent future coronavirus outbreaks.”</em>

The companies have set up a Joint Task Force, co-chaired by David Loew, Global Head of Vaccines, Sanofi and Roger Connor, President Vaccines, GSK. The taskforce will seek to mobilize resources from both companies to look for every opportunity to accelerate the development of the candidate vaccine.

Considering the extraordinary humanitarian and financial challenge of the pandemic, both companies believe that global access to COVID-19 vaccines is a priority and are committed to making any vaccine that is developed through the collaboration affordable to the public and through mechanisms that offer fair access for people in all countries.

These efforts mark a significant milestone in Sanofi’s and GSK’s ongoing contributions to help fight COVID-19. The companies have entered into a Material Transfer Agreement to enable them to start working together immediately.  Full terms of the collaboration will be finalised over the next few weeks.

""This authorization allows for an alternative method to administer continuous nebulized medications to patients who are critically ill with COVID-19, many of whom are on ventilation,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Wes Cetnarowski</span>, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President, Scientific Affairs at B. Braun. ""As hospitals struggle to cope with the surge of patients suffering from this deadly disease, this action provides another tool for healthcare professionals on the front line to treat some of the most serious cases while helping to protect clinicians by reducing their exposure to infected patients.""

</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

Studies have shown that using infusion pumps with nebulizers can help provide steady, controlled delivery of nebulized medication to patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some of the most critical COVID-19 patients suffer from severe ARDS.

""We applaud this decisive action taken by the FDA to help some of the most seriously ill COVID-19 patients,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jean-Claude Dubacher</span>, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of B. Braun Medical Inc. ""The rapid review and authorization of this and other COVID-19 countermeasures demonstrate the agency's commitment to ensure that healthcare providers have the medical devices and treatments they need to fight this disease.""

The EUA also authorizes ground medical transport use of the Infusomat® Space Volumetric Infusion Pump System. The Perfusor® Space Syringe Infusion Pump System is already cleared for ground transport.

B. Braun submitted the EUA request to FDA on <span class=""xn-chron"">April 8, 2020</span> under the agency's <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2017</span> ""Guidance for Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities,"" which enhances FDA's authority to support emergency preparedness and response and foster the development and availability of medical products for use in public health emergencies.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 14, 2020-- <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alnylam.com%2F&amp;esheet=52202947&amp;newsitemid=20200414005125&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Alnylam+Pharmaceuticals%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=44a12451eb43167f006ece1fadb40619"" rel=""nofollow"">Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</a> (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to vutrisiran, an investigational therapeutic for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis in adults. According to the FDA, Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. With this designation, Alnylam will be eligible to submit a rolling New Drug Application for vutrisiran.

“Vutrisiran has demonstrated an encouraging safety profile in the Phase 1 study, with infrequent quarterly dosing with low-volume, subcutaneous administration which potentially reduces the burden of care for this progressive, life-threatening and multisystem disease. We are therefore pleased that the FDA has granted vutrisiran Fast Track designation,” said Rena Denoncourt, Vutrisiran Program Leader at Alnylam. “After completing enrollment earlier this year, we look forward to sharing topline results of the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in early 2021. More broadly, we remain committed to developing additional therapeutic options for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis to augment the market-leading position of ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> (patisiran), approved for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults.”

In addition to Fast Track designation, vutrisiran has been granted Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. The safety and efficacy of vutrisiran are being evaluated in the ongoing HELIOS-A and HELIOS-B Phase 3 clinical trials. Together, these studies comprise a comprehensive clinical development program intended to demonstrate the broad impact of vutrisiran across the multisystem manifestations of disease and the full spectrum of patients with ATTR amyloidosis.

<b>About Vutrisiran
</b>Vutrisiran is an investigational, subcutaneously-administered RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, which encompasses both hereditary (hATTR) and wild-type (wtATTR) amyloidosis. It is designed to target and silence specific messenger RNA, blocking the production of wild-type and mutant transthyretin (TTR) protein before it is made. Quarterly administration of vutrisiran may help to reduce deposition and facilitate the clearance of TTR amyloid deposits in tissues and potentially restore function to these tissues. Vutrisiran utilizes Alnylam’s next-generation delivery platform known as the Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform. The safety and efficacy of vutrisiran have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency or any other health authority.

<b>About HELIOS-A Phase 3 Study
</b>HELIOS-A is a Phase 3 global, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vutrisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The trial randomized patients 3:1 to receive either 25mg of vutrisiran subcutaneously once every 12 weeks or 0.3 mg/kg of patisiran intravenously once every three weeks. For most endpoints, results from the vutrisiran arm will be compared to results from the placebo arm of the landmark APOLLO Phase 3 study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of patisiran in people with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The co-primary endpoints of HELIOS-A are the change from baseline in the modified Neurologic Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) and in the Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) score, at 9 months. Secondary endpoints include the change from baseline in key clinical evaluations including the timed 10-meter walk test (10-MWT), modified body mass index (mBMI), and Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS). The percent reduction in serum transthyretin (TTR) levels in the vutrisiran arm will be compared to the within-study patisiran arm. Additional exploratory endpoints will be assessed to determine the effect of vutrisiran on other aspects of the multisystem nature of this disease, including manifestations of cardiac amyloid involvement.

<b>About HELIOS-B Phase 3 Study
</b>HELIOS-B will evaluate the efficacy of vutrisiran versus placebo toward the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular hospitalizations at 30 months, the primary study endpoint. The study protocol includes an optional interim analysis to be conducted at the Company’s discretion. HELIOS-B complements the ongoing HELIOS-A Phase 3 study in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, creating a comprehensive clinical development program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vutrisiran across the entire disease spectrum of ATTR amyloidosis.

<b>ONPATTRO Important Safety Information
</b><span class=""bwuline"">Infusion-Related Reactions
</span>Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been observed in patients treated with ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> (patisiran). In a controlled clinical study, 19% of ONPATTRO-treated patients experienced IRRs, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. The most common symptoms of IRRs with ONPATTRO were flushing, back pain, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and headache.

To reduce the risk of IRRs, patients should receive premedication with a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and antihistamines (H1 and H2 blockers) at least 60 minutes prior to ONPATTRO infusion. Monitor patients during the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRRs. If an IRR occurs, consider slowing or interrupting the infusion and instituting medical management as clinically indicated. If the infusion is interrupted, consider resuming at a slower infusion rate only if symptoms have resolved. In the case of a serious or life-threatening IRR, the infusion should be discontinued and not resumed.

<span class=""bwuline"">Reduced Serum Vitamin A Levels and Recommended Supplementation
</span>ONPATTRO treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels. Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin A is advised for patients taking ONPATTRO. Higher doses than the RDA should not be given to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment with ONPATTRO, as serum levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body.

Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g. night blindness).

<span class=""bwuline"">Adverse Reactions
</span>The most common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with ONPATTRO were upper respiratory tract infections (29%) and infusion-related reactions (19%).

<span class=""bwuline"">Indication
</span>ONPATTRO is indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults.

<b>About Transthyretin (ATTR) Amyloidosis
</b>Transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, progressively debilitating, and fatal disease caused by misfolded TTR proteins that accumulate as amyloid deposits in multiple tissues including the nerves, heart and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There are two types of ATTR amyloidosis: hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis and wild-type (wtATTR) amyloidosis. hATTR amyloidosis is an inherited disease resulting in intractable peripheral sensory-motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy. It is estimated to affect 50,000 people worldwide. The condition can have a debilitating impact on a patient’s life and may lead to premature death within 4.7 years of diagnosis. wtATTR amyloidosis is a nonhereditary, progressive type of the disease with undefined etiology. It affects an estimated 200,000-300,000 people worldwide. It primarily manifests as cardiomyopathy, which leads to heart failure and mortality within 2 to 6 years.

<b>About RNAi
</b>RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

<b>About Alnylam
</b>Alnylam (Nasdaq: ALNY) is leading the translation of RNA interference (RNAi) into a whole new class of innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of people afflicted with rare genetic, cardio-metabolic, hepatic infectious, and central nervous system (CNS)/ocular diseases.

<h3>AstraZeneca initiates CALAVI clinical trial with Calquence against COVID-19</h3>
<h3><b><i>Trial will assess the effect of Calquence on the exaggerated immune response of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection
</i></b></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca will initiate a randomised, global clinical trial to assess the potential of <i>Calquence</i> (acalabrutinib) in the treatment of the exaggerated immune response (cytokine storm) associated with COVID-19 infection in severely ill patients.

The trial design is based upon strong scientific evidence supporting the role of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) pathway in the production of inflammatory cytokines and on encouraging early clinical data. <i>Calquence</i> is a next-generation, highly selective BTK inhibitor currently used to treat certain types of blood cancers.

The trial, called CALAVI, is based on early clinical data with <i>Calquence</i> demonstrating that a decrease in inflammation caused by BTK inhibition appears to reduce the severity of COVID-19-induced respiratory distress. The goal of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding <i>Calquence </i>to best supportive care (BSC) to reduce mortality and the need for assisted ventilation in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms.

This large, multicentre, global, randomised trial uses a two-part patient-centric design developed in record time to accelerate data capture and analysis. Part one evaluates the addition of <i>Calquence </i>to BSC versus BSC alone in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who are not in the intensive care unit (ICU). Part two evaluates the addition of <i>Calquence</i> to BSC in a cohort of patients in the ICU.

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “With this trial we are responding to the novel insights of the scientific community and hope to demonstrate that adding <i>Calquence</i> to best supportive care reduces the need to place patients on ventilators and improves their chances of survival. This is the fastest launch of any clinical trial in the history of AstraZeneca.”

Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Lymphoid Malignancies Branch at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), said: “Given the well documented role of the protein BTK in regulating inflammation, it is possible that inhibiting BTK with acalabrutinib could provide clinical benefit in patients with advanced COVID-19 lung disease. As with all new treatments, it will be necessary to gather data from clinical trials in order to understand the best and safest treatment options for patients.”

The CALAVI trial is expected to open for enrolment in the coming days in the US and several countries in Europe. Wyndham H. Wilson, MD, PhD, of NCI in the US, will serve as the principal investigator of the trial. Louis M. Staudt, MD, PhD will serve as senior investigator.

<b>CALAVI</b>

CALAVI is a large, randomised, open-label, multicentre, global, two-part trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of <i>Calquence</i>with BSC versus BSC alone in patients hospitalised with respiratory complications of COVID-19. Part one is randomised (2:1) and evaluates the addition of <i>Calquence</i> to current BSC in patients who are hospitalised but not on assisted ventilation and not in the ICU. Part two evaluates the addition of <i>Calquence</i> to BSC in a cohort of patients in the ICU with more severe respiratory complications. The trial is being conducted in multiple sites around the world. The primary endpoint measures the use of assisted ventilation or death.

<b>COVID-19</b>

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most COVID-19 cases (~80%) are mild respiratory illnesses. However, some require hospitalisation, mostly due to pneumonia, and can progress quickly to severe acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is associated with high mortality.<sup>1,2,3,4 </sup>A viral-induced cytokine storm or “hyperimmune response” is hypothesised to be a major pathogenic mechanism of ARDS in these patients through modulation of pulmonary macrophages and dendritic cells and/or neutrophils.<sup>5,6,7,8</sup>

<b><i>Calquence</i></b>

<i>Calquence</i> is a next-generation, selective inhibitor of BTK. <i>Calquence</i> binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.<sup>9,10,11,12</sup> In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.<sup>13</sup>

<i>Calquence</i> (acalabrutinib) is approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in the US and a few other countries with an active global filing programme. In addition, <i>Calquence</i> is indicated for adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy in the US and several other countries.

<b>BTK Inhibition</b>

In lung macrophages, BTK is a key regulator of the production of multiple cytokines and chemokines including TNFa, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1, among others.  BTK inhibition reduces the production of these cytokines and is, therefore, a promising strategy to reduce the respiratory complications of COVID-19.<sup>13</sup>

There is evidence that dysregulated BTK-dependent macrophage signalling may be central to the exaggerated inflammatory responses to SARS-COV-2 and play a role in COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS.<sup> 4,5,6,7</sup> In macrophages, TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8 can recognise single strand RNA from viruses such as SARS-COV-2 and initiate signalling through BTK-dependent activation of NF-kB and IRF3, triggering the production of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.<sup> 5,6,7,8</sup> In support of the role of BTK inhibition, therapeutic inhibition of BTK in patients with lymphoid malignancies results in decreased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Similar findings have been observed in mouse influenza models, where BTK inhibition also decreased these inflammatory mediators and rescued mice from lethal acute lung injury.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","TOKYO and LONDON, April 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Sosei Group Corporation (“the Company”) (TSE: 4565) today announces it will apply its unique structure-based drug design platform and capabilities to the global research efforts to discover drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and to treat COVID-19.

The Company has initiated a new R&D program to identify novel compounds that block the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 MPro protease (Nsp5), which has been designated as an important potential target for drug development.1,2 The Mproprotease cleaves a polyprotein encoded by the viral genome into 12 non-structural proteins (Nsp4-Nsp16) some of which play crucial roles in viral replication.1-3

The Company has created a multidisciplinary team spanning structural and biophysical analysis, computational chemistry and medicinal chemistry. The team brings a wealth of experience in SBDD and cutting-edge technologies that will be applied to the precision design of new inhibitor compounds against not only the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus but also predicted future variants.

All findings from the program will be made freely available to the global research community investigating solutions to the COVID-19 crisis.

Sosei Heptares is looking to establish collaborations with industry partners to support this program and also to contribute its unique expertise to other areas under investigation as part of the global effort by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to find new treatments for COVID-19.

Malcolm Weir, Executive Vice Chairman of Sosei Heptares, commented: “The COVID-19 pandemic has brought together the biomedical R&D community like never before. It has created a strong industry-wide effort to direct innovative and powerful technologies to develop diagnostics and therapies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, with the intention of controlling the current COVID-19 situation as well as potentially to prevent future epidemics and pandemics. We are confident that Sosei Heptares can play an important part in these efforts and that our unique SBDD capabilities can make a difference as part of our new program and more broadly in collaboration with industry partners.”

The Company has created a covid19@soseiheptares.com contact address for companies and researchers who would like to discuss possible collaborations.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the U.S. launch of ONTRUZANT (trastuzumab-dttb), as a biosimilar of the reference biologic medicine Herceptin. ONTRUZANT is available in both 150 mg single-dose vials and 420 mg multiple-dose vials.

ONTRUZANT will be introduced in the U.S. at a list price (wholesaler acquisition cost) of approximately $1,325 for the 150 mg single-dose vial and $3,709 for the 420 mg multiple-dose vial (prices are rounded), representing a 15% discount to the current list price of Herceptin. Wholesaler acquisition costs do not include discounts to payers, providers, distributors and other purchasing organizations.

ONTRUZANT is indicated for adjuvant treatment of HER2 overexpressing node positive or node negative (ER/PR negative or with one high risk feature) breast cancer as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel; as part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin; as a single agent following multi-modality anthracycline based therapy. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product. Serious and sometimes fatal side effects have been reported with trastuzumab products. Subclinical and clinical cardiac failure have been reported. The incidence and severity were highest in patients receiving trastuzumab with anthracycline-containing regimens. Discontinue ONTRUZANT treatment for cardiomyopathy. Administration of ONTRUZANT can result in serious and fatal infusion reactions and pulmonary toxicity. Discontinue ONTRUZANT for anaphylaxis, angioedema, interstitial pneumonitis or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Exposure to ONTRUZANT during pregnancy can result in oligohydramnios, in some cases complicated by pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death. Exacerbation of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia can also occur. Detection of HER2 protein overexpression is necessary for selection of patients appropriate for ONTRUZANT therapy.

ONTRUZANT is being launched in the U.S. by Merck as part of a development and commercialization agreement with Samsung Bioepis. Under terms of the agreement, Samsung Bioepis is responsible for preclinical and clinical development, process development and manufacturing, clinical trials and regulatory registration. Merck will be responsible for all commercialization activities for products approved in its partnered territories, including the U.S.

ONTRUZANT was approved by the FDA in January 2019 based on the review of Samsung Bioepis’ comprehensive data package, which included extensive structural and functional analytical data, nonclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic data, and a comparative clinical study demonstrating that ONTRUZANT is highly similar to its reference product, Herceptin, in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product.

On Feb. 5, 2020, Merck announced that it intends to spin-off products from its Women’s Health, trusted Legacy Brands and Biosimilars businesses, including ONTRUZANT, into a new, independent, publicly-traded company. Merck will continue to fully support the commercialization of ONTRUZANT until the spinoff, which is intended to take place in the first half of 2021, at which time ONTRUZANT will become a product of the new company.

ONTRUZANT Indications and Usage

Adjuvant Breast Cancer

ONTRUZANT is indicated for adjuvant treatment of HER2-overexpressing node-positive or node negative (ER/PR-negative or with one high-risk feature) breast cancer:

As part of a treatment regimen containing doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel
As part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin
As a single agent following multimodality anthracycline-based therapy
Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product.

Metastatic Breast Cancer

ONTRUZANT is indicated:

In combination with paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer
As a single agent for treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in patients who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease
Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product.

Metastatic Gastric Cancer

ONTRUZANT is indicated, in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil, for the treatment of patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease.

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product.

Selected Safety Information

Cardiomyopathy

Administration of trastuzumab products can result in subclinical and clinical cardiac failure. The incidence and severity was highest in patients receiving a trastuzumab product with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens. In a pivotal adjuvant breast cancer trial, one patient who developed congestive heart failure (CHF) died of cardiomyopathy.
Evaluate left ventricular function in all patients prior to and during treatment with ONTRUZANT. Discontinue ONTRUZANT treatment in patients receiving adjuvant therapy and withhold ONTRUZANT in patients with metastatic disease for clinically significant decrease in left ventricular function.
Infusion Reactions; Pulmonary Toxicity

Administration of trastuzumab products can result in serious and fatal infusion reactions and pulmonary toxicity. Symptoms usually occur during or within 24 hours of administration. Interrupt ONTRUZANT infusion for dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension. Monitor patients until symptoms completely resolve. Discontinue ONTRUZANT for anaphylaxis, angioedema, interstitial pneumonitis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Exposure to trastuzumab products during pregnancy can result in oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.
Warnings and Precautions

Cardiomyopathy

Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death. Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

There is a 4 to 6-fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab products as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab products. The highest absolute incidence occurs when a trastuzumab product is administered with an anthracycline.

Withhold ONTRUZANT for = 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and = 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. The safety of continuation or resumption of ONTRUZANT in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied.

Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping ONTRUZANT may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction.

Cardiac Monitoring:Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended:

Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of ONTRUZANT
LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of ONTRUZANT
Repeat LVEF measurement at 4-week intervals if ONTRUZANT is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction.
LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of ONTRUZANT as a component of adjuvant therapy.
Infusion Reactions

Infusion reactions consist of a symptom complex characterized by fever and chills, and on occasion included nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, rash, and asthenia.

In post-marketing reports, serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction.

Interrupt ONTRUZANT infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions.

There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications.

Embryo-fetal Toxicity

Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death.

Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ONTRUZANT. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to ONTRUZANT during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of ONTRUZANT.

Pulmonary Toxicity

Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity.

Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia

In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not.

Drug Interactions

Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab products may be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction because of trastuzumab’s long washout period based on population PK Analysis. If possible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab products. If anthracyclines are used, the patient’s cardiac function should be monitored carefully.

Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving trastuzumab products in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of trastuzumab product treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity.

In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (= 10%) that were increased (= 5% difference) in the patients receiving trastuzumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of trastuzumab treatment in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia.

Use in Specific Populations

Lactation

There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab products in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother’s clinical need for ONTRUZANT treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ONTRUZANT or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab product wash out period of 7 months.

Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of trastuzumab products in pediatric patients have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Trastuzumab has been studied in patients who were 65 years of age or over in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer treatment settings. The risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients in both those receiving treatment for metastatic disease, or adjuvant therapy.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced it granted Emergency Use Authorization to Ortho Clinical Diagnostics’ total antibody assay for COVID-19—the VITROS® Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Reagent Pack and Calibrators. This test is one of the first high-throughput, automated* COVID-19 antibody tests to be granted Emergency Use Authorization.

Across the globe, health care professionals, researchers, and government officials are racing to find solutions to better manage COVID-19 and prevent it from impacting additional lives. Ortho’s COVID-19 total antibody test can help determine who can responsibly be permitted to go back to work by  aiding in the identification of currently infected or previously exposed individuals who may have developed immunity.

The test can also help screen plasma donations for convalescent plasma therapy, which helps critically ill patients fight the virus, help medical professionals and epidemiologists better understand the spread of the disease, and is an important tool for aiding vaccine development efforts to monitor immune responsiveness. When coupled with information from a molecular test, which detects active infection, it can monitor disease progression by measuring when antibodies appear in the blood.

The tests can be run on Ortho’s flagship laboratory analyzer, the VITROS® XT 7600 Integrated System, the VITROS® 3600 Immunodiagnostic System, the VITROS® 5600 Integrated System and will soon be available on VITROS® ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic Systems.<sup>i</sup> VITROS Systems, already installed in more than 1,000 hospitals and reference labs in the U.S., are self-contained and do not require an external water source to run, offering labs placement flexibility.

A limited quantity of tests kits have already been shipped to areas of highest priority. Ortho will be in full production in the coming weeks and plans to manufacture several million SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests over the next month, with rapid production expansion following thereafter.

Following Ortho’s April 3 launch of the test under the FDA’s notification pathway for serology tests, Ortho further worked with the FDA to secure additional review of the data under its Emergency Use Authorization pathway, which allows the FDA to expedite review and authorization of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests to rapidly expand testing capacity during the COVID-19 public health emergency.

The VITROS® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are designed and solely intended to be performed by laboratory professionals and cannot be directly used by patients as they are not for home use.

Questions from laboratories, healthcare providers, government, or media regarding the COVID-19 antibody test can be directed to: <a href=""http://OrthoCOVID19Test@orthoclinicaldiagnostics.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">OrthoCOVID19Test@orthoclinicaldiagnostics.com</a>.

*High Throughput: If an instrument has high throughput, it can output a large number of test results in a short period of time. When running infectious disease tests such as our COVID-19 tests, Ortho’s instruments can process up to 150 tests per hour.

If an instrument is fully automated, it doesn’t require a lab employee to perform each test by hand. Instead, each patient tube is loaded in bulk into the instrument, and the instrument automatically mixes the patient sample with test solutions. The ensuing chemical reaction provides the patient result. That result is automatically sent to the hospital’s laboratory information systems and ultimately, the physician.

""We continue to contribute in a significant and meaningful way by providing new solutions across our diagnostics testing platforms,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Robert B. Ford</span>, president and chief executive officer, Abbott. ""I'm extremely proud of the many Abbott people who are working around the clock to get as many tests as we can to healthcare workers and patients.""

<b>Antibody tests to expand testing and help healthcare workers<br class=""dnr"" /></b>While molecular testing detects whether someone has the virus, antibody tests determine if someone was previously infected.

Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG test identifies the IgG antibody, which is a protein that the body produces in the late stages of infection and may remain for up to months and possibly years after a person has recovered. Abbott's IgG antibody test will initially be available on its ARCHITECT<sup>®</sup> <i>i</i>1000SR and <i>i</i>2000SR laboratory instruments<sup>*</sup>. More than 2,000 of these instruments are in use in U.S. laboratories. These instruments can run up to 100-200 tests per hour.

Abbott is making the test available as part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notification without an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway outlined in Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 during the Public Health Emergency. Additionally, Abbott plans to file an EUA submission with the FDA and plans to CE Mark to the IVD Directive (98/79/EC) in the European Union.

Abbott is significantly scaling up its manufacturing for antibody testing and is expecting to immediately ship close to 1 million tests this week to U.S. customers, and will ship a total of 4 million tests in total for April. The company is ramping up to 20 million tests in the U.S. in June and beyond as it expands the tests to run on its new Alinity<sup>™</sup> i system. Abbott also will be expanding its laboratory antibody testing to the detection of the antibody, IgM, in the near future.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Scaled using Microsoft Azure, GE Healthcare’s Mural Virtual Care Solution allows clinicians to view numerous ventilated patients simultaneously and remotely; enables early identification of patients at risk of deterioration

CHICAGO – April 15, 2020 – GE Healthcare today introduced a new software solution to support clinicians and health systems in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The company is bringing its Mural Virtual Care Solution, which is designed to give hospitals a broad view across their ventilated patient population and help identify patients at risk of deterioration, to the highly secure and trusted Microsoft Azure cloud platform. This is the latest step in the ongoing collaboration between GE Healthcare and Microsoft.

As more patients enter health systems for COVID-19 treatment, hospitals face increased demands on clinical resources. The Mural Virtual Care Solution 1,2 helps ease this pressure by enabling clinical surveillance of intensive care unit (ICU) patients – including those on mechanical ventilation – in a central place, giving a comprehensive view of each patient’s data across the hospital network.

“As both large and small hospitals treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients, the strain on healthcare providers and systems will be unprecedented,” said GE Healthcare President and CEO Kieran Murphy. “Not only is GE Healthcare providing critically important medical devices to address this global challenge, but we are also rapidly scaling technologies to aid clinicians in delivering safe, effective and efficient care. We are excited to have a partner like Microsoft to help us arm clinicians with the software tools they need.”

A Mural installation across a 100-bed multi-site ICU network is monitored by three senior nurses and two intensivists around the clock. With a potential shortage of intensivists and bedside caregivers, Mural supports these teams by enabling additional oversight of patients across the hospital network. Bringing together near real-time data3 from ventilators, patient monitoring systems, electronic medical records, labs and other systems, Mural allows one clinician to monitor several patients at once, supplementing existing monitoring devices in patients’ rooms. Remote surveillance may also reduce clinicians’ exposure to COVID-19, while maintaining a broad view of patients across the hospital.

“Now more than ever we need to manage a greater number of ventilated patients with limited resources. Mural Virtual Care on Microsoft Azure allows for remote management and surveillance of ventilated patients at scale,” said Microsoft Global Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Rhew.

In addition to real-time remote management, Mural also enables health systems to activate care protocols relevant to treating COVID-19 patients and help caregivers ensure those protocols are being followed. Customized with hospitals to provide data and calculations based on their care protocols, Mural can also help identify patients needing intervention. This includes ventilation and lung injury management for patients on extended mechanical ventilation support. The technology can be used by hospitals or health systems of any size, and Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), for example, has deployed the solution.

“Facing the daunting outlook of a COVID-19 surge, it is imperative that I and my fellow healthcare workers use virtual ICU technology to safely monitor and care for our sickest patients while preserving PPE,” said Matthias Merkel, M.D., Ph.D., OHSU’s Chief Medical Capacity Officer, Vice Chair of Critical Care Medicine, and Professor of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine. “Remaining closely connected and supported through technology enables us to progress our patients’ care across a geographic distance that we would otherwise be unable to manage.”

By powering Mural with Azure, GE Healthcare will give health systems access to an affordable and highly secure solution that can be deployed and scaled quickly. Through January 31, 2021, GE Healthcare is waiving Mural software subscription charges. More information can be found at: www.gehealthcare.com/mural.

 

1 Enabled by DECISIOInsight® – a standalone medical device.

2 The Mural Virtual Care Solution COVID-19 offering does not provide all options available in the Mural Virtual Care Solution. Refer to the website for additional details.

3 Near real-time data requires HL7 data feed from connected devices.

Novavax's early development efforts on vaccines for two other recent coronavirus epidemics – severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and <span class=""xn-location"">Middle East</span> respiratory syndrome (MERS), along with prior work on Ebola (phase 1 trial conducted in <span class=""xn-location"">Australia</span>) – allows them to leverage their understanding of coronaviruses and adapt their research to create a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

""The urgent global race to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic drove our rapid identification and selection of an optimal, highly immunogenic vaccine candidate,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Stanley C. Erck</span>, President and CEO of Novavax. ""We are pleased that Nucleus, our long-time partner, was able to accommodate our accelerated timeline.""

The Phase 1 trial of NVX-CoV2373 is expected to begin in mid-May with preliminary immunogenicity and safety results in July.

The scale and absolute commitment to the highest standards make Nucleus the ideal partner in the rapid development of the vaccine for COVID-19.

""We own 150 of the total 250 dedicated phase I beds available in <span class=""xn-location"">Australia</span> over two sites in <span class=""xn-location"">Melbourne</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Brisbane</span>, located within major medical precincts. Supported by our workforce of over 400 specialists, we are in the unique position of offering sponsors a multi-site pathway to conduct their clinical trials,"" says Johnson.

This scale allows Nucleus to address the urgency of the COVID-19 vaccine studies, without interruption to other ongoing clinical trials. The standards ensure the reliability of the studies, especially in the current pandemic situation across the world.

""For all of our clinical trials, Nucleus has implemented the highest level of Transmission-Based Precautions within its clinical units including the creation of dedicated teams of clinical staff,"" says Nucleus Infectious Diseases Physician and Microbiologist and, Associate Professor of Medicine at the <span class=""xn-org"">University of Queensland</span>, Dr <span class=""xn-person"">Paul Griffin</span>. ""These staff are assigned to work only in functional designated areas and there is no cross-pollination of these teams, improving safety, reducing study risk, and ensuring integrity of the trials.""

As a key partner in the development of these promising vaccine candidates, Nucleus' role in solving the current pandemic is top of mind for Johnson.

""As COVID-19 continues to impact the everyday life of all global citizens, finding a solution has become an urgent objective for governments and health organisations around the world. The world is watching and we're on the front line, supporting Novavax to unlock the potential of a Coronavirus COVID-19 vaccine.""

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., April 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><i>REGN-EB3 developed via same rapid response platform currently being leveraged to develop novel COVID-19 antibody therapy</i></li>
</ul>
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review a new Biologics License Application (BLA) for REGN-EB3, an investigational triple antibody cocktail treatment for Ebola virus infection. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 25, 2020.

The REGN-EB3 BLA is supported by data from the randomized, controlled PALM clinical trial conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In August 2019, the trial was stopped early when preliminary results showed that REGN-EB3 crossed the pre-specified superiority threshold for preventing death compared to the control arm, ZMapp. REGN-EB3 <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2778543-1&amp;h=2078433846&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fnew-england-journal-medicine-publishes-results-ebola-clinical&amp;a=demonstrated+superior+efficacy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">demonstrated superior efficacy</a> compared to ZMapp across multiple measures, including reduced mortality and fewer days until the Ebola virus was no longer detected in the bloodstream.

""Developed using Regeneron's proprietary <i>VelociSuite</i><sup>®</sup> rapid response technologies, REGN-EB3 was shown to save lives in the PALM trial, which evaluated multiple therapies against the current standard of care,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. ""Regeneron is now applying this same approach to develop an antibody medicine that can potentially prevent and treat COVID-19, with initial clinical trials expected to begin in June.""

Regeneron's <i>VelociSuite</i><sup> </sup>technologies enable the efficient creation and selection of potent fully-human antibodies against a specific biological target, which is particularly critical for addressing new and/or quickly-spreading pathogens such as Ebola and COVID-19. These technologies facilitate the rapid cloning and generation of optimized fully-human antibodies from both <i>VelocImmune</i><sup>®</sup> mice (which are genetically-engineered to have genetically-humanized immune systems) and convalescing human volunteers, and allow for the rapid escalation of fully-human antibodies into manufacturing-quality cell line production and large-scale bioreactor manufacturing. Once strong therapeutic antibody candidates are identified, the company's in-house preclinical, clinical and commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities allow for fast scale-up and flexibility to adapt to current need.

REGN-EB3 has received Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA. It is being developed under an ongoing collaboration and with funding provided <span id=""spanHghlt1448"">by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response </span>within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USG Contract Nos. HHSO100201700016C and HHSO100201500013C).

<b>About Regeneron
</b>Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases. Founded and led for over 30 years by physician-scientists, our unique ability to repeatedly and consistently translate science into medicine has led to seven FDA-approved treatments and numerous product candidates in development, all of which were homegrown in our laboratories. Our medicines and pipeline are designed to help patients with eye diseases, allergic and inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, pain, infectious diseases and rare diseases.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Companies to negotiate a collaboration on the development of a breakthrough COVID-19 self-test solution based on Luminostics’ proprietary technology.
Sanofi to leverage its global distribution network to ensure global availability, subject to relevant regulatory approvals.
 

PARIS – April 16, 2020 – Sanofi and Luminostics have signed an agreement to evaluate a collaboration on a unique self-testing solution for COVID-19, using Luminostics’ innovative technology, and further adding to Sanofi’s ongoing efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic on multiple fronts.

Luminostics would contribute its proprietary technology for consumer-diagnostics for COVID-19 testing while Sanofi would bring its clinical research testing experience and capabilities. The goal is to provide a smartphone-based solution that eliminates the current need for healthcare professional administration or laboratory tests.

“This partnering project could lead to another important milestone in Sanofi’s fight against COVID-19. The development of a self-testing solution with Luminostics could help provide clarity to an individual – in minutes – on whether or not they are infected” says Alan Main, Executive Vice President, Head of Sanofi Consumer Healthcare. “Following this week’s announcement of an unprecedented partnership with GSK in the hunt for a vaccine, our company’s ambition is to continue to find other ways to help solve this pandemic situation.”  

The goal of this collaboration is to provide a consumer-based test that can detect the COVID-19 virus with high sensitivity and specificity from respiratory samples. The total time from specimen collection to results is expected in the range of 30 minutes or less. It is based on Luminostics’ unique technology that utilizes a consumer smartphone’s optics, controlled by an iOS/Android app paired with an inexpensive adapter, in combination with “glow-in-the-dark” nanochemistry and signal processing artificial intelligence.

The diagnostic platform is composed of:

an iOS/Android app to instruct a user on how to run the test, capture and process data to display test results, and then to connect users with a telehealth service based on the results;
a reusable adapter compatible with most types of smartphones; and
consumables for specimen collection, preparation, and processing.
During the current COVID-19 crisis it became obvious that rapid, reliable mass testing is one of the key strategies for successful containment of a pandemic outbreak. While point-of-care tests were made available relatively quickly – although not in a sufficient quantity – no over-the-counter (OTC) self-testing solution is currently available. A rapid self-testing solution would come with multiple advantages, including:

easy access and availability to patients at thousands of points-of-sale including e-commerce;
no further interpersonal contact necessary to conduct the testing, thereby lowering the infection risk for patient, HCP, and laboratory staff; and
immediate availability of results allowing fast decision making, providing consumers both public health and out-of-pocket cost benefits.
As one of the leading companies in the fight against COVID-19, Sanofi is already engaged in multiple clinical trials evaluating current treatment options (Kevzara® and Plaquenil®) in patients suffering from COVID-19 as well as two vaccine programs.

Based on Luminostics’ existing technology and protypes, both companies envisage to start development activities in the coming weeks. In parallel, both parties expect to execute a final collaboration agreement including a plan for accelerated ramp up of necessary manufacturing capabilities. If development activities can be successfully conducted, the aim is to have an OTC self-testing solution ready before the end of 2020, subject to obtaining required regulatory clearances.

</strong></li>
</ul>
Basel, 17 April 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the development and upcoming launch of its Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology test to detect antibodies in people who have been exposed to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the COVID-19 disease.

Antibody testing is central to help identify people who have been infected by the virus, especially those who may have been infected but did not display symptoms.³ Additionally, the test can support priority screening of high risk groups, such as healthcare workers, food supply workers who might already have developed a certain level of immunity and can continue serving and/or return to work. Once we understand more about the immunity of COVID-19, it could also help society return faster to normality.

Severin Schwan, CEO Roche Group: “Following the launch of our high-volume PCR test in mid-March to detect active infection of the disease, we are now going to launch a new antibody test in early May. Every reliable test on the market serves its purpose for healthcare systems to help us overcome this pandemic. Roche is collaborating closely with health authorities and ramping up production to ensure fast availability of the test globally.”

“Roche is deeply committed to supporting the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. ""Timely availability and fast access to reliable, high quality tests are essential for healthcare systems. The antibody test is an important next step in the fight against COVID-19. Roche’s antibody test can be quickly scaled and made broadly available around the world as our instrument infrastructure is already in place.”

The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay is an in vitro test, using human serum and plasma drawn from a blood sample, to detect antibodies and determine the body’s immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2. The test may be used in epidemiological research to help better understand the spread of the disease and may also be used together with molecular tests to aid in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients. Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers, which are widely available in laboratories around the world.

Roche aims to have the antibody test available by early May in countries accepting the CE mark and is actively working with the FDA for an Emergency Use Authorisation. Roche is planning on an accelerated ramp up of monthly production to high double-digit million tests by June and will further scale up production as fast as possible.

<strong>About SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus)</strong>
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain which has not previously been identified in humans.

Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and fever. In more severe cases, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death can occur.

To control the spread of the infection, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness.

<strong>About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology test
</strong>Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the in vitro detection of antibodies (including IgG) to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human serum and plasma. Through a blood sample, the test can detect antibodies to the coronavirus, which could signal whether a person has been already infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers which are widely available around the world. These fully-automated systems can provide SARS-CoV-2 test results in approximately 18 minutes, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyser.4

Under the terms of the agreement, BARDA will fund the advancement of mRNA-1273 to FDA licensure. A Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 is being conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Phase 1 open-label study, which began on March 16, 2020 has completed enrollment of the original study: 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years in three dose cohorts (25 µg, 100 µg and 250 µg). The NIH recently amended the Phase 1 protocol to include an additional six cohorts: three cohorts of older adults (ages 51-70) and three cohorts of elderly adults (age 71 and above). Enrollment for these cohorts is ongoing.

If supported by safety data from the Phase 1 study, the Company intends to begin a Phase 2 study of mRNA-1273 under its own Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second quarter of 2020. Subject to data from these studies and discussions with regulators, a Phase 3 study could begin as soon as fall, 2020. BARDA funding will support these late-stage clinical development programs, as well as the scale-up of mRNA-1273 manufacture in 2020 to enable potential pandemic response.

To support the scale-up, Moderna plans to hire up to 150 new team members in the U.S. this year. This includes a significant increase in its skilled manufacturing staff to expand manufacturing capacity from two shifts per day, 5 days per week to three shifts per day, 7 days per week, engineers to manage process scale-up, and clinical and regulatory staff to support clinical development.

“We are thankful for BARDA’s support to fund the accelerated development of mRNA-1273, our vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2,” said Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer. “Time is of the essence to provide a vaccine against this pandemic virus. By investing now in our manufacturing process scale-up to enable large scale production for pandemic response, we believe that we would be able to supply millions of doses per month in 2020 and with further investments, tens of millions per month in 2021, if the vaccine candidate is successful in the clinic.”

“Vaccines are a critical tool for saving lives and stopping the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” said BARDA Director Rick Bright, Ph.D. “Delivering a safe and effective vaccine for a rapidly spreading virus requires accelerated action. BARDA’s goal is to have vaccine available as quickly as possible and preparing now for advanced stage clinical trials and production scale-up while the Phase 1 is underway could shave months off development of COVID-19 vaccines.”

<b>About mRNA-1273</b>

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was selected by Moderna in collaboration with investigators from Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIH-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing.

<b>About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality</b>

Moderna scientists designed the Company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. More than 1,400 participants have been enrolled in Moderna’s infectious disease vaccine clinical studies under health authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across six Phase 1 studies, the Company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.modernatx.com%2Fprogram-detail&amp;esheet=52205192&amp;newsitemid=20200416005985&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=nine+development+candidates&amp;index=4&amp;md5=f92a5d96fd50f753f4d68f59dbb7c4e7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">nine development candidates</a> in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

<i>Vaccines against respiratory infections</i>

 	<li>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults (mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1172 or V172 with Merck)</li>
 	<li>RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)</li>
 	<li>Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)</li>
 	<li>Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (mRNA-1273)</li>
 	<li>Influenza H7N9 (mRNA-1851)</li>
</ul>
<i>Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby</i>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647)</li>
 	<li>Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA)</li>
</ul>
<i>Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections</i>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189)</li>
</ul>
To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for seven prophylactic vaccines (H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3, CMV and Zika). Moderna’s CMV vaccine is currently in a Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna’s investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.

<p align=""justify""><strong>About Surufatinib</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Surufatinib is a novel, oral angio-immuno kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity associated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (“VEGFR”) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), which both inhibit angiogenesis, and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which regulates tumor-associated macrophages, promoting the body’s immune response against tumor cells.  Its unique dual mechanism of action may be very suitable for possible combinations with other immunotherapies.</p>

<p align=""justify""><strong>About Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET)</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Neuroendocrine tumors form in cells that interact with the nervous system or in glands that produce hormones.  They can originate in various parts of the body, most often in the gut or the lungs and can be benign or malignant.  Neuroendocrine tumors are typically classified as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.  Approved targeted therapies include Sutent<sup>®</sup> and Afinitor<sup>®</sup> for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, or well-differentiated, non-functional gastrointestinal or lung neuroendocrine tumors.</p>
<p align=""justify"">According to Frost and Sullivan, there were 19,000 newly diagnosed cases of neuroendocrine tumors in the U.S. in 2018.  Importantly, neuroendocrine tumors are associated with a relatively long duration of survival compared to other tumors.  As a result, there were approximately 141,000 estimated patients living with neuroendocrine tumors in the U.S. in 2018 of which over 90%, or approximately 132,000, were non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patients.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In China, there were approximately 67,600 newly diagnosed neuroendocrine tumor patients in 2018 and, considering the current incidence to prevalence ratio in China, potentially as many as 300,000 patients living with the disease in the country<sup>2</sup>.  It is estimated that approximately 80% of the patients living with neuroendocrine tumors in China are non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patients.</p>

1Health.io’s test kits and cloud platform were designed to support the following goals:
<ol class=""bwlistdecimal"">
 	<li>Allow a patient to have saliva collected in a special saliva kit during a telehealth session with a care provider supervising from a remote location.</li>
 	<li>Support doctors who are attending to their patients online through TeleHealth platforms, allowing them to supervise a COVID-19 test over TeleHealth platforms.</li>
 	<li>Reduce the need for a healthcare provider to personally perform the sample collection. The test kit is a simple saliva spit kit that can be supervised remotely, reducing risk of unintended infections of the healthcare provider.</li>
 	<li>Reduce the need for consumption of nasal swabs which are in shortage across the US hospital systems.</li>
 	<li>The kits are 100% US made, eliminating substantial supply chain complexity and import dependency.</li>
 	<li>Facilitate doctors and rural clinics with limited access to local lab equipment to obtain high quality COVID-19 testing for their patients while reducing the incidence of secondary infection.</li>
 	<li>Digitally deliver test results to the ordering healthcare provider, upon approval to the patient, within 3-4 days of specimen collection.</li>
</ol>
“As a country we are going through challenging times and all of us are trying to help in some capacity,” said Mehdi Maghsoodnia, CEO of 1Health.io. “Our focus as a team is to help bring fast and reliable testing to everyone universally. We are hoping that by providing an end-to-end platform that performs testing, contact tracing, telehealth and clinical supervision, we can enable our healthcare providers to rapidly obtain tests for their patients regardless of their location.”

1Health.io will initially release the supply of test kits to hospital systems and doctors who want to remotely collect specimens from COVID-19 symptomatic patients within clinical settings.

1Health.io is committed to both reducing testing cost and providing universal testing to as many Americans as possible. The company has received inbound demand from multiple state and hospital systems for its test kit capacity and has committed to maintain price transparency in the process. The price of the test kit will not change for consumers, individual doctors, government agencies or large hospital systems.

The test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and can be found at the following page on the FDA site: <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedia%2F136875%2Fdownload&amp;esheet=52202948&amp;newsitemid=20200415005543&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedia%2F136875%2Fdownload&amp;index=2&amp;md5=3107ed86b06fdfb75521131685989dab"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">https://www.fda.gov/media/136875/download</a>

</ul>
<strong>Basel, </strong><strong>April 20, 2020</strong> — Novartis has reached an agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to proceed with a Phase III clinical trial with approximately 440 patients to evaluate the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease. The clinical trial drug supply will be provided by Sandoz, the generics and biosimilars division of Novartis.

The large trial sponsored by Novartis will be conducted at more than a dozen sites in the United States. Novartis plans to begin enrollment for this study within the next few weeks and is committed to reporting results as soon as possible. To help achieve broad access to hydroxychloroquine as quickly as possible in these extraordinary circumstances, Novartis will make any intellectual property within our control that relates to the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent COVID-19 available through non-exclusive voluntary licenses, appropriate waivers, or similar mechanisms.

“We recognize the importance of answering the scientific question of whether hydroxychloroquine will be beneficial for patients with COVID-19 disease,” said John Tsai, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer at Novartis. “We mobilized quickly to address this question in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.”

As the new virus continues to spread and claim lives around the globe, doctors and patients are eager for treatment options. In some cases, clinicians are evaluating drugs that have been approved for other diseases, hoping that these will also work against COVID-19.

Patients in the trial will be randomized into three groups. The first group or arm will receive hydroxychloroquine. The second group will receive hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, which is an antibiotic therapy. The third group will receive placebo. Patients in all treatment groups are receiving standard of care for COVID-19. Researchers at the company compressed months of work into a few weeks to design the large clinical trial in order to rapidly respond to the need for COVID-19 disease treatments.

The clinical trial complements a commitment by Novartis, through Sandoz, to donate up to 130 million tablets of hydroxychloroquine to supply global clinical research efforts in the event the medicine is proven beneficial for treatment of COVID-19. Sandoz has already donated 30 million tablets to the US Department of Health and Human Services and is dispatching futher shipments to countries based on requests from governments around the world.

“We are donating hydroxychloroquine tablets for COVID-19 patients including for use in this and other clinical trials with the hope that researchers and healthcare workers can quickly and scientifically determine whether hydroxychloroquine can help patients around the world combat this disease,” said Richard Saynor, CEO of Sandoz. “We will continue to fulfill orders for existing customers to ensure the medicine remains available to US patients who rely on it for other indicated uses.”

As part of its research and development commitment, Novartis has formed a clinical investigation team to provide rapid access for approved clinical requests and support of clinical evaluation of its medicines to be repurposed and address the needs of patients with COVID-19 infections. In addition to hydroxychloroquine, Novartis plans to sponsor or co-sponsor clinical trials to study ruxolitinib and canakinumab for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections. Requests for investigator-initiated trials have been granted for COVID-19-related clinical studies of ruxolitinib, canakinumab, imatinib mesylate, secukinumab, hydroxychloroquine and valsartan.

<strong>About hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 </strong>
The drug hydroxychloroquine has garnered interest in the medical community after showing preliminary promise in small clinical studies, including one with co-administration with the antibiotic azithromycin.<sup>1 </sup>In addition, hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory tests.<sup>2,3</sup> Hydroxychloroquine has long been used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases.<sup>4</sup>

<strong>Novartis commitment and response to COVID-19</strong>
Novartis is deeply dedicated to the global effort to combat COVID-19 and doing our part to support the stability of global healthcare systems. We announced a broad set of measures including the creation of a global fund of USD 20 million to support communities around the world impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Novartis also has committed 130 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to support pandemic response. In addition, Novartis joined two key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard, as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership organized by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). Novartis is separately supporting COVID-19 related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. To support access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19.

 	<li><strong>Reduces infusion time to 2 hours from the current 3.5 hours for patients with relapsing or primary progressive multiple sclerosis, if approved</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Applications are based on data from the randomised, double-blind ENSEMBLE PLUS study, showing consistent safety to the currently approved OCREVUS dosing regimen</strong></li>

<strong> </strong>
Basel, 20 April 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated the application for a two-hour OCREVUS® (ocrelizumab) infusion time, dosed twice yearly for relapsing or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS).

“With more than 150,000 people treated with OCREVUS, the twice-yearly dosing schedule has benefited many MS patients and their physicians, as indicated by more than 90 percent* of patients continuing with treatment through one year,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We hope a shorter infusion time will further improve the experience for people living with MS while also increasing capacity in healthcare systems.”

The regulatory applications are based on data from the randomised, double-blind ENSEMBLE PLUS study, which showed comparable frequency and severity of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) for a two-hour OCREVUS infusion time vs. the currently approved 3.5-hour time in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). The first dose was administered per the approved dosing schedule (two 300 mg intravenous (IV) infusions separated by two weeks) and the second or later doses (600 mg IV infusion) were administered over a shorter, two-hour time. The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients with IRRs following the first randomised 600 mg infusion (frequency/severity assessed during and 24-hours post infusion). No patients discontinued the study due to an IRR and no new safety signals were detected.

Detailed data will be presented at the earliest opportunity. The FDA and the European Commission are expected to make decisions on these applications by the end of 2020.

With rapidly growing real-world experience and more than 150,000 patients treated globally, OCREVUS has twice-yearly (six-monthly) dosing and is the first and only therapy approved for RMS (including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and active, or relapsing, secondary progressive MS, in addition to clinically isolated syndrome in the U.S.) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). OCREVUS is approved in 90 countries across North America, South America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, as well as in Australia, Switzerland and the European Union.

<strong>About OCREVUS</strong><strong>®</strong><strong> (ocrelizumab)
</strong>OCREVUS is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including RRMS and active, or relapsing, SPMS, in addition to CIS in the U.S.) and PPMS. OCREVUS is a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target CD20-positive B cells, a specific type of immune cell thought to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage. This nerve cell damage can lead to disability in people with MS. Based on preclinical studies, OCREVUS binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, suggesting that important functions of the immune system may be preserved. OCREVUS is administered by intravenous infusion every six months. The initial dose is given as two 300 mg infusions given two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as single 600 mg infusions.

<p class=""bwalignc""><i>- Expanded Access Program allowing additional eligible patients with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm to receive ruxolitinib is also open for enrollment in the United States</i></p>
WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 17, 2020-- Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced the initiation of RUXCOVID, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib (Jakafi<sup>®</sup>) plus standard-of-care (SoC) in patients aged =12 years with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm. The collaborative study is sponsored by Incyte in the United States and Novartis outside of the United States.

The composite primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who die, develop respiratory failure (require mechanical ventilation) or require intensive care unit (ICU) care by Day 29. Secondary endpoints comprise various efficacy assessments including evaluation of clinical status using a 9-point ordinal scale; in-hospital outcomes (mortality rate; proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation; duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation); change in the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2); change in SpO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio; proportion of patients with no oxygen therapy (oxygen saturation of =94% on room air); and safety. RUXCOVID will enroll approximately 400 patients globally.

Additionally, given the urgent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, Incyte is also initiating a separate emergency Expanded Access Program (EAP) in the United States. The protocol will allow eligible patients with severe COVID-19 associated cytokine storm to receive ruxolitinib while it is being investigated for this indication.

“There is an unprecedented unmet medical need for treatments that prevent or reduce severe COVID-19 related complications to improve outcomes for patients and alleviate the overwhelming pressure on the global healthcare system,” said Steven Stein, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Incyte. “We thank the FDA for the expedited review of the RUXCOVID study and hope to enroll this important clinical trial as quickly as possible to determine the potential utility of ruxolitinib for treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 associated cytokine storm.”

RUXCOVID is the first Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in patients with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm.

At present, there is ample commercial and clinical supply of ruxolitinib in the United States to meet the needs of U.S. patients receiving ruxolitinib in its approved indications and those participating in clinical trials. Incyte is increasing manufacturing efforts to respond to anticipated supply needs related to COVID-19 studies and working closely with distribution partners to monitor the supply of ruxolitinib.

<b>About COVID-19 Associated Cytokine Storm
</b>Cytokine storm is a severe immune overreaction that can be triggered by a viral infection and can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm who experience these complications often require intensive care, including intubation and the use of mechanical ventilation, and are at an increased risk of mortality.

Emerging evidence suggests that regulating overactive signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway during a cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 could be a potential treatment approach, and it is hypothesized that ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, may be able to play a role in treating these patients.

Currently, there is limited clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib for the treatment of COVID-19 associated cytokine storm, and ruxolitinib is not FDA-approved for this use.

<b>About RUXCOVID
</b>RUXCOVID is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 29-day, multi-center Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib plus standard of care (SoC) therapy in patients aged =12 years with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm compared to placebo plus SoC therapy.

The composite primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who die, develop respiratory failure (require mechanical ventilation), or require intensive care unit (ICU) care by Day 29. Secondary endpoints are comprised of various efficacy assessments including evaluation of clinical status using a 9-point ordinal scale; in-hospital outcomes (mortality rate; proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation; duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation); change in the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2); change in SpO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio; proportion of patients with no oxygen therapy (oxygen saturation of =94% on room air); and safety.

Eligible patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive oral ruxolitinib 5mg twice daily (BID) or oral-matching placebo for a total of 14 days. Study treatment will be given in combination with SoC therapy according to the investigator’s clinical judgement. After 14 days of therapy, should clinical signs or symptoms not improve or worsen, and the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks, patients may receive an additional 14 days of study therapy. In total, patients will be followed on study for 29 days post-randomization.

The RUXCOVID study is sponsored by Incyte in the United States, and Novartis outside of the United States.

<b>About the Ruxolitinib Expanded Access Program (EAP) in COVID-19
</b>The ruxolitinib Expanded Access Program (EAP) in COVID-19 for patients with severe COVID-19 associated cytokine storm allows eligible patients to receive ruxolitinib while it is being investigated in COVID-19 patients. Patients must be unable to participate in other clinical trials of ruxolitinib in COVID-19 to qualify for this EAP.

<strong>Esperion Therapeutics’ Commitment to Patients with Hyperlipidemia</strong>

High levels of LDL-C can lead to a build-up of fat and cholesterol in and on artery walls (known as atherosclerosis), potentially leading to cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke. In the U.S., 96 million people, or more than 37 percent of the adult population, have elevated LDL-C. There are approximately 18 million people in the U.S. living with elevated levels of LDL-C despite taking maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy — including individuals considered statin averse — leaving them at high risk for cardiovascular events.<sup>1</sup> In the United States, more than 50 percent of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) patients and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) patients who are not able to reach their guideline recommended LDL-C levels with statins alone need less than a 40 percent reduction to reach their LDL-C threshold goal.<sup>2</sup>

Esperion's mission as the Lipid Management Company is to deliver oral, once-daily medicines that complement existing oral drugs to provide the additional LDL-C lowering that these patients need.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 20, 2020-- <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alexion.com%2F&amp;esheet=52206225&amp;newsitemid=20200420005221&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Alexion+Pharmaceuticals%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=f164d8918b8f300c81531b00216fb6ce"" rel=""nofollow"">Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</a>(NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced plans to initiate a global Phase 3 study to investigate ULTOMIRIS<sup>®</sup> (ravulizumab-cwvz) in a subset of adults with COVID-19 – those who are hospitalized with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study is expected to enroll approximately 270 patients across countries with high numbers of diagnosed cases, beginning in May, and will evaluate the impact of ULTOMIRIS, a biologic medicine, on survival, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital stay compared to best supportive care. This follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) rapid review and acceptance of Alexion’s investigational new drug (IND) application for ULTOMIRIS for severe COVID-19.

“Alexion has been in close contact with physicians and global health authorities in an effort to rapidly evaluate the potential of C5 inhibition in treating patients with severe COVID-19,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research &amp; Development at Alexion. “Based on early anecdotal information available from compassionate use cases in multiple countries, we are launching a controlled clinical trial to evaluate the potential of ULTOMIRIS in mitigating the severe pneumonia and lung injury caused by the virus. As we move quickly to initiate this program, we also remain committed to serving the patients who currently rely on our medicines and providing continuous supply to these patients.”

The decision to begin this trial is based on a) published preclinical data suggesting that inhibition of terminal complement can lower cytokine and chemokine levels and significantly reduce lung inflammation and pathology in animal models of viral pneumonia<sup>i</sup>, and b) elevated complement biomarkers and promising preliminary clinical evidence from patients who have accessed SOLIRIS<sup>®</sup> (eculizumab) through our compassionate use program, which suggests that complement inhibition may improve coronaviral-mediated lung injury.

Independent investigators have expressed interest in studying the potential of C5 inhibition in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and we are aware of several ongoing or planned independent studies and anecdotal results from the use of our C5 inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. While these healthcare professionals continue to aggregate data regarding the potential of terminal complement inhibition in COVID-19 pneumonia from the approximately 100 patients who have been treated so far, Alexion believes that the outcomes reported to date warrant conducting a controlled clinical program to explore the impact of C5 inhibition with ULTOMIRIS and establish clinical evidence supporting the role of terminal complement in coronaviral pneumonia. We believe ULTOMIRIS represents the future of C5 inhibition, with its weight-based dosing, reduced burden on hospital systems due to less frequent dosing and it can be manufactured at a higher capacity, providing the opportunity to better meet future supply demands.

<b>About the Phase 3 Study</b>

The Phase 3 open-label, randomized, controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ULTOMIRIS in approximately 270 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and severe pneumonia, acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Study participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive ULTOMIRIS or best supportive care. The primary endpoint is survival at Day 29. Secondary endpoints will assess the need for mechanical ventilation, oxygenation, duration of ICU stay and hospitalization, and safety, among others.

Patients in the ULTOMIRIS arm will receive a weight-based loading dose of ULTOMIRIS on Day 1 (2400mg for patients weighing 40-60kg, 2700mg for 60-100kg, or 3000mg for =100kg). Follow-up dosing on Days 5, 10 and 15 will also be weight-based; patients weighing 40 to 60kg will receive 600mg of ULTOMIRIS and patients weighing 60kg or more will receive 900mg of ULTOMIRIS. All patients will continue to receive medications, therapies, and interventions per standard hospital treatment protocols for the duration of the study. Following the 4-week treatment period, there will be safety follow-up monitoring for three months.

<b>Expanded Access Programs</b>

In recognition of the urgent needs of some patients and in order to streamline the emergency access process, Alexion has opened emergency Expanded Access Programs (EAP) in the U.S. and France for SOLIRIS in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All requests for a hospital to be included in the EAP must be made by a treating physician and can be submitted to <a href=""mailto:covid.requests@alexion.com"" rel=""nofollow"">covid.requests@alexion.com</a>.

<b>Access &amp; Supply Considerations</b>

Alexion’s focus has always been on developing transformative medicines for patients with rare and ultra-rare diseases that typically affect several hundred to a few thousand patients worldwide. Like all of our medicines, ULTOMIRIS is a biologic medicine, which are very large complex molecules made up of genetically engineered proteins that are manufactured in living cells through a highly complicated process that requires significant time, expertise and precision. During this global health crisis, we have taken proactive measures that are designed to mitigate the risk of potential supply interruptions, and we strive to maintain sufficient inventory levels to continue serving current and new patients receiving our medicines for approved rare and ultra-rare indications as well as those participating in ongoing clinical trials.

We recognize that, should the role of C5 in treating severe respiratory complications of COVID-19 be demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial, there is the potential for significantly increased demand for our C5 inhibitors. We have taken steps to significantly increase future supply as part of our efforts to prepare for this and other potential scenarios that may arise so that we are ready to support access and the anticipated increased supply demand. In the meantime, Alexion will continue to monitor and manage the production of ULTOMIRIS, appropriately taking into consideration the needs of current and new patients, required inventory levels, anticipated potential supply needs related to COVID-19 and the time-intensive and complex manufacturing process to produce monoclonal antibodies while maintaining the company’s rigorous quality standards.

<b>About ULTOMIRIS<sup>®</sup> (ravulizumab-cwvz)</b>

ULTOMIRIS<sup>®</sup> (ravulizumab-cwvz) is the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor. The medication works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. For currently approved indications, ULTOMIRIS is administered intravenously every eight weeks or every four weeks for pediatric patients less than 20 kg, following a loading dose. ULTOMIRIS is approved in the United States (U.S.), European Union (EU) and Japan as a treatment for adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and in the U.S. for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients.

<b>INDICATIONS &amp; IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ULTOMIRIS<sup>®</sup>(ravulizumab-cwvz) AND SOLIRIS<sup>®</sup> (eculizumab)</b>

<b>INDICATIONS</b>

ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS are prescription medicines called monoclonal antibodies. ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS are used to treat adults with a disease called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS are also used to treat adults and children with a disease called atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). Neither ULTOMIRIS nor SOLIRIS is for use in treating people with Shiga toxin E. coli related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS).

In addition, SOLIRIS is used to treat adults with a disease called generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive. SOLIRIS is also used to treat adults with a disease called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive.

It is not known if ULTOMIRIS is safe and effective in children with PNH or in children younger than one month of age in aHUS. It is also not known if SOLIRIS is safe and effective in children with PNH, gMG, or NMOSD.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS are medicines that affect the immune system. These medicines can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Both medicines increase the chance of getting serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections. Meningococcal infections may quickly become life-threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early.

Meningococcal vaccines must be received at least two weeks before the first dose of ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS if the patient has not already had this vaccine. If the patient’s doctor decided that urgent treatment is needed, meningococcal vaccination should be administered as soon as possible. If the patient has not been vaccinated and therapy must be initiated immediately, two weeks of antibiotics should also be administered with the vaccinations. If the patient had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, additional vaccination might be needed before starting ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS. Patients should ask their doctor if an additional meningococcal vaccination is needed. Meningococcal vaccines reduce the risk of meningococcal infection but do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Patients should be instructed to call their doctor or get emergency medical care right away if any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection occur: headache with nausea or vomiting, headache and fever, headache with a stiff neck or stiff back, fever, fever and a rash, confusion, muscle aches with flu-like symptoms, and eyes sensitive to light. The doctor will provide a Patient Safety Card about the risk of meningococcal infection. This card must be carried at all times during treatment and for 8 months after the last ULTOMORIS dose or 3 months after the last SOLIRIS dose.

Before a patient can receive ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS, their doctor must: enroll in the corresponding <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fultomirisrems.com%2F&amp;esheet=52206225&amp;newsitemid=20200420005221&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=ULTOMIRIS+REMS&amp;index=3&amp;md5=f0a7b8e9317467458821bfb174f0baf8"" rel=""nofollow"">ULTOMIRIS REMS</a> or <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsolirisrems.com%2F&amp;esheet=52206225&amp;newsitemid=20200420005221&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=SOLIRIS+REMS&amp;index=4&amp;md5=f1448ed23883670f68139518e47872c7"" rel=""nofollow"">SOLIRIS REMS</a> program; counsel the patient about the risk of meningococcal infection; give the patient information and a Patient Safety Card about the symptoms and risk of meningococcal infection (as discussed above); and make sure that the patient is vaccinated with a meningococcal vaccine.

ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections. Patients should talk to their doctor right away if they have any new signs or symptoms of infection.

Patients must not receive ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS if they have a meningococcal infection, or if they have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection, unless their doctor decides that urgent treatment is needed.

Before a patient receives ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS, they should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they: have an infection or fever, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS will harm an unborn baby or if these medicines pass into the breast milk.

Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS can affect how other medicines work, causing side effects.

For patients with PNH, the doctor will need to monitor the patient closely for at least 16 weeks after stopping ULTOMIRIS or 8 weeks after stopping SOLIRIS. Stopping treatment with these medicines may cause breakdown of the red blood cells due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen due to red blood cell breakdown include: a drop in red blood cell count, tiredness, blood in the urine, stomach-area (abdomen) pain, shortness of breath, blood clots, trouble swallowing, and erectile dysfunction (ED) in males.

For patients with aHUS, the doctor will need to monitor closely during and for at least 12 months after stopping ULTOMIRIS, or 12 weeks after stopping SOLIRIS, for signs of worsening aHUS symptoms or problems related to abnormal clotting and breakdown of red blood cells called thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Symptoms or problems that can happen with TMA may include: confusion or loss of consciousness, seizures, chest pain (angina), difficulty breathing and blood clots or stroke.

ULTOMIRIS can cause serious side effects including infusion reactions. Symptoms of an infusion reaction with ULTOMIRIS may include lower back pain, pain with the infusion, feeling faint or discomfort in the arms or legs. Patients should tell their doctor or nurse right away if they develop these symptoms, or any other symptoms during their ULTOMIRIS infusion that may mean they are having a serious infusion reaction, including: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, and feel faint or pass out.

The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people treated for PNH are upper respiratory infection and headache. The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people with aHUS are upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, high blood pressure and fever.

SOLIRIS can cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions. Serious allergic reactions can happen during the SOLIRIS infusion. Patients should tell their doctor or nurse right away if they get any of these symptoms during the SOLIRIS infusion: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, and feeling faint or pass out. If a patient has an allergic reaction to SOLIRIS, the doctor may need to infuse SOLIRIS more slowly, or stop SOLIRIS.

The most common side effects in people with PNH treated with SOLIRIS include: headache, pain or swelling of the nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), back pain, and nausea. The most common side effects in people with aHUS treated with SOLIRIS include: headache, diarrhea, high blood pressure (hypertension), common cold (upper respiratory infection), stomach-area (abdominal) pain, vomiting, pain or swelling of the nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), low red blood cell count (anemia), cough, swelling of legs or feet (peripheral edema), nausea, urinary tract infections, and fever. The most common side effects in people with gMG treated with SOLIRIS include: muscle and joint (musculoskeletal) pain. The most common side effects in people with NMOSD treated with SOLIRIS include: common cold (upper respiratory infection); pain or swelling of the nose or throat (nasopharyngitis); diarrhea; back pain; dizziness; flu like symptoms (influenza) including fever, headache, tiredness, cough, sore throat, and body aches; joint pain (arthralgia); throat irritation (pharyngitis), and bruising (contusion).

Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Call your doctor right away if you miss an ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS infusion or for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

<div class=""itemstyle""><span class=""date"">20 April, 2020</span><em>RedHill is pursuing both RHB-107 and opaganib as potential treatments for COVID-19

</em>

<strong>TEL-AVIV, Israel and RALEIGH, N.C., April 20, 2020, </strong><a href=""https://www.redhillbio.com/RedHill/"">RedHill Biopharma Ltd.</a> (Nasdaq: <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RDHL?p=RDHL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"">RDHL</a>) (“RedHill” or the “Company”), a specialty biopharmaceutical company, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to provide its investigational drug, RHB-107 (upamostat, WX-671)<sup>1</sup>, for testing in non-clinical studies for activity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

RHB-107, an investigational new chemical entity, has been studied in more than 300 people across 10 clinical studies, including two completed Phase 2 studies in oncology patients and several Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and oncology patients. These studies helped establish the safety and tolerability of RHB-107 in humans. RHB-107 is a serine protease inhibitor active against a number of human trypsins and several other related serine proteases. Inhibition of serine proteases, including trypsins, may inhibit viral attachment and replication and decrease lung damage from viral pneumonia<sup>2</sup>.

RHB-107 was selected by NIAID for in vitro testing, following evaluation by NIAID of data on the drug’s possible mechanism of action and potential activity against SARS-CoV-2.

“RHB-107 is the second investigational drug that RedHill is evaluating for COVID-19, underscoring our commitment to the global efforts to develop a treatment for patients with this disease,” <strong>said Terry F. Plasse MD, Medical Director at RedHill. </strong>“This new agreement will facilitate pre-clinical evaluation of RHB-107 as a potential COVID-19 treatment.”

In parallel with the RHB-107 program, RedHill is evaluating another novel investigational drug, opaganib (Yeliva®, ABC294640), as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A compassionate use program of opaganib is underway in Israel, with several patients treated to date, with preliminary positive outcomes. In order to facilitate access to opaganib, various programs are currently under discussions in other countries and an Investigational New Drug (IND) application was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate opaganib in a clinical study in adults diagnosed with COVID-19 and pneumonia.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <a title=""Cue Biopharma, Inc."" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tFifDDmJ3xJnj4N-UPJK0R2GVD7M41ZCKy6IB53hWAAeObKmEg1Fyfd64qspkYAXBIx8TkykiqA-PZzAKZPOgFsSxhJjODkNGQvxuefIxic="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Cue Biopharma, Inc.</a> (NASDAQ: CUE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engineering a novel class of injectable biologics to selectively engage and modulate targeted T cells within the body, announced today it has entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), through a subsidiary, to evaluate the combination of Cue Biopharma’s investigational product candidate CUE-101, a first-in-class biologic, with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced head and neck cancer.

<strong>Collaboration with Merck</strong>
Under the terms of the agreement, Cue Biopharma will conduct a Phase 1 study, KEYNOTE-A78, evaluating CUE-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA in first-line HPV+ advanced head and neck cancer. KEYNOTE-A78 will be conducted in parallel with the ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy study of CUE-101 post first-line treatment. The early monotherapy PK data from the first two dosing cohorts demonstrates dose-related drug exposure consistent with preclinical modeling. Subsequent to the respective dose escalations, expansion cohorts evaluating CUE-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA will be conducted at optimized dosing regimens.

“We are very pleased to collaborate in this important study with Merck, an established leader in cancer immunotherapy, with our first clinical asset, CUE-101, which represents our IL-2 variant CUE-100 Series,” said Daniel Passeri, chief executive officer of Cue Biopharma. “Through the monotherapy and combination studies, we believe we will be able to demonstrate the mechanistic advantages of our approach and platform for modulating disease-relevant T cells directly in the patient’s body to safely enhance efficacy over current standards of care.”

“Immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment of patients with certain types of cancers. However significant unmet need remains – particularly in those individuals who do not respond or develop resistance to checkpoint therapy,” said Ken Pienta, M.D, acting chief medical officer of Cue Biopharma. “Based on a novel mechanism of action designed to induce and expand tumor-specific T cells in the patient’s body, we believe CUE-101 may lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity in combination with KEYTRUDA.”

CUE-101 is a fusion protein comprised of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, an HPV16 E7 peptide epitope, reduced affinity human interleukin-2 (IL-2) molecules, and an effector attenuated human immunoglobulin G (IgG1) Fc domain. In preclinical studies, CUE-101 has demonstrated selective induction and expansion of HPV16 E7-specific cytotoxic T cells with both in vitro and in vivo evidence supporting its potential for clinical efficacy both as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade.

KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.

<strong>Phase 1 Trial Update</strong>
The Phase 1 CUE-101 monotherapy study is ongoing, with enrollment of patients at 13 leading centers in the United States for the treatment of post first-line metastatic and recurrent HPV+ advanced head and neck cancer. We have initiated the dosing of 3 patients in Cohort 3 and pending safety evaluation, we anticipate initiating the dosing of patients in Cohort 4 later this quarter. By design, CUE-101 includes 4 molecules of attenuated IL-2 and Cohort 2 patients were exposed to drug concentrations equivalent to those achieved with systemic IL-2 administration of aldesleukin (Proleukin) with no evidence of cytokine release syndrome. The Phase 1 monotherapy portion of the study is a standard dose escalation of CUE-101. After demonstration of safety at several dose levels, a parallel Phase 1 dose escalation of CUE-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA will be initiated in first-line patients. The primary endpoints of the dose escalation phase of the trials are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of the two regimens. Monitoring of disease-relevant T cells and additional biomarkers of anti-tumor immune response and exploration of response prediction markers employing multiple methodologies are included in the study design.

Preliminary data from early patient cohorts demonstrates tolerability and drug exposure, and provides confidence for drug activity consistent with projections based on preclinical data. Cue Biopharma expects to report initial pharmacodynamic data from the Phase 1 monotherapy portion of the study in the first half of 2020.

<strong><em>Clinical Cancer Research </em>Publication</strong>
CUE-101 preclinical data were recently published in <em>Clinical Cancer Research, </em>a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. (<a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hPxdXHzFwl0zhdakdsEWWTd-o--T8Zr22o6_gqdgArWAwp2QYJi-oIOSeN8FguWmV0mF_78B3c16wpX7DhfJb-_vGHDhlq7AHAugAO1w19Lm3vrBX5HVfv2BTc5apbWVZevtlG1pJ-CUcSJqpXFCF3LVKEEN6iW9oRyGt22ugu9rU83ukGrhpwCm3fuCXmEO"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><u>https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/26/8/1953</u></a>)

The article titled, <em>CUE-101, a Novel HPV16 E7-pHLA-IL2-Fc Fusion Protein, Enhances Tumor Antigen Specific T Cell Activation for the Treatment of HPV16-Driven Malignancies</em>, includes CUE-101 data that demonstrate selective binding, activation and expansion of HPV16-specific, disease-relevant, T cells. A murine surrogate molecule (mCUE-101) administered to HPV16 E7 tumor bearing mice resulted in selective expansion of disease-relevant T cells, anti-cancer efficacy and immunologic memory. In addition, mCUE-101 administered as a combination therapy with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition further enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.

<strong>About the CUE-100 Series
</strong>The CUE-100 series consists of Fc-fusion biologics that incorporate peptide-MHC (pMHC) molecules along with rationally engineered IL-2 molecules. This singular biologic is anticipated to selectively target, activate and expand a robust repertoire of tumor-specific T cells directly in the patient. The binding affinity of IL-2 for its receptor has been deliberately attenuated to achieve preferential selective activation of tumor-specific effector T cells while reducing potential for effects on regulatory T cells (Tregs) or broad systemic activation, potentially mitigating the dose-limiting toxicities associated with current IL-2-based therapies.

<strong>About Immuno-STAT
</strong>Immuno-STAT™ biologics are designed for targeted modulation of disease-associated T cells in the areas of immuno-oncology and autoimmune disease. Each of our biologic drugs is designed using our proprietary scaffold comprising: 1) a peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) to provide selectivity through interaction with the T cell receptor (TCR), and 2) a unique co-stimulatory signaling molecule to modulate the activity of the target T cells.

The simultaneous engagement of co-regulatory molecules and pMHC binding mimics the signals delivered by antigen presenting cells (APCs) to T cells during a natural immune response. This design enables Immuno-STAT biologics to engage with the T cell population of interest, resulting in highly targeted T cell modulation. Because our drugs are delivered directly in the patient’s body (in vivo), they are fundamentally different from other T cell therapeutic approaches that require the patients’ T cells to be extracted, modified outside the body (ex vivo), and reinfused.

<strong>About Cue Biopharma</strong>
Cue Biopharma, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, is engineering a novel class of injectable biologics to selectively engage and modulate targeted T cells within the body to transform the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. The company’s proprietary platform, Immuno-STAT™ <em>(Selective Targeting and Alteration of T cells)</em> is designed to harness the body’s intrinsic immune system without the need for ex vivo manipulation.

Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we are led by an experienced management team and independent Board of Directors with deep expertise in the design and clinical development of protein biologics, immunology and immuno-oncology.

 	<li><strong>More than 99 percent of cervical cancers are caused by persistent high-risk HPV infection<sup>1</sup></strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Cervical cancer is nearly 100 percent preventable with proper HPV vaccination, screening and treatment; expanding access helps reach more women<sup>2,3</sup></strong></li>
 	<li><strong>cobas 6800/8800 Systems deliver full automation, helping laboratories meet the throughput and efficiencies that high-volume, HPV DNA screening programs require</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
Basel, 21 April 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX:RHHBY) today announced US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the cobas® HPV test for use on the fully automated, high-throughput cobas® 6800/8800 Systems. The cobas® HPV test identifies women at risk for cervical cancer by detecting the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in cervical samples. Persistent high-risk HPV infections can develop into precancerous lesions and, if left untreated, these lesions can progress to cervical cancer.

“The approval of our HPV test for the cobas 6800 and 8800 Systems enables molecular laboratories to achieve the efficiency and scale they need to meet the demands of high-volume cervical screening programs,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “This is critical as most healthcare providers in the US have adopted HPV testing as part of their cervical cancer screening protocol, with the ultimate goal of preventing cervical cancer in all women.”

The goal of cervical cancer screening is to find and treat precancer early to help stop the progression of disease. The cobas HPV test helps to protect women from the potential harms of undetected and untreated cervical disease by detecting the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers.

The cobas HPV test, previously approved for the cobas® 4800 System, is now part of the growing menu of clinically validated, FDA approved tests for use on cobas 6800/8800 Systems. Laboratories now have the ability to run HPV DNA tests simultaneously with other previously released cobas tests on these high-throughput systems.

The FDA considered data from the registrational IMPACT (IMproving Primary screening And Colposcopy Triage) trial, which enrolled almost 35,000 women in the US to clinically validate cobas HPV for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems. Study data will be broadly shared, pending publication of the key findings.

<strong>About cobas HPV test</strong>
cobas HPV is indicated for use for routine cervical cancer screening as per professional medical guidelines, including triage of ASC-US cytology, co-testing (or adjunctive screen) with cytology, and HPV primary screening of women to assess the risk for cervical precancer and cancer.

The cobas 4800 HPV Test, originally introduced in 2011 and supported by the ATHENA trial (Addressing the Need for Advanced HPV Diagnostics), helps healthcare providers identify women at risk for cervical cancer by individually identifying the presence of the DNA of HPV genotypes 16 and 18 – the two genotypes responsible for about 70 percent of all cervical cancers – and reporting the 12 other high-risk HPV types as a combined result, all in one test and from one patient sample. Roche received the first FDA approval to use an HPV test for primary cervical cancer screening without accompanying Pap cytology for the cobas HPV 4800 Test in 2014. More information about the cobas HPV tests is available at <a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dpC--hO15EnB0fTWDeG_e0G2f8jrPnfJ9hhhf0Hwry3a0yqjMZXTM4lzgjayLcfmGCp2kc5wHxp8QRWzfqBnOlOkewm-oLcijGErnurF2NI="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><u>www.hpv16and18.com</u></a>

<strong>About the Roche Cervical Cancer Portfolio
</strong>The Roche Cervical Cancer Portfolio enables healthcare professionals to better screen, triage and diagnose women, based on the confidence and clarity of results across a continuum of patient care. The unique combination of molecular, cellular and tissue-based tests provides healthcare professionals powerful information to make patient care decisions and minimize unnecessary treatment.<strong>

</strong>The Roche cobas 4800 HPV Test, used in combination with <a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ASIt90FU12J60QZugHC_X1Wfjg7rtN7MZLIfLyXc_mQvi2xppu_kCOfu0CroxbTuZr6TC3caZ4UP0QVZf_zYg6nacL-pzLP4iItskmaWWe2FuZm9EE9uYxhSvEj2hjweRf2808XcGDPQPz-vHwkVuoA_Xyp1li4oPUdf8RbyZEMpvGQ6IPKpp9OwZ9ghyTM1JK6cFQZ1lq8w4CdyZgO1LaboYghZfOARitjDerkWx70="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><u>CINtec® PLUS Cytology</u></a> and CINtec® Histology, offers clinicians and labs in the US powerful support they have not had before. The dual-stain biomarker technology included in the CINtec PLUS Cytology test, which was FDA approved in March 2020, detects the simultaneous presence within a single cell of the two biomarkers -- p16 and Ki-67. This abnormality is associated with HPV infections that are transforming and can, if left untreated, progress to pre-cancer or cancer. A positive result of these two biomarkers in a single cell signals that a woman is more significantly at risk for disease. The ability of CINtec PLUS Cytology to distinguish those women who are at higher risk for cervical disease provides labs, clinicians and women, in conjunction with the physician’s assessment of patient screening history, other risk factors, and professional guidelines information, to guide patient management. This could reduce the number and frequency of follow-up visits, saving worry, time and money.<strong>

</strong>CINtec Histology is the only FDA-cleared test used as an aid to confirm the presence of cervical disease in women who have had a tissue biopsy. The CINtec Histology test uses the p16 biomarker for a more conclusive diagnosis to provide distinctive visual confirmation of precancerous cervical lesions that may be missed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) interpretation alone.

</strong>Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the principal cause of cervical cancer in women, with HPV implicated in greater than 99 percent of cervical cancers worldwide. It can take 10 to 15 years or longer for cervical cancer to develop, so knowing a woman’s individual risk and finding disease early, before cancer develops, is an important prevention strategy. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates there are more than 570,000 new cases of cervical cancer annually, and 311,000 deaths<sup>4</sup>.<strong>

Highlights:
• NOX to seek approval from U.S. FDA for clinical study of Veyonda® in COVID-19
patients
• Objective to block progression of patients with early-stage disease into multi-organ
failure and likely death
• Rationale based on inhibition of STING signaling
Sydney, 21 April 2020: Noxopharm (NOX:ASX) previously (1 April 2020) announced a discovery
by the Hudson Institute of Medical Research (Hudson Institute) about a novel mode of action of
idronoxil, the active ingredient in Veyonda®. Noxopharm now is able to reveal that this mode of
action involves inhibition of the STING signalling pathway, a discovery that leads the Company
and the Hudson Institute to believe that Veyonda® holds potential to block the hyperinflammation stemming from the infection and which is believed responsible for deaths in
patients with COVID-19 infection.
1
The current announcement provides the market with an update on the action currently being
taken by the Company to act on that discovery.
Graham Kelly PhD, Noxopharm CEO, said, “With the emerging possibility that an abnormally
high STING response is a factor in COVID-19 death, having an inhibitor of STING signaling ready
to be tested in COVID-19 patients is both a considerable responsibility and opportunity. Proving
the value of Veyonda® to COVID-19 patients is both a humanitarian and regulatory approval
opportunity that we cannot overlook.”
“The need to prevent the phenomena of cytokine storm and septic shock in COVID-19 patients
looks likely to remain for some considerable time, and may even remain a long-term need
should development of an effective vaccine prove challenging.”
For Noxopharm, Veyonda® is first and foremost an oncology drug, with end-stage prostate
cancer remaining its primary focus. Any clinical studies in non-oncology patients will require
non-dilutive funding, something that the Company believes in the current environment should
be achievable once it receives the go-ahead to conduct a clinical study.

Suite 3, Level 4, 828 Pacific Highway, Gordon NSW 2072 AUSTRALIA
Regulatory strategy
Noxopharm currently is moving to obtain guidance from the FDA on the appropriate regulatory
approval pathway to pursue in the U.S. in relation to COVID-19 patients. The Company also is
pursuing the option of testing Veyonda® in patients suffering septic shock from a range of
infective agents other than the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Noxopharm has been developing an oral dosage formulation of idronoxil for some time and the
Company originally considered using an oral dosage form in non-oncology patients. However,
under advice, the Company will proceed instead with Veyonda®, given that product’s current
Investigational New Drug (IND) status in the U.S., on top of the considerable clinical experience
and data amassed with this dosage form. The provisional patent lodged in relation to use in
septic shock patients covers broad drug dosage forms including oral and suppository.
Rationale
The rationale is to use Veyonda® to block a process known as STING signaling, which in some
COVID-19 patients is thought to contribute to lethal self-destruction of major organs.
STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) is part of a primitive defence mechanism that detects
the presence of invading pathogenic organisms such as viruses or bacteria. In addition, STING
plays important roles in the clearance of damaged cells and tissues. Both responses involve the
production of proteins known as cytokines whose task it is to coordinate the subsequent
immune and tissue repair (inflammatory) responses.
STING engagement in the early stages of infections can contribute positively to the body’s
immune response to some pathogens. However, STING engagement becomes a negative and
self-destructive force if the infection persists and progresses to the point of causing extensive
tissue damage.2 Under those conditions, the STING pathway contributes to the so-called
‘cytokine storm’, along with the production of blood clotting factors, all promoting further
organ damage and forming the basis of the condition known as septic shock.
2
In COVID-19 patients, a trigger for this ‘cytokine storm’ or septic shock is mounting tissue
damage associated with poor oxygen levels (hypoxia) stemming from poor lung function,
3 with
this tissue damage believed responsible for triggering a toxic STING response.4 High levels of
cytokines and clotting factors are proving to be a predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients.
3
The Hudson Institute, in studies led by Dr Michael Gantier, discovered that idronoxil, the
active ingredient in Veyonda®, blocks the STING signalling pathway associated with cellular
damage of the kind caused by hypoxia.
Noxopharm Limited. ABN 50 608 966 123
Suite 3, Level 4, 828 Pacific Highway, Gordon NSW 2072 AUSTRALIA
Dr Michael Gantier, head of the Nucleic Acids and Innate Immunity laboratory, said, “We
have shown that idronoxil is a very potent inhibitor of STING signaling in cell-based assays using
STING agonists, and also in the context of cellular damage caused by a chemotherapy agent.
The inhibitory activities measured were measured in the sub-micromolar range, on par with
other inhibitors recently reported.5
Competitive landscape
To address the ‘cytokine storm’ phenomenon, clinical trials are in progress in COVID-19 patients
with drugs that block the function of individual cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Those
studies will show whether blocking individual cytokines out of the large number involved in a
‘cytokine storm’ will have any meaningful effect.
Noxopharm believes that a more rational approach is an upstream approach to block the
‘cytokine storm’ process at its roots by inhibiting the STING pathway, offering the potential of
blocking the production of a broad range of cytokines and holding the promise of halting the
rapid deterioration of COVID-19 patients once they develop poor lung function.
The infancy in understanding the critical role of STING in inflammation and septic shock has
meant that clinical studies of STING inhibitors have yet to get underway. Noxopharm is in the
position of having a clinic-ready drug candidate to test the potential value of blocking STING
signaling in COVID-19 patients.
Veyonda® also has the advantage of having addressed the issue of safety by proving to be
well-tolerated in patients with advanced cancers and poor quality of life.
About COVID-19 deaths
The danger with COVID-19 infection lies in its progression from a mild disease into an overwhelming and
fulminant condition characterised by respiratory failure, multi-organ failure (heart and kidney failure),
clotting problems and septic shock. Treatment at that end-stage is limited to supportive treatment
including antibiotics and the use of ventilators. To date there is no approved treatment for COVID-19
related disease and the death rate continues to be very high in these patients.
Cytokines are proteins secreted by immune cells and which trigger inflammation and tissue repair. These
include interleukins (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon beta (IFN?). Cytokine
levels in blood rise in response to COVID-19 infection but undergo extreme rise in a small proportion of
patients in what is known as ‘cytokine storm’, with this extreme rise being highly predictive of death.3
About Idronoxil and cancer
Idronoxil is a small molecule with multiple anti-cancer mechanisms. Inhibition of the sphingosine-1-
phosphate (S1P) and STING signalling pathways are thought to be the two principal factors, both playing
key roles in regulating the immunological and inflammatory responses in tumours.
Noxopharm Limited. ABN 50 608 966 123
Suite 3, Level 4, 828 Pacific Highway, Gordon NSW 2072 AUSTRALIA
S1P is a key master driver of pro-survival mechanisms in all cells and is over-expressed in most tumour
cells.6
Idronoxil inhibits S1P production via inhibition of the ENOX2-sphingosine kinase axis.
The STING signalling pathway can directly contribute to cancer development and metastasis by initiating
pro-tumorigenic inflammation.7-10

CAMBRIDGE, England &amp; BRISBANE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 21, 2020-- Mogrify Ltd (Mogrify<sup>®</sup>), a UK company aiming to transform the development of cell therapies by the systematic discovery of novel cell conversions, and Sangamo Therapeutics (Sangamo) (Nasdaq: SGMO), a genomic medicine company, today announced that they have executed a collaboration and exclusive license agreement for Sangamo to develop allogeneic cell therapies from Mogrify’s proprietary induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and Sangamo’s zinc finger protein (ZFP) gene-engineered chimeric antigen receptor regulatory T cell (CAR-Treg) technology.
<p id=""news-body-cta"">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200421005170/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200421005170/en/</a></p>
“Mogrify is delighted to announce its second commercial deal with a US biopharma and the first in the exciting field of T cell immunotherapy,” said Dr. Darrin M. Disley OBE, CEO, Mogrify. “The combination of Mogrify’s proprietary systematic cell conversion technology and Sangamo’s regulatory T cell platform and proprietary ZFP platform is a natural fit. Sangamo is at the forefront of the development of a world-class engineered ZFP genome editing platform and we are very happy to be partnering with such an innovative company.”

“This license agreement provides Sangamo with access to Mogrify’s cell conversion technology, which will diversify our options as we develop off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR-Treg cell therapies,” said Jason Fontenot, SVP, Head of Cell Therapy at Sangamo. “We expect this collaboration to accelerate our development of scalable and accessible CAR-Treg cell therapies, so that we can potentially deliver treatments to patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases more rapidly.”

Mogrify’s technology enables the transformation of any human cell type into any other human cell type. This transformation is achieved using transcription factors or small molecules identified using proprietary big data technologies. iPSCs and ESCs provide an evergreen starting material for the generation of Tregs, and facilitate more complex engineering and greater manufacturing scalability, potentially enabling the resulting therapies to be more cost-effective and thus more accessible to larger patient populations.

Under the terms of the agreement, Mogrify will be responsible for the discovery and optimization of the cell conversion technology from iPSCs or ESCs to regulatory T cells, and Sangamo will be granted exclusive rights to use Mogrify’s technology to create Tregs from iPSCs or ESCs. Sangamo expects to then use its ZFP gene-engineering technology and therapeutic development capabilities to transform these Tregs into novel “off-the-shelf” allogeneic CAR-Treg cell therapy candidates and hopes to take them through clinical development through to registration for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

Under the terms of the agreement, Sangamo will pay Mogrify an upfront payment. Mogrify is also eligible to receive potential additional payments related to development and regulatory milestones, and product sales.

Mogrify is deploying this platform to develop novel cell therapies addressing musculoskeletal, auto-immune, cancer immunotherapy, ocular and respiratory diseases as well as generating a broad IP position relating to cell conversions that exhibit safety, efficacy and scalable manufacturing profiles suitable for development as cell therapies.

Uniquely positioned to address a cell therapy market estimated to be $35 billion USD by 2023, Mogrify is commercializing its technology via IP licensing, product development, and drug development. Based in Cambridge, UK, the Company has raised over $20 million USD funding from Ahren Innovation Capital, Parkwalk, 24Haymarket, Dr. Darrin M. Disley, OBE and the University of Bristol Enterprise Fund III.

<strong>Basel, April 21, 2020</strong> — Novartis announced today new Mayzent<sup>®</sup> (siponimod) data in the April supplemental issue of <em>Neurology<sup>®</sup>, </em>the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The data build on existing clinical evidence that Mayzent has proven to slow physical disability progression and provide cognitive benefits in people living with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS)<sup>1</sup>. Although every patient’s multiple sclerosis (MS) journey is unique, 1 in 4 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients on treatment transition to SPMS within 10 years of RRMS onset*<sup>4</sup>.

Data released from the five-year EXPAND open-label extension trial assessed the long-term efficacy and safety of Mayzent in patients with SPMS who on entering the extension trial either continued on Mayzent treatment (Mayzent group) or switched from placebo to Mayzent (placebo switch group). Patients in the Mayzent group were significantly less likely to experience both three- and six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) (p=0.0064 and p=0.0048, respectively) compared with the placebo switch group, which underscores advantages of early treatment initiation<sup>1</sup>. These data were included in the April supplemental issue of <em>Neurology</em> after the <a class=""ext extlink"" title=""2020 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting"" href=""https://www.aan.com/conferences-community/annual-meeting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">2020 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting</a> was cancelled due to COVID-19.

“The data continue to show that Mayzent has the ability to help patients maintain independence for longer through its long-term effect on delaying progression and cognitive impairment,” said Norman Putzki, MD, Global Head of Development Neuroscience. “Novartis is committed to reimagining medicine for patients with progressive diseases and with Mayzent, Novartis offers patients hope for improved health outcomes.”

The new data also show a 52% reduction in the annualized relapse rate (ARR) observed in the Mayzent group compared to the placebo switch group (p&lt;0.0001). Risk of confirmed worsening of cognitive impairment (according to the Symbol Digit Modalities Test) at six-months was reduced by 23% for the Mayzent group compared with placebo switch group (p=0.0014). The benefits seen in the Mayzent group were sustained for up to five years, underscoring the advantages of early treatment initiation
with Mayzent. The incidence of adverse events was consistent with the controlled treatment period<sup>1</sup>. This EXPAND open-label extension is ongoing for up to a total of seven years.

Additional Mayzent data shared in the same <em>Neurology</em> issue includes a new post-hoc analysis from EXPAND, which showed Mayzent consistently reduced cortical grey matter (cGM) and thalamic atrophy in patients with SPMS, including those with less active and more advanced disease. Across the subgroups studied, Mayzent reduced cGM atrophy versus placebo by 48–116% (p&lt;0.01 at both M12 and M24) and thalamic atrophy by 30– 68% (p&lt;0.05 at both M12 and M24; except for ‘disease duration &gt;15 years’ p=0.1029 at M12)<sup>2</sup>. Combined with other analyses, these findings could translate into a favorable impact on long-term clinical outcomes including disability progression and cognitive decline.

Further analysis from EXPAND, evaluating Mayzent’s effect on magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) changes in patients with SPMS, builds on existing pre-clinical evidence that suggests Mayzent may promote repair mechanisms in the central nervous system (CNS). MTR is a technique widely used for estimating myelin content in the brain. MTR results show that Mayzent significantly reduces de-myelination and substantiate previous pre-clinical findings on remyelination<sup>5</sup>.

“These data highlight the critical importance of early treatment intervention with a disease-modifying treatment, such as Mayzent, to ensure the best possible long-term outcomes for patients with MS who are experiencing progression,” said Bruce Cree, MD, PhD, MAS, Clinical Research Director and George A. Zimmermann Endowed Professor in Multiple Sclerosis, University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine. “It’s never too early to stay ahead of progression in multiple sclerosis, since the early identification of physical and cognitive changes – even subtle ones – can indicate MS disease progression and therefore allow for timely intervention.”

<em>*For specific indications of Mayzent approved in each country, see the section “About Mayzent® (siponimod)” below.</em>

<sup>‡</sup><em>Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is defined as a first episode of neurologic symptoms that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation or demyelination in the central nervous system<sup>6</sup>.</em>

<strong>About</strong><strong> the EXPAND Study<sup>7</sup></strong>
EXPAND is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study, comparing the efficacy and safety of Mayzent versus placebo in people with SPMS with varying levels of disability (Core Part), EDSS scores of 3·0–6·5, followed by extended treatment with open-label BAF312 to obtain data on long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy (Extension Part)<sup>8</sup>. It is the largest randomized, controlled study in SPMS to date, including 1,651 people with a diagnosis of SPMS from 31 countries. Mayzent demonstrated a safety profile that was overall consistent with the known effects of S1P receptor modulation. It reduced the risk of three-month CDP by a statistically significant 21% (p=0.013; primary endpoint). CDP was defined as a 1-point increase in EDSS, if the baseline score was 3·0–5·0, or a 0·5-point increase, if the baseline score was 5·5–6·5. No significant differences were found in the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test. T2 lesion volume was reduced by 79% as compared to placebo. Additional secondary endpoints included a relative reduction in the ARR by 55%, and compared to placebo, more patients were free from Gd-enhancing lesions (89% vs 67% for placebo) and from new or enlarging T2 lesions (57% vs 37% for placebo). Additional exploratory analyses presented at the 35<sup>th</sup>Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), demonstrated Mayzent can help patients keep their mobility for over four years longer on average<sup>9†</sup>.

<strong>About Mayzent<sup>®</sup> (siponimod)</strong>
Mayzent is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that selectively binds to S1P1 and S1P5 receptors. In relation to the S1P1 receptor, it prevents the lymphocytes from egressing the lymph nodes and as a consequence, from entering the CNS of patients with MS<sup>7</sup>. This leads to the anti-inflammatory effects of Mayzent<sup>10</sup>. Mayzent also enters the CNS and binds to the S1P5 sub-receptor on specific cells in the CNS<sup>11,12,13</sup>, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and has shown pro-remyelinating and neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of MS<sup>14,15,16</sup>.

In the European Union (EU), Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with SPMS with active disease evidenced by relapsing or imaging features of inflammatory activity. In the US, Mayzent is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to include clinically isolated syndrome (CIS<sup>‡</sup>), relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults. The approvals are based on the Phase III EXPAND trial, the largest controlled clinical study of a broad range of SPMS patients, showing Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of disease progression, including impact on physical disability and cognitive decline<sup>7</sup>. Mayzent is also approved in Australia and Albania for adult patients with SPMS and in Canada and United Arab Emirates for adult patients with active SPMS. Novartis is committed to bringing Mayzent to patients worldwide, and additional regulatory filings are currently underway in Switzerland, Japan, China, and elsewhere.

<strong>About Multiple Sclerosis</strong>
MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss<sup>17</sup>. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide<sup>18</sup>, is often characterized into three forms: primary progressive MS (PPMS)<sup>19</sup>, RRMS, and SPMS, which follows from an initial RRMS course and is characterized by physical and cognitive changes over time, in presence or absence of relapses, leading to a progressive accumulation of neurological disability<sup>20</sup>. Approximately 85% of patients initially present with relapsing forms of MS<sup>18</sup>. There remains a high unmet need for safe and effective treatments to help delay disability progression in SPMS with active disease (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity)<sup>20</sup>.

<strong>About Novartis in MS</strong>
In addition to Mayzent, the Novartis MS portfolio includes also Gilenya<sup>®</sup>(fingolimod, an S1P modulator), which is indicated in the EU for the treatment of adult patients and children and adolescents 10 years of age and older with RRMS. In the United States, Gilenya is approved for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with RMS, to include CIS, relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease.

Ofatumumab (OMB157), a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets B-cells, is in development for treating RMS. Positive Phase III data presented in September 2019 show ofatumumab met primary endpoints to reduce the ARR in patients with RMS<sup>21</sup>. If approved, ofatumumab will potentially become a treatment for a broad RMS population and the first subcutaneous B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home.

Extavia<sup>®</sup> (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is approved in the US for RMS, to include CIS, relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. In Europe, Extavia is approved to treat people with RRMS, SPMS with active disease and people who have had a single clinical event suggestive of MS.

In the US, the Sandoz Division of Novartis markets Glatopa<sup>®</sup> (glatiramer acetate injection) 20mg/mL and 40mg/mL, generic versions of Teva's glatiramer acetate.

<b>Berlin, April 21, 2020</b> – Bayer announced today its Canadian organization Bayer Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, will partner with the Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) in launching a major clinical research program aimed at identifying potential treatments against COVID-19. The two studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of different combination therapies including <span style=""font-family: Arial"">Bayer’s</span>chloroquine and interferon beta-1b.

“Treatments against COVID-19 are urgently needed as no validated options are currently available,” said Dr. Mike Devoy, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG's Pharmaceuticals Division and Chief Medical Officer. “We want to contribute to the global fight against the coronavirus through our products and expertise and look forward to partnering with the PHRI.”

Bayer will make a financial commitment of CAD 1.5 million (approx. 1 million euros) towards the studies and will supply study drugs to support the research. This adds to the CAD 0.5 million committed by the PHRI earlier this month which enabled the development of the research program.

“Specifically, an outpatient study will evaluate the combination of chloroquine with azithromycin to see if this treatment can prevent deterioration leading to hospital admission, while a second study will evaluate the combination of chloroquine with azithromycin, as well as interferon beta-1b, to prevent admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation and/or death to combat COVID-19,” said Salim Yusuf, Executive Director of PHRI. “Our goal is to assess the value of these and other therapies rapidly so that the results can inform practice as soon as possible.”

PHRI plans to enroll 6,000 patients into the two studies from more than 60 contributing research sites across the Canadian province of Ontario and internationally.

“Ontario is home to world-class researchers who are continually furthering our understanding within the health sciences and finding new ways to keep our communities healthy and safe,” said Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities of the Government of Ontario. “I want to thank Bayer, the Population Health Research Institute, and all of our research community for their critical work to limit the impact of COVID-19. I know that, because of your efforts, we will emerge from this stronger than ever.”

<b>About the investigational treatments</b>
Developed by Bayer in the 1930s, chloroquine (trade name: Resochin<span style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: large"">™</span>) was used in the prevention of malaria for decades. The Chinese health authorities have included chloroquine in the treatment recommendations for COVID-19. Subsequently, many other health authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have adopted similar guidance for supervised emergency use of chloroquine outside of the established indications.

As peer-reviewed and published clinical data are currently not available for chloroquine in the COVID-19 treatment setting, Bayer is working with researchers, governments and front-line practitioners to support generation and exchange of data to help to close this knowledge gap.

In addition, Bayer is donating chloroquine tablets to health authorities in different countries to allow for coordinated and emergency use of the drug outside of the established indications under the guidance of physicians.

In addition to looking into the potential of chloroquine, Bayer is actively participating in several global coalitions supporting research for drugs and treatment strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

Interferon beta-1b in a recombinant form is one of the marketed interferon beta formulations (brand name Betaseron/Betaferon<sup>®</sup>). This was the first drug to show in multiple sclerosis (MS) a decrease in relapse rate and to reduce MS disease activity as measured by MRI in clinical studies. These findings led to its approval by the FDA as the first therapy for treatment of the former orphan’s disease MS in 1993. Approvals by other agencies around the world followed subsequently.

Azithromycin is an antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections including strep throat and pneumonia, as well as travellers’ diarrhea and certain other intestinal infections. Along with other medications, it may also be used for malaria. Azithromycin was first approved for medical use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b><i>-- Collaboration to Leverage oNKo-innate’s Deep Expertise in NK Cell Tumor Biology to Discover Novel Therapies in Immuno-Oncology and Cell Therapy --</i></b></p>
FOSTER CITY, Calif. &amp; SANTA MONICA, Calif. &amp; MELBOURNE, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 21, 2020--Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD), Kite, a Gilead Company, and oNKo-innate announced the companies have entered into a three-year cancer immunotherapy research collaboration to support discovery and development of next-generation drug and engineered cell therapies focused on natural killer (NK) cells.
<p id=""news-body-cta"">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200421005271/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200421005271/en/</a></p>
Current cancer immunotherapy approaches primarily focus on T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity, including checkpoint inhibition and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Like T cells, NK cells are a class of lymphocytes (white blood cells) that play a critical surveillance and effector role in the immune system. NK cells and T cells each have the potential to attack cancer cells, but have different mechanisms for tumor cell killing. Thus, appropriately activated and targeted NK cells may represent a differentiated approach that would be potentially complementary and synergistic with T cell mediated anti-tumor strategies.

“Gilead is pleased to partner with oNKo-innate as a leader in this new and highly promising area of cancer immunotherapy,” said William A. Lee, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, Gilead Sciences. “We have a strategic focus of growing both our expertise and pipeline in immuno-oncology and we believe this exciting collaboration will support each of these objectives as we work to discover and develop novel cancer therapies for patients.”

“Kite is committed to building upon our leadership in cell therapy as we seek to meet the needs of patients with cancer,” said Peter Emtage, PhD, Senior Vice President of Research at Kite. “Early clinical data utilizing adoptively transferred NK cells has been encouraging and we are excited by the opportunity to scientifically expand our capabilities in this area and to identify novel NK cell therapies to advance toward clinical development.”

“With more than 20 years of collective academic expertise in NK cell biology, we have long believed in the potential for NK cells to play a role in cancer immunotherapy,” said Jai Rautela, PhD, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of oNKo-innate. “We look forward to bringing this NK cell expertise and our unique screening techniques into a collaboration with Gilead and Kite to serve a common goal of discovering new treatments for patients.”

Through this research collaboration, oNKo-innate will use genome-wide screening techniques and its proprietary technology platform to discover novel immune cell targets that enhance NK cell anti-tumor immunity and to create NK cell therapies. For Gilead, oNKo-innate will execute screens to identify and validate targets to seed internal Gilead immuno-oncology discovery programs. For Kite, oNKo-innate will create and evaluate NK constructs for Kite’s development of next-generation cell therapies.

Under the terms of the agreement, oNKo-innate will receive an upfront payment and will be eligible to receive additional payments based on achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as sales royalties across the immuno-oncology and cell therapy programs.

<strong>Basel, April 22, 2020</strong> — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to Kymriah<sup>®</sup> (tisagenlecleucel), for an investigational new indication to treat patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL). Kymriah, which is designed to be a one-time treatment, is the first-ever FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy. The potential approval in r/r FL will be the third indication for Kymriah, which also has indications in r/r pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and r/r adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

“This designation supports the advancement of Kymriah, which could potentially address an unmet need in certain patients with follicular lymphoma, as we strive to reimagine medicine at Novartis. These patients are often faced with the burden of several years of various treatments as their disease continues to progress.” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis.

Follicular lymphoma, the second most common form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL)<sup>1,2</sup>, is an indolent lymphoma, and represents approximately 22% of NHL cases<sup>1</sup>. Despite new treatments that improve overall survival, FL is regarded as an incurable malignancy with a relapsing and remitting pattern<sup>3</sup>. Although patients in third or later line treatment for FL have multiple systemic therapies available, the efficacy of these regimens drops off rapidly in later lines<sup>4</sup>. Throughout the lifetime of a relapsing FL patient, they may be exposed to a median of five lines of prior treatment, with an upper range of 12 lines<sup>5,6</sup>. There also is an unmet need in people who are refractory to treatment or quickly relapse, who may exhaust treatment options while they are still healthy enough to receive active treatment<sup>4</sup>.

The RMAT designation program is part of the 21st Century Cures Act. The program was created to expedite the development and review of regenerative medicine therapies intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious condition. The FDA granted RMAT designation for Kymriah in FL based on preliminary clinical evidence from the ELARA clinical trial, an ongoing multi-center, phase II study to determine the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL.

Kymriah was developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a strategic alliance between industry and academia which was first-of-its-kind in CAR-T research and development.

<strong>Kymriah<sup>®</sup> (tisagenlecleucel) US Important Safety information</strong>
Kymriah may cause side effects that are severe or life-threatening, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or Neurological Toxicities. Patients with CRS may experience symptoms including difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, or dizziness/lightheadedness. Patients may be admitted to the hospital for CRS and treated with other medications.

Patients with neurological toxicities may experience symptoms such as altered or decreased consciousness, headaches, delirium, confusion, agitation, anxiety, seizures, difficulty speaking and understanding, or loss of balance. Patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if they experience any of these signs and symptoms of CRS or neurological toxicities.

Because of the risk of CRS and neurological toxicities, Kymriah is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called Kymriah REMS.

Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur after Kymriah infusion. Kymriah can increase the risk of life-threatening infections that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they develop fever, chills, or any signs or symptoms of an infection.

Patients may experience prolonged low blood cell counts (cytopenia), where one or more types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets) are decreased. The patient's healthcare provider will do blood tests to check all of their blood cell counts after treatment with Kymriah. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they get a fever, are feeling tired, or have bruising or bleeding.

Patients may experience hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition in which the level of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood is low and the risk of infection is increased. It is expected that patients may develop hypogammaglobulinemia with Kymriah, and may need to receive immunoglobulin replacement for an indefinite amount of time following treatment with Kymriah. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their treatment with Kymriah before receiving a live virus vaccine.

After treatment with Kymriah, patients will be monitored lifelong by their healthcare provider, as they may develop secondary cancers or recurrence of their cancer.

Patients should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities for eight weeks after receiving Kymriah because the treatment can cause temporary memory and coordination problems, including sleepiness, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and seizures.
Some of the most common side effects of Kymriah are difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, confusion, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, dizziness/lightheadedness, and headache. However, these are not all of the possible side effects of Kymriah. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.

Prior to a female patient starting treatment with Kymriah, their healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test. There is no information available for Kymriah use in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Therefore, Kymriah is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and pregnancy.

Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
After receiving Kymriah, patients should be advised that some commercial HIV tests may cause a false-positive test result. Patients should also be advised not to donate blood, organs, or tissues and cells for transplantation after receiving Kymriah.

These characteristics make them a potential therapeutic option to fight the inflammation and lung degeneration that is known to occur in severe COVID-19 patients. In this study, patients suffering severe symptoms associated with COVID-19 will have the opportunity to receive HB-adMSCs, in addition to current standard of care. The data generated in this study will determine the role HB-adMSCs may play in decreasing the severity of illness from COVID-19 infection. “Our goal is to keep severely ill patients from needed invasive mechanical ventilation. We know that the probability of survival greatly decreases once a patient is invasively ventilated for this disease. Providing HB-adMSCs will help the patient’s immune system resist the damage associated with COVID-19 and aid in repair. If we can prevent patients from needing ventilators, we can increase the probability of survival,” said Donna Chang, Founder and President of Hope Biosciences.

This Phase II study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single center study that is expected to enroll 110 hospitalized patients into 2 separate arms. Participants taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin will be randomized into a placebo or treatment group. Likewise, patients not taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin will also be randomized into a placebo or treatment group. Those receiving treatment will receive 4 doses of 100 million HB-adMSCs over a 10-day period.

<p align=""justify"">MAINZ, Germany and NEW YORK, April 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech” or “the Company”) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), have announced today that the German regulatory authority, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, has approved the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for BioNTech’s BNT162 vaccine program to prevent COVID-19 infection. BioNTech and Pfizer are jointly developing BNT162. The trial is the first clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate to start in Germany, and is part of a global development program. Pfizer and BioNTech will also conduct trials for BNT162 in the United States upon regulatory approval, which is expected shortly.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The four vaccine candidates are the first candidates from BioNTech’s COVID-19-focused project “Lightspeed”, each representing different mRNA formats and target antigens. Two of the four vaccine candidates include a nucleoside modified mRNA (modRNA), one includes a uridine containing mRNA (uRNA), and the fourth vaccine candidate utilizes self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA). Each mRNA format is combined with a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. The larger spike sequence is included in two of the vaccine candidates, and the smaller optimized receptor binding domain (RBD) from the spike protein is included in the other two candidates. The RBD-based candidates contain the piece of the spike that is thought to be most important for eliciting antibodies that can inactivate the virus.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The dose escalation portion of the Phase 1/2 trial will include approximately 200 healthy subjects between the ages of 18 to 55 and will target a dose range of 1 µg to 100 µg aiming to determine the optimal dose for further studies as well as evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. The study will also evaluate the effects of repeated immunization for three of the four vaccine candidates which utilize uRNA or modRNA. Subjects with a higher risk for a severe COVID-19 infection will be included in the second part of the study.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are pleased to have completed pre-clinical studies in Germany and will soon initiate this first-in-human trial ahead of our expectations. The speed with which we were able to move from the start of the program to trial initiation speaks to the high level of engagement from everyone involved,” says <strong>CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin.</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">“Pfizer and BioNTech’s partnership has mobilized our collective resources with extraordinary speed in the face of this worldwide challenge,” said <strong>Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO</strong>. “Now that the work in Germany can commence, we are looking forward to and actively preparing for the potential start of this unique and robust clinical study program in the United States in the near future.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">During the clinical development stage, BioNTech will provide its partners clinical supply of the vaccine from its GMP-certified mRNA manufacturing facilities in Europe.</p>
<p align=""justify"">BioNTech is also collaborating with Fosun Pharma to develop BNT162 in China, where the companies  expect to conduct trials.</p>

Sobi™ has today announced the launch by its affiliate, Florio GmbH, of Florio®, a digital medical device designed with the aim to improve the quality of life for people with haemophilia.

Consisting of a smartphone app which can be combined with a wearable device and a web-based dashboard for physicians, Florio allows patients to track, monitor and share data relating to their health in real-time with their health care teams to enable personalised care.

The new technology is intended to enable meaningful discussions between physicians and people living with haemophilia, aimed at reducing the uncertainty around treatment so patients with haemophilia are able to lead full and active lives. Florio was developed with extensive input from both health care professionals and people with haemophilia, further supporting Sobi's long term commitment to the community.

""The ability for patients to share comprehensive personalised data with physicians in real-time is an important step towards reaching our Liberate Life vision for haemophilia, and through Florio, can create enormous value for the community. Florio and Liberate Life both embody our dedication to people living with haemophilia, which involves protecting them from bleeds, joint pains and mental burdens - helping them feel safe so they can live a life without compromise,"" said CEO and President of Sobi, Guido Oelkers.

Florio was developed by Florio GmbH, Munich, Germany, an affiliate within Sobi established as a separate company to ensure data privacy. Dr. Ruediger Jankowsky is leading Florio GmbH as the General Manager.

""I'm delighted to become a part of such an innovative company with a clear vision for the future of haemophilia treatment. This is a fantastic opportunity to facilitate the sharing of rich sets of data between patients and physicians that could enable truly personalised care. I look forward to building on the great work the Sobi and Florio teams have already accomplished, aiming to improve the outcomes for anyone affected by haemophilia,"" he<strong> </strong>said.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","The European Commission has approved, under the EU Merger Regulation, the proposed merger between the global pharmaceutical company Mylan and Upjohn, a business division of Pfizer, which operates Pfizer’s off-patent branded and generic established medicines. The decision is conditional on the divestment of Mylan’s business for certain generic medicines.

The transaction will lead to the combination of Mylan, one of the top five generic suppliers in the EEA with the originator Upjohn, whose products have lost exclusivity following patent expiries.

Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, responsible for competition policy, said: “Ensuring that patients and hospitals have access to medicines at fair and competitive prices, as well as ensuring security of supply, is always a key priority which resonates even more strongly in the current challenging context. Our decision ensures that the merger between Mylan and Upjohn does not harm competition, thus preserving competitive access to certain genericised medicines for national health services and European citizens”.

The Commission’s investigation

The Commission’s investigation focused on the market for genericised medicines, which are sold to pharmacies and hospitals. Mylan and Upjohn overlap in various therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular, genito-urinary, musculoskeletal, nervous system, and sensory organ treatments.

The Commission found that for the genericised medicines involved in this case, competition between suppliers typically takes place (i) at the national level, given the differing national regulatory/reimbursement schemes and competitive dynamics between pharmaceutical suppliers, (ii) between medicines using the same chemical molecule as an active pharmaceutical ingredient for a specific therapeutic indication. Generally, the molecules covered by the investigation are not interchangeable with other molecules for patients or health practitioners and should therefore be assessed separately.

The Commission’s investigation found that no competition concerns arise for the majority of the products supplied by both Mylan and Upjohn. However, in some countries and for some molecules, the Commission found the transaction would raise competition concerns because of the strong position of the two companies and the limited number of significant competitors on the market. In particular, concerns were found for 36 molecule-country pairs as indicated in the table below:

Molecules

Countries

Alprazolam

Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal

Atorvastatin

Norway

Doxazosin

Czechia, France

Eletriptan

Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, Sweden

Eplerenone

Belgium, Hungary

Gabapentin

Ireland

Latanoprost

Belgium, Luxembourg

Latanoprost/timolol

Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal

Pregabalin

Belgium, Czechia, Luxembourg, Norway

Sildenafil (for pulmonary arterial hypertension)

Estonia, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, United Kingdom

Venlafaxine

Belgium

Ziprasidone

Czechia

The Commission also investigated the vertical relationships between Mylan and Upjohn With respect to (i) active pharmaceutical ingredients and (ii) out-licensing which are both upstream to the supply of genericised medicines. The Commission concluded that no competition concerns arise in this regard.

The commitments

To address these concerns, Mylan and Upjohn offered to divest to one or more suitable purchasers, Mylan’s business in the relevant markets, including the applicable marketing authorisations, contracts and brands, as well as transitory manufacturing and supply arrangements. These include certain generic medicines across 20 countries throughout the EEA and the UK.

The proposed commitments remove the entire overlaps between Mylan and Upjohn in the markets raising serious doubts and fully address all of the Commission’s competition concerns.

The Commission therefore concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, would no longer raise competition concerns in the EEA. The decision is conditional upon full compliance with the commitments.

Companies and products

Mylan, based in the Netherlands, is a vertically-integrated global pharmaceutical company that develops, licenses, manufactures, markets and distributes generic, branded generic and specialty pharmaceuticals.

Upjohn, based in China, is a business division of the global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which operates Pfizer’s off-patent branded and generic established medicines business, including products sold under the brands Viagra, Xanax and Lipitor.

Merger control rules and procedures

The transaction was notified to the Commission on 28 February 2020.

The Commission has the duty to assess mergers and acquisitions involving companies with a turnover above certain thresholds (see Article 1 of the EU Merger Regulation) and to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition in the EEA or any substantial part of it.

The vast majority of notified mergers do not pose competition problems and are cleared after a routine review. From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has a total of 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval or to start an in-depth investigation. This deadline is extended to 35 working days in cases where remedies are submitted by the parties, such as in this case.

More information will be available on the Commission’s competition website, in the Commission’s public case register under the case number M.9517.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/viatris.jpg,Pharma,Mylan|Pfizer|Upjohn ,,Pharma|approves|conditions|european commission|merger,publish,23-4-2020,2,,,,,,,,,,,,

<h3><b><i>Trial will assess the potential of Farxiga in reducing the risk of serious complications and organ failure
</i></b></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca and Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute have initiated a randomised, global Phase III trial to assess the potential of <i>Farxiga </i>(dapagliflozin) as a treatment in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who are at risk of developing serious complications, such as organ failure.

The goal of the trial, called DARE-19, is to assess whether <i>Farxiga</i>, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, can reduce the risk of disease progression, clinical complications, and death due to COVID-19 in patients who also have cardiovascular (CV), metabolic or kidney risk factors.

Cardiac, renal and metabolic comorbidities have been associated with poor outcomes and death in COVID-19 patients. The trial design is supported by extensive data on the protective effect of <i>Farxiga</i> in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), chronic kidney disease (CKD)<sup> </sup>or type 2 diabetes (T2D).<sup>1-5</sup>

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “AstraZeneca is committed to finding new solutions to fight COVID-19 by investigating the application of our new and existing medicines. With the Phase III DARE-19 trial, we aim to test whether <i>Farxiga</i> can prevent serious complications such as organ failure in those patients with pre-existing health conditions, a critical goal when treating COVID-19.”

Mikhail N. Kosiborod, M.D., cardiologist at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Vice President of Research at Saint Luke's Health System, and principal investigator of DARE-19 said: “Dapagliflozin<i> </i>has demonstrated cardio and renal protective benefits and improved outcomes in high-risk patients with type-2 diabetes, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and chronic kidney disease. Patients with COVID-19 and underlying cardiometabolic disease appear to be at the highest risk of morbid complications. Through DARE-19, we hope to decrease the severity of illness, and prevent cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney decompensation, which are common in patients with COVID-19.”

The DARE-19 trial is open for enrolment in the US and other European countries with a high COVID-19 burden and aims to recruit approximately 900 patients.

<b>DARE-19</b>

DARE-19 is an international, parallel-group, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-sponsored Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of <i>Farxiga </i>in addition to background local standard of care therapy, on the risk of all-cause death or disease progression and complications in adults who are hospitalised with COVID-19 at the time of trial enrolment. Patients enrolled in DARE-19 also have a medical history of hypertension (HTN), atherosclerotic CV disease, heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction, T2D or CKD Stage III to IV. The primary efficacy outcome of the trial is time to first occurrence of death from any cause or new/worsened organ dysfunction through 30 days of follow-up.

Some of the patients at highest risk of COVID-19 complications appear to be those with cardiometabolic disease.<sup> 6,7,8</sup> CV complications, including acute myocardial injury and heart failure (HF) are common in COVID-19, and appear to be key drivers of poor outcomes and death especially in patients with pre-existing CV disease and/or CKD.<sup> 9,10</sup>

<b>COVID-19 and AstraZeneca Research</b>

AstraZeneca is rapidly mobilising its COVID-19 research efforts to focus on key areas: identifying novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to prevent or treat disease progression; and investigating the application of our new and existing medicines to suppress the body’s overactive immune response, or protect from serious complications, such as organ failure caused by COVID-19 disease.

<b><i>Farxiga</i></b>

<i>Farxiga</i> is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction. In the DECLARE CV outcomes trial in adults with T2D, <i>Farxiga</i> reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of hospitalisation for HF or CV death versus placebo, when added to standard of care.

The process for obtaining emergency use authorization is now ongoing in Sweden, UK and France.

The <a href=""https://mobidiag.com/products/coronavirus-1/#Amplidiag-COVID-19"">Novodiag<sup>®</sup> COVID-19</a> assay allows qualitative determination of SARS-CoV-2 (orf1ab and N genes) directly from nasopharyngeal swabs. The test will operate using the <a href=""https://mobidiag.com/products/novodiag/"">Novodiag<sup>®</sup></a> rapid ‘sample-in, result-out’ system, allowing the fully automated detection of novel coronavirus in approximately 1 hour. In addition, Novodiag<sup>®</sup> has a closed system which ensures the protection of laboratory staff and healthcare professionals from possible contamination. The user-friendly nature of the system means that the Novodiag<sup>®</sup> system can also be used in high risk and hard to reach areas without the need for highly trained personnel.

This new test complements the emergency use test, <a href=""https://mobidiag.com/products/coronavirus-1/#Amplidiag-COVID-19"">Amplidiag<sup>®</sup> COVID-19</a>*, which is suitable for high-throughput screening, <a href=""https://mobidiag.com/2020/04/14/amplidiag-covid-19-molecular-diagnostic-test-granted-emergency-use-authorization-in-finland-for-novel-coronavirus/"">launched on 14 April 2020</a>. This test is now available in Finland and routinely used in the main Finnish clinical laboratories as well as in France where it has been validated by the National Center of Reference – Institut Pasteur.

Due to the high demand for diagnostic devices and tests globally, Mobidiag has ensured that its supply chain and manufacturing capabilities are robust and able to support its customers. This includes for example the sourcing and acquisition of various consumables to cover the complete workflow from sample collection to the results (e.g. inhouse production of enzymes, the development of our proprietary mNAT™ sample buffer and collection tubes).

<strong>Tuomas Tenkanen, CEO of Mobidiag, said,</strong> “The coronavirus pandemic is a global challenge that needs all parts of industry to respond with innovative solutions for multiple settings. Early detection of COVID-19 infections is critical in supporting clinical decisions to efficiently manage epidemiological and infection control measures to isolate patients in a timely manner and to globally improve patient care. At Mobidiag, we have harnessed our existing technologies and expertise, including supply chain management and manufacturing, to rapidly develop and supply two coronavirus diagnostics tests, providing clinicians solutions suited to their own laboratory capacities.

<span class=""xn-location"">DUBLIN</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">April 23, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/theravance-biopharma-announces-first-subject-dosed-in-phase-1-study-of-td-0903-in-development-for-the-treatment-of-hospitalized-patients-with-acute-lung-injury-caused-by-covid-19-301045864.html#financial-modal"">TBPH</a>) (""Theravance Biopharma"" or the ""Company""), a diversified biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of organ-selective medicines, today announced that the first healthy volunteer has been dosed in a Phase 1 study of TD-0903. TD-0903 is a lung-selective, nebulized Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) in development for the potential treatment of hospitalized patients with Acute Lung Injury (ALI) caused by COVID-19.  The Company believes TD-0903 has the potential to inhibit the cytokine storm associated with ALI and prevent progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

Theravance Biopharma received approval of TD-0903's initial Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in the <span class=""xn-location"">United Kingdom</span> (UK) for the Phase 1 study. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single- and multiple-ascending doses (SAD/MAD) of TD-0903 in healthy volunteers and will enroll up to 54 volunteers. More information can be found on clinicaltrials.gov, identifier number: NCT04350736. Upon regulatory review and approval, the program will then initially move to a nested Phase 2 study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the same clinical setting in the UK.

""Theravance Biopharma's efforts to address COVID-19 leverage years of experience in developing lung-selective medicines to treat respiratory disease. We are pleased to have received expedited approval of TD-0903's CTA and are working to progress this potential treatment option through clinical trials as quickly as possible,"" said Rick E Winningham, Chief Executive Officer. ""The clinical site that we are working with has a long history of evaluating our inhaled medicines, and we are proud to be working with them to advance TD-0903 into clinical testing.""

""There is accumulating evidence that a subgroup of patients with COVID-19 develop a dysfunctional immune response resulting in a cytokine storm within the lungs. JAK inhibition could be an important intervention to treat this hyperinflammation,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Brett Haumann</span>, M.D., Chief Medical Officer. ""TD-0903 has been shown in preclinical studies to have broad pan-JAK inhibition, reducing the signaling of multiple cytokines that have been associated with cytokine storm syndrome. Additionally, the nebulized formulation and organ-selective properties of TD-0903 have the potential to address hyperinflammation in the lung without suppressing the systemic immune system, leading to potential patient benefit and improved utilization of limited hospital critical care resources.""

<b><i>About TD-0903</i></b>

TD-0903 is a lung-selective, nebulized pan-JAK inhibitor that was discovered and developed at Theravance Biopharma. TD-0903 has been shown in experimental murine models to have potent, broad inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling in the airways following challenges with multiple cytokines. By its mechanism, TD-0903 has the potential to block release of cytokines and chemokines that may be associated with acute lung injury and the initiation of a cytokine storm syndrome. Preclinical studies suggest that TD-0903 has a very high lung:plasma ratio and rapid metabolic clearance resulting in low systemic exposure, compatible with its lung selectivity. TD-0903 is administered via nebulized inhalation solution, which further enhances its lung selectivity. Preclinical pharmacodynamic studies indicate that TD-0903 has an extended duration of action that should enable once or twice daily dosing in humans.

As disclosed initially at Theravance Biopharma's <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2018</span> Research and Development Day, the Company indicated the initial clinical application of TD-0903 would be to explore its utility in preventing/delaying graft rejection among individuals receiving lung transplantation. Although this is still a potential clinical application for TD-0903, in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has prioritized activities toward assessing the potential for TD-0903 to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients who become short of breath and whose blood oxygen levels begin to drop. These patients appear to be at increased risk of respiratory complications including ALI and ARDS. They may also require prolonged hospitalization, continuous oxygen and, in the most severe cases, admission to ICU to assist their breathing with non-invasive and/or mechanical ventilation. Treatment with JAK inhibition is recognized as an important anti-inflammatory mechanism to potentially reduce the hyperinflammation seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who develop ALI and ARDS.<sup>1</sup>

Following the completion of the Phase 1 study, Phase 2 will consist of two parts. The first part will assess the safety, tolerability and clinical response to treatment in sequential ascending dose cohorts of COVID-19 patients in the UK. This part of the study will not be formally powered for efficacy but will inform the selection of dose(s) for the second part. The second part of the Phase 2 study will be a larger, multi-center study conducted at hospital-based clinical sites in the UK, and potentially other clinical sites in the European Union and United States. Both of the latter territories would join the Phase 2 study program following review and approval of the relevant regulatory filings required by the relevant EU National Competent Authorities and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Further details on the program, including more on the Phase 2 study will be provided once these studies have been approved by the appropriate regulatory and ethics review authorities.

<b><i>About the Inhaled JAK Inhibitor Program</i></b>

JAK inhibitors function by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. Inhibiting these JAK enzymes interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Limiting JAK inhibition to the lung is expected to improve therapeutic index relative to systemic inhibition. Thus, inhaled JAK inhibitors with lung-restricted exposure are of high interest as potential treatments for respiratory illness.

TD-8236 is the Company's most advanced investigational pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor currently designed for delivery to the lungs using a dry powder inhaler (DPI). Similar to TD-0903, TD-8236 is a lung-selective agent designed to inhibit the JAK family of enzymes in lung tissue with limited systemic exposure. An extensive set of preclinical pharmacological studies and toxicological studies support its current clinical development in the primary indication of moderate to severe asthma. Insights from the ongoing clinical development of TD-8236 DPI are informing the Company's confidence to bring TD-0903 forward for the treatment of COVID-19 acute lung injury.

In addition, Theravance Biopharma is currently assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations, including on the commercial operations associated with YUPELRI® (revefenacin inhalation solution) and on the conduct of its clinical development programs for TD-1473, ampreloxetine and TD-8236. The situation continues to evolve as the pandemic's effects are felt around the world. The Company has implemented a comprehensive business continuity plan to support its performance, and it remains well capitalized to advance the company despite the obstacles presented by the current environment. The Company will provide further program updates during its Q1 financial results and business update call in early <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2020</span>.

<h1 class=""single-entry-title entry-title"">&nbsp;</h1>","NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., April 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Johnson & Johnson (the Company) (NYSE: JNJ) today announced a collaboration between the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. to support the manufacturing of its lead investigational COVID-19 vaccine candidate. This is the first in a series of prospective global collaboration agreements designed to accelerate manufacturing of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and further the Company’s goal to supply more than one billion doses of the vaccine globally.

Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, said, “We have set a high bar. Johnson & Johnson has committed to rapidly produce and supply more than one billion doses of a safe and effective vaccine globally. Our collaboration with Emergent is proof that we are moving quickly to deliver on that promise.”

Under the terms of this manufacturing agreement, Johnson & Johnson is investing to expand drug substance capacity related to the vaccine candidate. Emergent will provide drug substance manufacturing services with its molecule-to-market CDMO offering, beginning in 2020, and will also reserve operations capacity to potentially support commercial manufacturing of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate leveraging Janssen’s proven AdVac® and PER.C6®technologies beginning in 2021.

The Company has already begun preparations for clinical vaccine production at its facility in Leiden, the Netherlands, with the aim of initiating Phase 1 human clinical studies of its vaccine candidate in September 2020. Johnson & Johnson will begin production at risk and is committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use.

Simultaneously, Johnson & Johnson is also aiming to rapidly scale up vaccine manufacturing capabilities globally, including increasing capacity in countries outside the U.S. The additional global capacity will assist in the rapid production of a vaccine and enable the supply of more than one billion doses of a safe and effective vaccine to people around the world.

For more than 20 years, Johnson & Johnson has invested billions of dollars in antivirals and vaccine capabilities. The COVID-19 vaccine program leverages Janssen’s proven AdVac® and PER.C6® technologies that provide the ability to rapidly develop new vaccine candidates and upscale production of the optimal vaccine candidate. The same technology was used to develop and manufacture the Company’s investigational Ebola vaccine and construct our RSV and HIV vaccine candidates which are in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical development stages.

COVID-19 belongs to a group of viruses called coronaviruses that attack the respiratory system. There is currently no approved vaccine, treatment or cure for COVID-19.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Additional sBLAs Filed Across All Approved Adult Indications</b></p>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the resubmission of its supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLAs) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to update the dosing frequency for KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, to include a 400 mg dose infused over 30 minutes every six weeks (Q6W), in addition to the currently approved dose of 200 mg every three weeks (Q3W). sBLAs were filed across all adult indications for KEYTRUDA, including monotherapy and combination therapy. Merck has filed the resubmissions to address the Complete Response Letter issued in February 2020.

“The oncology community is rapidly adapting cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to minimize exposure and keep cancer patients as safe as possible. Now more than ever, we believe it is critical to pursue a six-week dosing schedule for KEYTRUDA,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We appreciate FDA’s guidance during the resubmission period and look forward to working closely with the agency as they continue their review.”

<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg
</strong>KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefiting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)
</b><i>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
</i>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib
</i>KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
</b>Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
</b>Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
</b>Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
</b>In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

<b>Embryofetal Toxicity
</b>Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced further positive results from the Phase III PROfound trial of <i>Lynparza</i> (olaparib) in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have a homologous recombination repair gene mutation (HRRm) and have progressed on prior treatment with new hormonal agent (NHA) treatments (e.g. enzalutamide and abiraterone).

Results from the trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the key secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) with <i>Lynparza</i> versus enzalutamide or abiraterone in men with mCRPC selected for BRCA1/2 or ATM gene mutations, a subpopulation of HRR gene mutations.

The Phase III PROfound trial had met its primary endpoint in <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/lynparza-phase-iii-profound-trial-in-hrr-mutation-selected-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-met-primary-endpoint-07082019.html"">August 2019</a>, showing significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in men with mutations in BRCA1/2 or ATM genes, and had met a key secondary endpoint of rPFS in the overall HRRm population.

Jose´ Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “<a name=""_Hlk38445291""></a>Overall survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has remained extremely challenging to achieve. We are thrilled by these results for <i>Lynparza</i> and we are working with regulatory authorities to bring this medicine to patients as soon as possible.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “<i>Lynparza</i> has demonstrated significant clinical benefit across key endpoints in PROfound, including overall survival for patients with BRCA or ATM mutations, and this reinforces its potential to change the treatment standard for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. These data further support MSD and AstraZeneca’s commitment to uncovering the ways in which <i>Lynparza </i>can help patients impacted by cancer.”

The safety and tolerability profile of <i>Lynparza </i>was generally consistent with previous trials. The data will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

<i>Lynparza </i>was granted Priority Review in the US for patients with HRRm mCRPC in <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/lynparza-regulatory-submission-granted-priority-review-in-the-us-for-hrr-mutated-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-20012020.html"">January 2020</a>, with regulatory reviews ongoing in the EU and other jurisdictions. AstraZeneca and MSD are exploring additional trials in prostate cancer including the ongoing Phase III PROpel trial, with first data expected in 2021, testing <i>Lynparza </i>as a 1st-line medicine for patients with mCRPC in combination with abiraterone acetate versus abiraterone acetate alone.

<b>Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer</b>

Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer in men, with an estimated 1.3 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2018, and is associated with a significant mortality rate.<sup>1</sup> Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone.<sup>2</sup> In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones.<sup>2</sup> Approximately 10-20% of men with advanced prostate cancer will develop CRPC within five years, and at least 84% of these men will have metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis.<sup>3</sup> Of men with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.<sup>3</sup> Despite advances in treatment for men with mCRPC, five-year survival is low and extending survival remains a key goal for treating these men.<sup>3</sup>

<b>HRR gene mutations</b>

HRR mutations occur in approximately 20-30% of patients with mCRPC.<sup>4</sup> HRR genes allow for accurate repair of damaged DNA in normal cells.<sup>5,6 </sup>HRR deficiency (HRD) means the DNA damage cannot be repaired, and can result in normal cell death.<sup>6 </sup>This is different in cancer cells, where a mutation in HRR pathways leads to abnormal cell growth and therefore

cancer.<sup>6 </sup>HRD is a well-documented target for PARP inhibitors, such as <i>Lynparza</i>. PARP inhibitors block a rescue DNA damage repair mechanism by trapping PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks which leads to replication fork stalling causing their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks, which in turn lead to cancer cell death.<sup>6 </sup>

<b>PROfound</b>

PROfound is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase III trial testing the efficacy and safety of <i>Lynparza</i>versus enzalutamide or abiraterone in patients with mCRPC who have progressed on prior treatment with NHA treatments (abiraterone or enzalutamide) and have a qualifying tumour mutation in BRCA1/2, ATM or one of 12 other genes involved in the HRR pathway.

The trial was designed to analyse patients with HRRm genes in two cohorts: the primary endpoint was rPFS in those with mutations in BRCA1/2 or ATM genes and then, if <i>Lynparza</i> showed clinical benefit, a formal analysis was performed of the overall trial population of patients with HRRm genes (BRCA1/2, ATM, CDK12 and 11 other HRRm genes; a key secondary endpoint).

<b><i>Lynparza</i></b>

<i>Lynparza</i> (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair, such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with <i>Lynparza</i> leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. <i>Lynparza</i> is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.

<i>Lynparza</i> is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. <i>Lynparza</i> is approved in the US and several other countries for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in several jurisdictions for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

<i>Lynparza</i>, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. <i>Lynparza</i> has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. <i>Lynparza</i> is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.<b></b>

<b>The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration </b>

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise <i>Lynparza</i>, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and <i>Koselugo</i> (selumetinib)<i>,</i> a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and <i>Koselugo </i>in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and <i>Koselugo </i>in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

<em><strong>- Portfolio includes select OTC and prescription products and two manufacturing facilities
- Transaction further accelerates Company’s deleveraging plan</strong></em>

</div>
<div class=""mainBody"">

<strong>Osaka, JAPAN, April 24, 2020 –</strong> Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (<a href=""https://www.takeda.com/investors/"">TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK</a>) (“Takeda”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to divest a portfolio of select non-core over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription pharmaceutical products sold in Europe, and two manufacturing sites located in Denmark and Poland to Orifarm Group (“Orifarm”), a fast-growing Danish pharmaceutical company, for up to approximately $670 million USD subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions.

The portfolio to be divested to Orifarm includes a variety of OTC products and food supplements as well as select prescription products in the Respiratory, Anti-inflammatory, Cardiovascular and Endocrinology therapeutic areas sold predominantly in Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Poland, Finland, Sweden, the Baltics and Austria. The portfolio generated FY 2018 net sales of approximately $230 million USD, driven by strong sales of cough/cold and vitamin OTC brands, as well as prescription products Warfarin and Levaxin. While the products included in the sale address key patient needs in these countries, they are outside of Takeda’s chosen business areas – Gastroenterology (GI), Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology, and Neuroscience – core to its global long-term growth strategy.

“These divestments will enable us to further prioritize and reinforce efforts in our core business areas” said Giles Platford, President, Europe &amp; Canada Business Unit, Takeda. “Throughout the robust sale process we conducted for these assets, we focused on finding the right partner to maximize the value of these trusted products and maintain continuity of supply for the patients and customers who depend on them. We are confident that Orifarm is the right partner for these regions.”

“This transaction represents the continued execution of our strategy to simplify our portfolio and accelerate deleveraging. We remain focused on investing in our key business areas as we continue strengthening our position as a R&amp;D-driven global biopharmaceutical leader and deliver enhanced value for patients and Takeda shareholders,” said Costa Saroukos, Chief Financial Officer, Takeda.

Takeda has announced a series of divestments in the past twelve months, contributing to the Company’s goal to divest approximately $10 billion USD in non-core assets and focus on its key business areas. Takeda announced last month the sale of non-core products in Latin America to Hypera Pharma for $825 million USD. Takeda also completed sales of non-core assets spanning the Russia-CIS region to STADA for $660 million USD and in countries spanning the Near East, Middle East and Africa region to Acino for over $200 million USD last month. In July 2019, Takeda completed the sale of Xiidra® to Novartis for up to $5.3 billion USD.

Takeda intends to use the proceeds from its divestitures to continue to reduce its debt towards its target of 2x net debt/adjusted EBITDA within March 2022 – March 2024.

<strong>Transaction Details
</strong>Takeda has entered into an agreement to sell a portfolio of approximately 110 select OTC and prescription pharmaceutical assets sold in Europe to Orifarm for a total value of up to approximately $670 million USD subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions. Orifarm will pay approximately $505 million USD to Takeda in cash at closing, and approximately $70 million USD in non-contingent cash to be paid within four years post-closing. In addition, Takeda may receive up to an additional $95 million USD in potential milestone payments.

Two manufacturing sites in Denmark and Poland will also be transferred to Orifarm at closing. The parties will also enter into additional manufacturing and supply agreements, under which Takeda will continue to manufacture selected products on behalf of Orifarm. Under the terms of the agreement, Orifarm will acquire the rights, title and interest to the products in the portfolio exclusive to these countries.

It is anticipated that approximately 600 employees from the manufacturing sites, sales and marketing professionals, and other select professionals supporting the portfolio and manufacturing sites to be divested will transition to Orifarm at closing of the transaction.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of Fiscal Year 2020 (ending March 2021) subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, receipt of required regulatory clearances and, where applicable, compliance with local works council requirements. Until then, the products will continue to be made available to patients and manufactured and supplied by Takeda.

Takeda is being advised by J.P. Morgan as our financial advisor and White &amp; Case is our legal advisor in this transaction.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Latest innovation in quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination designed for use in persons 2 years of age and older in the U.S.
Safety and effectiveness studied in five double-blind, randomized clinical trials with nearly 5,000 individuals
Helps protect an expanded age group and elicits a high immune response across multiple ages
Under regulatory review in Europe and other countries to help support local immunization efforts
 

PARIS – April 24, 2020 – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a Biologics License Application for MenQuadfiTM Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y, W) Conjugate Vaccine for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease in persons 2 years of age and older.

“Meningococcal meningitis remains a major global health challenge because it can strike quickly and with devastating effect, taking a life in less than 24 hours. With the ability to help prevent this disease through vaccination, Sanofi believes one case is one too many,” said David Loew, Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur. “Approval of this new vaccine in the U.S. represents an important milestone in the ongoing fight to help protect as many people as possible from meningococcal disease. It is our ambition to make this vaccine available to further expand protection to individuals worldwide.”

MenQuadfi is Sanofi’s Latest MenACWY Innovation

MenQuadfi was designed to elicit and demonstrated a high immune response across all four serogroups for multiple ages and was well tolerated. MenQuadfi is intended to protect an expanded age group. Licensure marks MenQuadfi as the only U.S. FDA-approved quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine indicated for persons 2 through 56 years of age and older.1 MenQuadfi is the first and only quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine in the U.S. that uses tetanus toxoid as a protein carrier. It will be available in a ready-to-use liquid formulation allowing healthcare providers to avoid vaccine reconstitution.

The ongoing Phase 3 trials are investigating use in infants as young as 6 weeks of age to better address the worldwide needs for meningococcal disease prevention throughout life.

“Given the severity and unpredictability of meningococcal disease, there is a public health need to ensure immunization across multiple ages, consistent with U.S. recommendations,” said Corey Robertson, MD, Senior Director, Scientific and Medical Affairs at Sanofi Pasteur. “MenQuadfi’s pivotal clinical trials demonstrated a high immune response across all four serogroups and provides a new vaccine option to help protect an expanded age group.”

MenQuadfi’s FDA approval is based on a robust clinical program

The FDA approval is based on clinical data from five double-blind, randomized, multicenter Phase 2 and 3 trials that assessed safety and immune responses following vaccination, with nearly 5,000 persons 2 years of age and older. Based on study objectives, immune responses elicited by MenQuadfi achieved non-inferiority compared to those induced by licensed quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. Four studies evaluated MenQuadfi in meningococcal-naïve persons; the other study evaluated MenQuadfi in persons previously immunized with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. Against each of the four meningococcal serogroups (A, C, W, Y), the majority (55.4%–97.2%) of meningococcal-naïve trial participants had a vaccine-induced immune response 30 days following vaccination with MenQuadfi. Among adolescents and adults previously vaccinated, 92.2%–98.2% demonstrated an immune response against each serogroup.

The most common side effects following a first dose of MenQuadfi included injection site pain (25.5%–45.2%), muscle ache (20.1%–35.6%), headache (12.5%–30.2%), and tiredness (14.5%–26.0%). In adolescents and adults receiving a MenQuadfi booster, similar rates of these reactions were observed.

Pivotal study results demonstrating MenQuadfi’s safety and effectiveness in inducing an immune response across all four serogroups have been published, including the performance of MenQuadfi in adolescents when the vaccine was co-administered with other routinely recommended vaccines,2 and its performance as a booster.3 Additional data were presented at the 2019 European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases Annual Meeting and IDWeek 2019.

MenQuadfi is expected to be available to providers and pharmacies nationwide in the U.S. for immunization efforts in 2021.

Sanofi’s legacy includes more than 45 years at the forefront of meningococcal disease prevention

MenQuadfi builds on Sanofi’s legacy at the forefront of meningococcal disease prevention beginning with the first monovalent vaccine for Africa in 1974. Since then, Sanofi has worked to progressively extend protection against four of the most prevalent meningococcal disease serogroups with the first quadrivalent vaccine registered in the U.S. in 1981, followed by the first quadrivalent conjugate vaccine licensed in 2005.4

Meningococcal Disease is a Public Health Concern

In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends vaccination against meningococcal disease at 11-12 years of age and a second dose at 16 years of age.5 Despite strong public health recommendations, about half of teens have not received the recommended second dose of MenACWY vaccine by 17 years of age, leaving them vulnerable when they are at increased risk for the disease.6 Hundreds of cases of vaccine-preventable meningococcal disease (caused by serogroups B, C, W, Y) still occur annually in the U.S. and, despite treatment, one in five survivors suffer from permanent complications such as hearing loss, organ damage, and limb amputations.7

Around the world, meningococcal disease is highly unpredictable, and it varies widely across regions and ages. Accordingly, vaccination recommendations differ from country to country. Disease still occurs in unvaccinated individuals. MenQuadfi’s safety and effectiveness data are currently under review though not yet fully evaluated by other health authorities, including those in several other countries and the European Union, to help address their local vaccination recommendations.

  What is MenQuadfi?

MenQuadfi is a vaccine given to people 2 years of age and older to help prevent invasive meningococcal disease (including meningitis) caused by serogroups A, C, W, and Y of the bacterium N meningitidis. MenQuadfi does not prevent serogroup B disease.

Important Safety Information for MenQuadfi in the U.S.

MenQuadfi should not be given to people who have had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of MenQuadfi, any of its ingredients, or another vaccine that contains tetanus toxoid.

If MenQuadfi is given to people with a compromised immune system, including those receiving therapies that suppress the immune system, the immune response may be lower than expected. People with certain complement deficiencies and people taking certain complement inhibitors (for example, eculizumab) may still be at risk for meningococcal disease even if they receive a meningococcal vaccine, including MenQuadfi.

Fainting can occur shortly before or after injecting vaccines, including MenQuadfi.

Tell your health care provider if you ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome (severe muscle weakness) after a previous meningococcal vaccination.

Vaccination with MenQuadfi may not protect all people who receive the vaccine.

The most common side effects after a first dose of MenQuadfi for people 2 years and older include pain where the shot is given; muscle aches, headache, and tiredness. In children 2 through 9 years of age, other common side effects include redness and swelling where the shot is given. In adolescents and adults receiving a booster dose of MenQuadfi, the most common side effects include those occurring after a first dose. Other side effects may occur.

Pratteln, Switzerland, April 27, 2020 – Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) has entered into a collaboration agreement with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) to investigate the potential of lonodelestat (POL6014), a potent inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase (hNE), as a therapeutic intervention for COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Researchers at CSHL are part of a recently formed consortium of international non-clinical and clinical experts called the ‘NETwork to target neutrophils in COVID-19’. This NETwork will study the role of neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the pathology of COVID-19 as well as hNE and other targets for intervention for the purpose of treating COVID-19 [1, 2].</p>
<p align=""justify"">NETs are macromolecular structures of DNA and proteins that neutrophils can expel, for example during severe inflammation. hNE is released by neutrophils when they form NETs. There are clear similarities between the clinical presentation of severe COVID-19 and diseases known to involve NETs, such as ARDS. On this basis, the NETwork has developed the rationale that excess NETs may play a major role in COVID-19 and that inhibition of hNE may be a therapeutic strategy to antagonize NETs in COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Santhera will provide lonodelestat and intellectual support for the scientists at CSHL who will conduct the non-clinical research program. The work is expected to further validate hNE as a target and shed light on this clinical stage compound as a potential agent also in COVID-19.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“There is a strong scientific rationale that inhibition of hNE may interrupt a neutrophil-driven inflammatory cascade that leads to ARDS in COVID-19 patients” explained<strong> Mikala Egeblad, PhD, Associate Professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York</strong>. “Based on previous work with lonodelestat in models of ARDS and acute lung injury, we were very encouraged about the potential of lonodelestat. Our own research in non-clinical models will start immediately and we are delighted that Santhera has offered their support in our efforts to find a potential novel treatment that could be investigated in patients with COVID-19.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We would like to thank CSHL and collaborating clinicians that have approached us to support their efforts to further explore and understand the role of hNE in relation to ARDS in COVID-19,” said <strong>Kristina Sjöblom Nygren, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Development of Santhera</strong>.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About lonodolestat (POL6014)</strong>
Lonodelestat (previously known as POL6014) is a highly potent and selective peptide inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase (hNE). In preclinical studies lonodelestat was effective in animal models of neutrophil activation in lung tissue and of acute lung injury (ALI) [3, 4]. Lonodelestat is an investigational drug which completed Phase 1 single dose escalation studies in healthy volunteers and patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is currently investigated in a multiple ascending dose study in CF patients. Current data demonstrated that single dose inhalation of lonodelestat can lead to high drug concentrations within the lung, resulting in inhibition of hNE in sputum of patients, an enzyme associated with lung tissue inflammation [5].</p>

<p align=""justify""><strong>About human neutrophil elastase (hNE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19</strong>
Activated or necrotic neutrophils liberate human neutrophil elastase (hNE) in the lung which causes damage to the pulmonary microenvironment. hNE is also a critical enzyme in neutrophils and it is required for neutrophils to form NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps) as part of the body’s immune response. Under conditions of severe inflammation, neutrophils can expel NETs which can aggravate pulmonary inflammation and may contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Inhibition of hNE activity may therefore display a dual action: it may block the toxicity of hNE in the lung tissue, prevent the formation of NETs and therefore may allow combating ARDS in patients with COVID-19.</p>

Submissions demonstrate Janssen’s commitment to developing new options
for young patients
HORSHAM, PA, April 24, 2020 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of
Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced the submission of two supplemental Biologics
License Applications (sBLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking
approval of SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and juvenile psoriatic arthritis (jPsA), in patients two years
of age and older in combination with methotrexate. If approved for these indications,
SIMPONI ARIA would be the first anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha biologic
agent administered by intravenous infusion available for the treatment of these
juvenile arthritides.
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a group of disorders characterized by arthritis
Page 2 of 8
persisting for at least six weeks before the age of 16 years.i
Approximately 300,000
children suffer from some form of JIA in the United States.ii The polyarticular form of
JIA is most common and is characterized by inflammation in more than four joints
and resembles adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA).iii Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is
one of the rarest subtypes of JIA and is characterized by both joint inflammation and
skin lesions associated with psoriasis resembling adult PsA.iv,v
“All forms of JIA can be debilitating for children who live with the disease, and their
parents and physicians often have a difficult time establishing a treatment plan given
the limited options currently available for pediatric patients,” said Alyssa Johnsen,
M.D., Ph.D., Vice President and Rheumatology Disease Area Leader, Janssen
Research &amp; Development, LLC. “At Janssen, we are focused on addressing unmet
needs for all patients and are especially pleased to be taking these positive steps that
could make a new treatment option available for these young patients.”
The submissions are based on results from the GO-VIVA Phase 3 clinical trial, which
was an open-label study conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and
efficacy of SIMPONI ARIA in children with pJIA ages two to 17 years who had active
arthritis in five or more joints, despite receiving treatment with methotrexate for at
least two months. The trial also included patients with jPsA.
GO-VIVA was designed to extrapolate data from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical
development program for SIMPONI ARIA. Data extrapolation is the process of
estimating future trends or effects based on previous observations. With limited
pediatric patients available for clinical trial inclusion, researchers can extrapolate data
from adult patient trials to determine the potential efficacy and tolerability of a
treatment for the pediatric population.
About the GO-VIVA Clinical Trial
GO-VIVA is a Phase 3, open-label, single arm, multicenter study conducted across
nine countries with treatment received by 127 patients with active pJIA, despite
current treatment with methotrexate. GO-VIVA is included as a post-marketing
requirement under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) following the initial
Page 3 of 8
approval of SIMPONI ARIA for adults with moderately to severely active RA in 2013.
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics safety and efficacy of
SIMPONI ARIA in pJIA in pediatric patients aged two to 17 years. The
pharmacokinetic and efficacy data in pJIA patients were compared to adult RA
patients from the SIMPONI ARIA Phase 3 GO-FURTHER trial and the
pharmacokinetics and efficacy results in jPsA patients were compared to adult PsA
patients from the Phase 3 GO-VIBRANT trial.
About Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
JIA is a group of disorders characterized by arthritis persisting for at least six weeks
before the age of 16 years.i
Approximately 300,000 children in the U.S. suffer from
some form of JIA.ii

The polyarticular form of JIA causes inflammation in more than four joints and can be
rheumatoid factor-positive or negative, with rheumatoid factor-positive polyarticular
arthritis closely resembling adult RA.iii About 25 percent of children with JIA have the
polyarticular form.vi Polyarticular JIA poses challenges given the number of joints
involved in the condition and the refractory nature of the disease which can increase
the risk of joint damage.vi Weight-bearing joints and the jaw can be affected,
although the disease more commonly affects the small joints of the fingers and
hands.vii

Juvenile PsA is one of the rarest subtypes of JIA with an estimated 2 to 11 percent of
JIA patients affected by the disease.iv,v Juvenile patients experience many of the same
PsA symptoms as adults, including pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the
joints.iii
About SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) infusion
SIMPONI ARIA is the only fully human anti-TNF-alpha therapy administered via a 30-
minute infusion approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely
active RA, active PsA or active AS.
Page 4 of 8
SIMPONI ARIA® is a human anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody that targets
both soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNF-alpha, a
protein that when overproduced in the body due to chronic inflammatory
diseases can cause inflammation. By binding with and blocking TNF-alpha,
SIMPONI ARIA® helps control inflammation. SIMPONI ARIA® is approved as a
30-minute infusion for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to
severely active RA used in combination with methotrexate, active PsA or active
AS. SIMPONI ARIA® is approved in 24 countries, including the U.S.
More information about SIMPONI ARIA® is available at www.SimponiARIA.com.
Janssen Biotech, Inc. discovered and developed SIMPONI ARIA®.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
SERIOUS INFECTIONS
SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) is a prescription medicine. SIMPONI ARIA® can
lower your ability to fight infections. There are reports of serious infections
caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that have spread throughout the body,
including tuberculosis (TB) and histoplasmosis. Some of these infections
have been fatal. Your doctor will test you for TB before starting SIMPONI
ARIA® and will closely monitor you for signs of TB during treatment. Tell
your doctor if you have been in close contact with people with TB. Tell your
doctor if you have been in a region (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River
Valleys and the Southwest) where certain fungal infections like
histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis are common.
You should not receive SIMPONI ARIA® if you have any kind of infection. Tell your
doctor if you are prone to or have a history of infections or have diabetes, HIV or a
weak immune system. You should also tell your doctor if you are currently being
treated for an infection or if you have or develop any signs of an infection such as:
• fever, sweat, or chills
• muscle aches
• warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body
• diarrhea or stomach pain
• cough
• shortness of breath
• blood in phlegm
• weight loss
• burning when you urinate or urinate more than normal
• feel very tired
Page 5 of 8
Your doctor will examine you for TB and perform a test to see if you have TB. If your
doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated with medicine for TB
before you begin treatment with SIMPONI ARIA® and during treatment with SIMPONI
ARIA®. Even if your TB testis negative, your doctor should carefully monitor you for
TB infections while you are taking SIMPONI ARIA®. People who had a negative TB skin
test before receiving SIMPONI ARIA® have developed active TB. Tell your doctor if you
have any of the following symptoms while taking or after taking SIMPONI ARIA®:
• cough that does not go away
• low grade fever
• weight loss
• loss of body fat and muscle (wasting)
CANCER
Unusual cancers have been reported in children and teenage patients taking
Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blocker medicines. For children and adults
receiving TNF blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA®, the chances for getting lymphoma
or other cancers may increase. Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, a rare and fatal
lymphoma, has occurred mostly in teenage or young adult males with Crohn’s disease
or ulcerative colitis who were taking a TNF blocker with azathioprine or 6-
mercaptopurine. You should tell your doctor if you have had or develop lymphoma or
other cancers.
Some people treated with SIMPONI ARIA® developed skin cancer. Tell your doctor if
any changes in the appearance of your skin or growths on your skin occur during or
after your treatment with SIMPONI ARIA®. Your doctor should periodically examine
your skin, especially if you have a history of skin cancer.
USE WITH OTHER DRUGS
Tell your doctor about all the medications you take including ORENCIA® (abatacept),
KINERET® (anakinra), ACTEMRA® (tocilizumab), RITUXAN® (rituximab), or another
TNF blocker, or if you are scheduled to or recently received a vaccine. People
receiving SIMPONI ARIA® should not receive live vaccines or treatment with a
weakened bacteria (such as BCG for bladder cancer).
HEPATITIS B INFECTION
Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has been reported in patients who are carriers of this
virus and are receiving TNF-blocker medicines, such as SIMPONI ARIA®. Some of
these cases have been fatal. Your doctor should do blood tests before and after you
start treatment with SIMPONI ARIA®. Tell your doctor if you know or think you may
be a carrier of hepatitis B virus or if you experience signs of hepatitis B infection, such
as:
• feel very tired
• dark urine
• skin or eyes look yellow
• little or no appetite
• vomiting
• muscle aches
Page 6 of 8
• clay-colored bowel movements
• fever
• chills
• stomach discomfort
• skin rash
HEART FAILURE
Heart failure can occur or get worse in people who use TNF blockers, including
SIMPONI ARIA®. If you develop new or worsening heart failure with SIMPONI ARIA®,
you may need treatment in a hospital, and it may result in death. Your doctor will
closely monitor you if you have heart failure. Tell your doctor right away if you get
new or worsening symptoms of heart failure like shortness of breath, swelling of your
lower legs or feet, or sudden weight gain.
NERVOUS SYSTEM PROBLEMS
Rarely, people using TNF blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA®, can have nervous
system problems such as multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Tell your
doctor right away if you have symptoms like vision changes, weakness in your arms
or legs, or numbness or tingling in any part of your body.
IMMUNE SYSTEM PROBLEMS
Rarely, people using TNF blockers have developed lupus-like symptoms. Tell your
doctor if you have any symptoms such as a rash on your cheeks or other parts of the
body, sensitivity to the sun, new joint or muscle pain, becoming very tired, chest pain
or shortness of breath, swelling of the feet, ankles or legs.
LIVER PROBLEMS
Serious liver problems can happen in people using TNF blockers, including SIMPONI
ARIA®. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop symptoms such as feeling
very tired, skin or eyes look yellow, poor appetite or vomiting, or pain on the right
side of your stomach.
BLOOD PROBLEMS
Low blood counts have been seen with people using TNF blockers, including SIMPONI
ARIA®. If this occurs, your body may not make enough blood cells to help fight
infections or help stop bleeding. Your doctor will check your blood counts before and
during treatment. Tell your doctor if you have signs such as fever, bruising, bleeding
easily, or paleness.
ALLERGIC REACTIONS
Allergic reactions can happen in people who use TNF-blocker medicines, including
SIMPONI ARIA®. Tell your doctor if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction
while receiving SIMPONI ARIA® such as hives, swollen face, breathing trouble, or
chest pain. Some reactions can be serious and life-threatening.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS TO TELL YOUR DOCTOR
Tell your doctor if you have psoriasis.
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, are breastfeeding,
or plan to breastfeed, or have a baby and received SIMPONI ARIA® during pregnancy.
Page 7 of 8
Tell your baby’s doctor before your baby receives any vaccine because of an
increased risk of infection for up to 6 months after birth.
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS
The most common side effects of SIMPONI ARIA® include: upper respiratory infection,
abnormal liver tests, decreased blood cells that fight infection, viral infections,
bronchitis, high blood pressure, and rash.
Please read the full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for
SIMPONI ARIA® and discuss any questions you have with your doctor.

? Satralizumab monotherapy significantly reduced risk of relapse in patients with NMOSD, following a previous positive study where satralizumab was added to baseline immunosuppressant therapy. ? The patient population examined in the satralizumab monotherapy study represents a broad, real-world spectrum of adults with NMOSD.

TOKYO, April 24, 2020 -- Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 4519) announced today that the results of the SAkuraStar Study (NCT02073279), a global phase III clinical study of satralizumab (development code: SA237) were published on April, 22 (local time) in The Lancet Neurology. Satralizumab is an anti-IL6 receptor humanized recycling antibody under development for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).

The phase III study examined the efficacy and safety of satralizumab as monotherapy for adults with NMOSD.

“The longer-term efficacy in satralizumab monotherapy study reinforces the important role of IL-6 inhibition in treating NMOSD following the previous combination therapy study,” said Chugai’s President and COO, Dr. Osamu Okuda. “We are collaborating with Roche to obtain global regulatory approval this year so that we can bring satralizumab as a new treatment option to patients as soon as possible.” In the SAkuraStar Study, satralizumab significantly reduced the risk of relapse by 55% (hazard ratio=0.45 [95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.89], p=0.018 [stratified log-rank test]) in the overall population, representative of the broad real-world spectrum of NMOSD patients (including AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative patients), achieving the primary endpoint of time to first protocol-defined relapse in the double-blind period. Importantly, 76.1%, 72.1% and 62.8% of patients on satralizumab were relapse-free at weeks 48, 96 and 144 compared to 61.9%, 51.2% and 34.1 with placebo, respectively. In a prespecified subgroup analysis for time to relapse, hazard ratio of satralizumab to placebo in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients was 0.26 (N=64, 95% confidence interval: 0.11-0.63). The proportion of serious adverse events was similar between the satralizumab and placebo treatment groups. The most common adverse events in the satralizumab group were urinary tract infection and upper respiratory tract infection. 2 / 4 SAkuraStar Study (NCT02073279) Summary: A phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of satralizumab administered to patients with NMOSD Time to first protocol-defined relapse adjudicated by an independent review committee in the doubleblind period Study design: ? 95 male and female patients aged from 20 to 70 years were randomized. ? Patients were randomized to satralizumab or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Satralizumab (120 mg) or placebo was subcutaneously administered at Week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4- week intervals. ? The double-blind treatment period ended when the total number of protocol-defined relapse (PDR) had reached 44 or at 1.5 years after the enrollment of the last patient, whichever occurred first. After experiencing a PDR or completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with satralizumab in an open-label extension period. ? Patients with AQP4-IgG seropositive or seronegative neuromyelitis optica (NMO)* and those with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD were enrolled. *NMO defined in 2006 About neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) NMOSD is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammatory lesions in the optic nerves and spinal cord, and cause continual and significant decrease in quality of life due to permanent neurologic disorders Patients with NMOSD frequently experience a relapsing disease course with repeated attacks leading to accumulating neurological damage and disability.

Symptoms may include visual impairment, motor disability, and loss of quality of life. In some cases, attacks of NMOSD result in death. Aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-IgG), pathogenic antibodies, are detected in at least two-thirds of NMOSD patients. AQP4-IgG is known to target and damage a specific central nervous cell type called astrocytes, resulting in inflammatory demyelinating lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain 1-4 . The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is now emerging as an important factor in NMOSD pathogenesis 5-9 . Diagnostic criteria introduced in 2006 for NMO were characterized by inflammation of the optic nerve (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis). These were revised in 2007 with the definition of NMOSD, proposed for diseases with either optic neuritis or myelitis. In 2015, the definition of NMOSD further revised to include a broader spectrum of disease. The diagnostic term NMOSD is now widely used 10. About satralizumab Satralizumab, created by Chugai, is an anti-IL-6 receptor recycling antibody. The drug is expected to prevent relapse of NMOSD by inhibiting IL-6 signal transduction which is deeply related to the pathology. In two global phase III clinical studies in NMO and NMOSD patients, the primary endpoint was achieved with satralizumab either as an add-on therapy to baseline immunosuppressant treatment (NCT02028884) 3 / 4 or as monotherapy (NCT02073279). T

These studies represent one of the largest clinical trial programs undertaken for this rare disease. Satralizumab is designated as an orphan drug for the treatment of NMO and NMOSD in Japan, and for the treatment of the same disease group in Europe and the U.S. In addition, it has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2018. The regulatory applications were accepted for review by EMA and FDA in 2019. The regulatory application in Japan was filed in 2019. Sources 1. Jarius S, Ruprecht K, Wildemann B et al.

<b>Independent Data Monitoring Committee </b><b>recommended continuing ongoing Phase 3 trial only in the more advanced ""critical"" group with Kevzara higher-dose versus placebo and</b> <b>discontinuing less advanced ""severe"" group</b>

<b>Phase 3 trial will be amended to enroll only ""critical"" patients</b>

<b>Phase 3 trial also be amended to discontinue lower-dose Kevzara (200 mg); all new patients to receive either higher-dose Kevzara (400 mg) or placebo</b>

<b>No new safety findings were observed for Kevzara use in COVID-19 patients</b>

<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2786929-1&amp;h=4119310700&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fregeneron.com%2F&amp;a=Regeneron+Pharmaceuticals%2C+Inc."" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</a> (NASDAQ:<b> REGN</b>) and Sanofi today announced the preliminary results from the Phase 2 portion of an ongoing Phase 2/3 trial evaluating Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody, in hospitalized patients with ""severe"" or ""critical"" respiratory illness caused by COVID-19. Following a review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) of all available Phase 2 and Phase 3 data, the trial will be immediately amended so that only ""critical"" patients continue to be enrolled to receive Kevzara 400 mg or placebo.

The randomized Phase 2 portion of the trial compared intravenously-administered Kevzara higher dose (400 mg), Kevzara lower dose (200 mg) and placebo. It assessed 457 hospitalized patients, who were categorized at baseline as having either ""severe"" illness (28% of patients), ""critical"" illness (49% of patients) or ""multi-system organ dysfunction"" (MSOD) (23% of patients). Patients were classified as ""severe"" if they required oxygen supplementation without mechanical or high-flow oxygenation; or ""critical"" if they required mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygenation or required treatment in an intensive care unit.

Preliminary analysis of the Phase 2 portion of the trial demonstrated that Kevzara rapidly lowered C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of inflammation, meeting the primary endpoint (see table below). Baseline levels of IL-6 were elevated across all treatment arms, with higher levels observed in ""critical"" patients compared to ""severe"" patients. Additionally, no new safety signals were observed with the use of Kevzara in COVID-19 patients.

Analysis of clinical outcomes in the Phase 2 trial was exploratory and pre-specified to focus on the ""severe"" and ""critical"" groups. In the preliminary Phase 2 analysis, Kevzara had no notable benefit on clinical outcomes when combining the ""severe"" and ""critical"" groups, versus placebo. However, there were negative trends for most outcomes in the ""severe"" group, while there were positive trends for all outcomes in the ""critical"" group (see table below). Subsequent to the IDMC review, Regeneron and Sanofi reviewed the discontinued ""severe"" group data, which revealed that the negative trends in the Phase 2 trial (n=126) were not reproduced in Phase 3 trial (n=276), and that clinical outcomes were balanced across the Kevzara and placebo treatment arms. Outcomes for the ""severe"" group were better than expected based on prior reports, regardless of treatment assignment: for example, in the Phase 2 portion, approximately 80% were discharged, 10% of patients died and 10% remain hospitalized.

""Even in a pandemic setting, it's both crucial and possible to obtain controlled data in adequately-sized trials to provide the evidence needed to inform optimal medical care,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Regeneron Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer. ""Emerging evidence with Kevzara and other repurposed drugs in the COVID-19 crisis highlight the challenges of making decisions about existing medicines for new viral threats using small, uncontrolled studies. We await results of the ongoing Phase 3 trial to learn more about COVID-19, and better understand whether some patients may benefit from Kevzara treatment. In addition, there is an acute need for tailored approaches that specifically target this virus. To that end, Regeneron is rapidly advancing our targeted anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail and we plan to initiate clinical trials in June.""

The Kevzara trial was designed after a small (n=21), single-arm study in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> (<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2786929-1&amp;h=4118656827&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chinaxiv.org%2Fabs%2F202003.00026&amp;a=Xu+et+al"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Xu et al</a>) among mostly severe, febrile hospitalized COVID-19 patients found elevated IL-6 levels and suggested that inhibiting this pathway with the IL-6 blocker tocilizumab rapidly reduced fever and improved oxygenation in severe patients, allowing for successful hospital discharge. These uncontrolled findings require confirmation in adequately-sized and well-controlled trials. Last month, Regeneron and Sanofi moved rapidly to evaluate Kevzara in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled adaptively-designed U.S. Phase 2/3 trial in collaboration with U.S. groups including the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA, part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and hospitals across the country.

""At Sanofi, we are committed to help combat the global COVID-19 pandemic. As we quickly follow the science to better understand this disease and explore how to best treat patients, these initial results from the randomized clinical trial setting provide physicians much needed insights and information regarding the potential of Kevzara for patients with COVID-19 treatment,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">John Reed</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Sanofi's Global Head of Research and Development. ""While our evaluation of the use of Kevzara for COVID-19 treatment remains an investigational approach, Sanofi continues to stay at the forefront of multiple initiatives to fight this disease, including researching other potential treatment options, developing vaccine candidates that can be manufactured at large-scale, and a potential collaboration for an innovative SARS-CoV-2 smartphone-based self-testing solution.""

The Phase 2 numerical results are presented in the table below, including exploratory clinical endpoints for the ""critical"" group, which is the focus of the ongoing Phase 3 trial.

<b>1.</b> 7-point scale consists of: 1) death; 2) hospitalized, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) hospitalized, requiring non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen – requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 6) hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen – no longer requires ongoing medical care; 7) discharged from hospital.

The ongoing portion of the Phase 3 trial, which is continuing to enroll, currently includes more than 600 patients in the ""critical"" group. Regeneron and Sanofi remain blinded to the ongoing portion of the Phase 3 trial and expect to report results by June.

In addition, the companies are also conducting a second trial in countries outside of the U.S. The Phase 3 trial of Kevzara in approximately 400 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection is currently enrolling in <span class=""xn-location"">Italy</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Spain</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">France</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Russia</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Israel</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>. Initial results from this second trial are expected in the third quarter of 2020. The findings from the U.S. trial will be shared immediately with the IDMC and similar amendments to the trial outside the U.S. will be considered.

The U.S. Kevzara trial has been funded in part with Federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; and BARDA, under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

The use of Kevzara to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 is investigational and has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Kevzara was jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. Kevzara is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that was invented using Regeneron's proprietary <i>VelocImmune<sup>®</sup></i> technology that utilizes a genetically-engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically-humanized immune system to produce optimized fully-human antibodies. <i>VelocImmune</i> technology has been used to create multiple antibodies including Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab) and Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab), which are approved in multiple countries around the world. Regeneron previously used its <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup></i> technologies to rapidly develop an investigational treatment for Ebola virus infection (currently under review by the FDA) and is now using these same technologies to create novel preventative and therapeutic antibodies for COVID-19.

<b>About Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab) Injection<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Kevzara is currently approved in multiple countries to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded to or tolerated previous therapy.

Kevzara binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is an immune system protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity, joint destruction and other systemic problems. Kevzara is being investigated for its ability to reduce the overactive inflammatory immune response associated with COVID-19 based on evidence of markedly elevated levels of IL-6 in severely ill patients infected with coronaviruses.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR KEVZARA<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab) INJECTION</b>

<b>KEVZARA can cause serious side effects including:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</b>: <b>KEVZARA is a medicine that affects your immune system. KEVZARA can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have serious infections while using KEVZARA, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections.</b> <b>Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting KEVZARA. Your healthcare provider should monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with KEVZARA.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Before starting KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you:
<ul>
 	<li>think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, with or without a fever. Symptoms may include sweats or chills, muscle aches, a cough, shortness of breath, blood in your phlegm, weight loss, warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body, diarrhea or stomach pain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal, if you feel very tired, or if you are being treated for an infection, get a lot of infections or have repeated infections</li>
 	<li>have diabetes, HIV, or a weakened immune system</li>
 	<li>have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB</li>
 	<li>live or have lived, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the <span class=""xn-location"">Ohio</span> and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance of getting certain fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis)</li>
 	<li>have or have had hepatitis</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>After starting KEVZARA, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><b>CHANGES IN CERTAIN LABORATORY TEST RESULTS:</b> Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before and after starting KEVZARA to check for low neutrophil (white blood cells that help the body fight off bacterial infections) counts, low platelet (blood cells that help with blood clotting and stop bleeding) counts, and an increase in certain liver function tests. Changes in test results are common with KEVZARA and can be severe. You may also have changes in other laboratory tests, such as your blood cholesterol levels. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests 4 to 8 weeks after starting KEVZARA and then every 6 months during treatment to check for an increase in blood cholesterol levels.</li>
 	<li><b>TEARS (PERFORATION) OF THE STOMACH OR INTESTINES: </b>Tell your healthcare provider if you have had a condition known as diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines. Some people using KEVZARA had tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go away.</li>
 	<li><b>CANCER:</b> KEVZARA may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.</li>
 	<li><b>SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS: </b>Serious allergic reactions can happen with KEVZARA. Get medical attention right away if you have any of the following signs: shortness of breath or trouble breathing; feeling dizzy or faint; swelling of your lips, tongue or face; moderate or severe stomach (abdominal) pain or vomiting; or chest pain.</li>
 	<li>Do not use KEVZARA if you are allergic to Sarilumab or any of the ingredients of KEVZARA.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Before using KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you
<ul>
 	<li>have an infection</li>
 	<li>have liver problems</li>
 	<li>have had stomach (abdominal) pain or a condition known as diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines</li>
 	<li>recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People who take KEVZARA should not receive live vaccines</li>
 	<li>plan to have surgery or a medical procedure</li>
 	<li>are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if KEVZARA will harm your unborn baby</li>
 	<li>are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you use KEVZARA. It is not known if KEVZARA passes into your breast milk</li>
 	<li>take any prescription or nonprescription medicines, vitamins or herbal supplements. It is especially important to tell your healthcare provider if you use any other medicines to treat your RA. Using KEVZARA with these medicines may increase your risk of infection</li>
 	<li>medicines that affect the way certain liver enzymes work. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one of these</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>The most common side effects include:
<ul>
 	<li>injection site redness</li>
 	<li>upper respiratory tract infection</li>
 	<li>urinary tract infection</li>
 	<li>nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose</li>

 	<li>A clinical trial has been given approval to determine if plasma donated by patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can help those battling the illness</li>
 	<li>If effective, a scaled-up national programme will deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS</li>
 	<li>This would provide enough convalescent plasma to treat 5,000 patients each week</li>
</ul>
Up to 5,000 severely ill patients with COVID-19 could soon be treated each week with plasma from those who have recovered from the illness as part of a new approach to treating the virus.

The national randomised clinical trial will help to determine if plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19, known as ‘convalescent plasma’, is an effective treatment for patients who are severely unwell with the illness. Plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients can be transfused to patients who are struggling to produce their own antibodies against the virus.

In parallel with the trial, the government is scaling up the national programme for collecting plasma so the treatment can be widely rolled out if it is shown to be effective. The collection of plasma would be ramped up over April and May to deliver up to 10,000 units of plasma to the NHS every week, enough to treat 5,000 COVID-19 patients per week.

Matt Hancock, Health and Social Care Secretary, said:
<blockquote>This global pandemic is the biggest public health emergency this generation has faced and we are doing absolutely everything we can to beat it.

The UK has world-leading life sciences and research sectors and I have every hope this treatment will be a major milestone in our fight against this disease.
<p class=""last-child"">Hundreds of people are participating in national trials already for potential treatments and the scaling up of convalescent plasma collection means thousands could potentially benefit from it in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
Professor Jonathan Van Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said:
<blockquote>The UK is leading the world’s largest trials to find a treatment for COVID-19, with over 7,000 people so far involved testing a range of medicines; we hope to add convalescent plasma to this list shortly.
<p class=""last-child"">Convalescent plasma has been used as an effective treatment for emerging infections in the past, and this step forward underpins our science-backed approach to fighting this virus.</p>
</blockquote>
Dr Gail Miflin, Chief Medical Officer, NHS Blood and Transplant, said:
<blockquote>As well as continuing to collect enough blood throughout this outbreak, we are also heavily involved in the national research response including major trials of this potential treatment.
<p class=""last-child"">We are rapidly building our capability to collect plasma so that we can quickly move into supplying hospitals at scale, should the proposed trial demonstrate patient benefit.</p>
</blockquote>
Northern Ireland Health Minister, Robin Swann MLA, said:
<blockquote>Two of the greatest strengths of the UK as we face this emergency are our world-leading health research capacity and the selflessness of our citizens.
<p class=""last-child"">The Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service and the wider Health and Social Care family are working with their colleagues across the UK to progress and participate in clinical trials on COVID-19.</p>
</blockquote>
Minister for Public Health in Scotland, Joe FitzPatrick, said:
<blockquote>The potential for convalescent plasma to aid those suffering from COVID-19 has to be confirmed through clinical trials. I am delighted to see the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Scottish donors will be playing a key part.

The wellbeing of donors, recipients and staff is a priority so there are strict conditions to protect everyone participating in the trial.
<p class=""last-child"">It is also important to recognise that this means that not everyone who recovers from Covid-19 will be able to donate.</p>
</blockquote>
Welsh Government Health Minister, Vaughan Gething, said:
<blockquote>
<p class=""last-child"">I’m very pleased to see clinical trials are now underway and to see Wales sharing expertise with the other UK nations on this programme. It has the potential to significantly improve patient recovery and save lives.</p>
</blockquote>
Plasma taken from recovered patients contains antibodies that recognise the virus and can reduce its growth. We will be using plasma from patients at least 28 days after recovery as by that time, antibody levels will have increased.

NHS Blood and Transplant will contact people in England who have recovered from confirmed COVID-19 infection and could be a possible plasma donor, and the plasma will be collected at their centres. Blood will be taken from donors from one arm, which is circulated through a machine that separates out the plasma, and returned into the other arm. The process takes about 45 minutes and provides 2 units of plasma per donation, which can also be frozen and stored ahead for any future need.

Convalescent plasma was used as an effective treatment during the SARS outbreak.

If people have a confirmed positive test result and they are willing to donate, they can also provide details to us through <a class=""govuk-link"" href=""https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/how-you-can-help/convalescent-plasma-clinical-trial/"" rel=""external"">NHSBT’s website.</a>

<ul>
 	<li>DHSC is working in collaboration with NHS Blood and Transplant and the other UK blood services, Public Health England and NHS Digital to deliver the programme.</li>
 	<li>Ongoing national clinical trial as part of REMAP-CAP – with the possibility of another trial later on if the results of the first trial are shown effective will investigate whether transfusions may improve a patient’s speed of recovery and chances of survival.</li>

“This collaboration with Merck provides critical support for the recently launched scientific trial being co-led by ISB and Swedish Medical Center, both part of the Providence St. Joseph Health network. We launched this trial with the urgent need to improve our understanding of COVID-19,” said Dr. Jim Heath, President, ISB. “By applying the full power of our systems biology capabilities, we hope to gain important insights into the molecular basis for the dramatically contrasting outcomes observed for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.”

Through this collaboration, scientists from ISB, health workers from the Swedish Medical Center, and a consortium of research organizations and biomedical companies will analyze blood samples and nasal swabs from Swedish Medical Center patients with SARS-CoV-2 using samples from several time points (initial presentation, acute illness and convalescence). Blood samples will be examined using proteomic, metabolomic, transcriptomics and genetic techniques to evaluate the impact of infection on different organs, and to identify potential biomarkers to predict the risk of severe disease. In addition, samples will be analyzed to create a profile of the immune response, including quantitative changes in immune cells in patients following SARS CoV-2 infection and characterization of neutralizing antibodies in samples from convalescent patients. These insights can be used to inform vaccine design and antibody therapy. Under the agreement, Merck will provide research funding and work with researchers at ISB to characterize targets for potential therapeutic intervention and vaccine development. The study will initially analyze samples from 200 patients with the potential to expand to 300.

“Understanding the molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of the immune response to this virus, is essential to the development of effective interventions,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are eager to advance this work with ISB, and to share our findings with the broader scientific community. Interdicting the COVID-19 pandemic presents a daunting global health challenge, demanding unprecedented collaboration across the international scientific and medical communities to which we are proud to contribute.”

The principal investigators of the study are ISB’s Heath and Dr. Jason D. Goldman, Swedish Medical Center. Initial funding support for the study came from the Wilke Family Foundation, M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust, Swedish Foundation, Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and Washington State Andy Hill CARE Fund. Other research collaborators on the study include Stanford University, Adaptive Biotechnologies, Bloodworks Northwest, Isoplexis, Metabolon, Nanostring, Olink, Providence Molecular Genomics Laboratory, Scisco Genetics and 10x Genomics.

</ul>
Basel, 28 April 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today presented 1-year data from FIREFISH Part 2, a pivotal global study evaluating risdiplam in infants aged 1 – 7 months old with symptomatic Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The study met its primary endpoint with 29% of infants (12/41; p&lt;0.0001) sitting without support for five seconds by month 12, as assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (BSID-III). No infants achieve this milestone in the natural history of Type 1 SMA. In addition, 18 (43.9%) infants were able to hold their head upright, 13 (31.7%) were able to roll to the side and 2 (4.9%) infants were able to stand with support, as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination 2 (HINE-2). Safety for risdiplam in the FIREFISH study was consistent with its known safety profile.

“These results confirm the clinically meaningful efficacy of risdiplam in infants with an advanced and difficult-to-treat disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph. D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We thank the SMA community for their partnership and especially the 62 families from around the world who participated in Parts 1 and 2 of the FIREFISH study.”

The data were selected for the 72nd American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting and will be made available online via virtual presentation in the coming weeks (in lieu of an in-person event). Roche leads the clinical development of risdiplam, an investigational, orally administered survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) splicing modifier for SMA, as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.

At the time of analysis, the median duration of treatment was 15.2 months and the median age was 20.7 months. Ninety-three percent (38/41) of infants were alive and 85.4% (35/41) were event-free. Without treatment, the median age of death or permanent ventilation was 13.5 months in a natural history cohort. Three infants experienced fatal complications of their disease within the first three months of treatment. None of these has been attributed by the investigator as related to risdiplam. Ninety per cent (37/41) had a CHOP-INTEND* score increase of at least 4 points, with 56% (23/41) achieving a score above 40; the median increase was 20 points. Without treatment, infants with Type 1 SMA show a decrease in CHOP-INTEND scores over time.

In an exploratory endpoint, 95% of infants who were alive at 12 months (36/38) maintained the ability to swallow and 89% (34/38) were able to feed orally. In contrast, in a natural history cohort, all infants with Type 1 SMA older than 12 months required feeding support.

“These results are particularly encouraging given the median age at enrolment was 5.3 months, so these infants already had progressed disease,” said Professor Laurent Servais, FIREFISH investigator and Professor of Paediatric Neuromuscular Diseases at the MDUK Oxford Neuromuscular Centre. “Maintaining the ability to swallow is particularly important as it helps infants to feed and suggests risdiplam has a major effect on bulbar function.”

Safety for risdiplam in the FIREFISH study was consistent with its previously reported safety profile and no new safety signals were identified. The most common adverse events (AE) were upper respiratory tract infection (46.3%), pneumonia (39%), pyrexia (39%), constipation (19.5%) nasopharyngitis (12.2%), rhinitis (12.2%) and diarrhoea (9.8%). The most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (31.7%), bronchiolitis (4.9%), respiratory failure (4.9%) and hypotonia (4.9%).

Risdiplam is being studied in a broad clinical trial programme in SMA, with patients ranging from birth to 60 years old, and includes pre-symptomatic patients and those previously treated with other SMA-targeting therapies. The clinical trial programme was designed to represent the broad, real-world spectrum of people living with this disease with the aim of ensuring access for all appropriate patients.

In November 2019, the U.S Food and Drug Administration granted Priority Review for risdiplam with an expected decision on approval by August 24, 2020.

<strong>About SMA</strong>
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe, inherited, progressive neuromuscular disease that causes devastating muscle atrophy and disease-related complications. It is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and one of the most common rare diseases, affecting approximately one in 11,000 babies. SMA leads to the progressive loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

SMA is caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that results in a deficiency of SMN protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and increasing evidence suggests SMA is a multi-system disorder and the loss of SMN protein may affect many tissues and cells, which can stop the body from functioning.

<strong>About risdiplam</strong>
Risdiplam is an investigational survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) splicing modifier for SMA and is an orally administered liquid. It is designed to durably increase and sustain SMN protein levels both throughout the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues of the body. It is being evaluated for its potential ability to help the SMN2 gene produce more functional SMN protein throughout the body.

Risdiplam was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in 2017. At this time, we have filed in Brazil, Chile, China, Indonesia, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan.

Risdiplam is currently being evaluated in four multicentre trials in people with SMA:
?   FIREFISH (NCT02913482) – an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants. The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determine the dose for Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated for 24 months, followed by an open-label extension. Enrolment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 is to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds).
?   SUNFISH (NCT02908685) – SUNFISH is a two part, double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal study in people aged 2-25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 (n=51) determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. Part 2 (n=180) evaluated motor function using total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. MFM-32 is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. The study met its primary endpoint.
?   JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) – an open-label exploratory trial in people with SMA aged 6 months–60 years who have been previously treated with SMA-directed therapies. The study has completed recruitment (n=174).
?   RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) – an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study, investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in babies (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.

CEPI will invest an initial US$3.5 million<b> </b>in a partnering agreement with Clover Biopharmaceuticals AUS Pty Ltd (“Clover Australia”) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Inc (China) (“Clover Biopharmaceuticals”), bringing the organisation’s total investment in COVID-19 vaccine research &amp; development to US$39.6m.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“We are delighted to partner with Clover Australia on their innovative COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine candidate. They produced their vaccine within a month of the virus sequence becoming available, and they have rapidly advanced toward a first in human trial. ”</p>

This initial CEPI investment will support Clover Australia in its efforts to initiate a phase 1 clinical trial in Australia of its COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine candidate. This innovative vaccine candidate is based on Clover Biopharmaceutical’s proprietary Trimer-Tag<sup>©</sup> vaccine technology platform, which is a novel way to produce the spike proteins of the COVID-19 virus in a native trimeric form for use in a vaccine. If successful in clinical trials, Clover Biopharmaceuticals has the capacity to rapidly scale up the production of the vaccine using its in-house biomanufacturing capabilities.

Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI said:

<i>“We are delighted to partner with Clover Australia on their innovative COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine candidate. They produced their vaccine within a month of the virus sequence becoming available, and they have rapidly advanced toward a first in human trial.</i>

<i>“This vaccine candidate is an important new addition to the CEPI portfolio. CEPI has invested in a diverse range of innovative vaccine platforms, as well as more established vaccine technologies, to maximise our chances of success as we pursue our ambition of making COVID-19 vaccines available for broad use.”</i>

Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer of Clover Biopharmaceuticals and co-inventor of COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine candidate said:

<i>“At Clover Biopharmaceuticals, we are proud to receive CEPI’s funding and support for Clover Australia, which are critical to enabling the ongoing development and acceleration of our COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine program that utilizes our innovative Trimer-Tag<sup>©</sup> platform technology. We have been working tirelessly and hope to contribute significantly to global efforts in fighting this pandemic that has affected us all.”</i>

To date, CEPI has provided initial support and funding to Curevac, Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna, Inc., Novavax, Inc., The University of Hong Kong, The University of Oxford, The University of Queensland and a consortium led by Institut Pasteur to develop COVID-19 vaccine candidates<sup>1</sup>.<sup>2,3,4,5</sup>

This investment is the result of a recent global call for proposals that CEPI issued in early February,<sup>6</sup> which invited funding applications for vaccine technology that could be used to rapidly develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus, and most importantly at scale and with the necessary equitable access provisions.

CEPI recently officially announced that it has opened a Representative Office in Shanghai. Through its Shanghai Representative Office,CEPI will seek cooperation with China in the prevention and control of pandemic diseases, including funding of public health research projects, technical research and development of vaccines, and international scientific, technology and development cooperation and exchanges.

COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine

Utilizing Clover’s proprietary Trimer-Tag<sup>©</sup> technology, S-Trimer is a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein subunit vaccine candidate. Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry, making it the primary target antigen for vaccine development. S-Trimer resembles the native trimeric viral spike protein and is produced via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system.

<strong><em>–  Designation Represents Positive Progress for a Unique Patient Population in Need of Targeted Therapy Options</em></strong>

</div>
<div class=""mainBody"">

<strong>Cambridge, MASS. &amp; Osaka, JAPAN, April 27, 2020 –</strong> Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (<a href=""https://www.takeda.com/investors/"">TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK</a>) (“Takeda”) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for its investigational drug mobocertinib (TAK-788) for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. There are currently no approved therapies designed to treat this specific form of NSCLC. Mobocertinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) designed to selectively target EGFR and human EGFR 2 (HER2) exon 20 insertion mutations.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based on the overall response rate (ORR) and the long-term benefit seen in patients who responded in a Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of mobocertinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors harbor EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and have been previously treated with systemic chemotherapy. This signals a potential advancement in addressing the needs of patients for whom no targeted therapies exist and current treatment options provide limited benefit.

“We are pleased that the FDA has recognized the therapeutic potential mobocertinib offers for patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutant NSCLC who are desperately in need of effective treatment options,” said Christopher Arendt, Head, Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “At Takeda, we are committed to developing novel medicines for hard-to-treat diseases. Establishing Breakthrough Therapy Designation for mobocertinib is one step forward in our efforts to help change the current standard of care for this underserved population.”

“Although most EGFR mutations can be targeted by currently available TKIs, people with exon 20 insertion mutations often suffer and feel forgotten since available EGFR inhibitors don’t work well in their cancer,” said Jill Feldman, Lung Cancer Patient, Advocate, and Co-Founder of the EGFR Resisters. “We are excited by the potential this treatment has to extend the lives of people who have had no approved treatment options to target their disease.”

Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. FDA is granted to accelerate the development and regulatory review of investigational drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening ailments. Agents with this designation have shown preliminary clinical evidence that indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.

Takeda will present for the first time the development of mobocertinib, including the first public disclosure of the structure, during the <a href=""https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-annual-meeting-2020/aacr-virtual-annual-meeting-i/"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-annual-meeting-2020/aacr-virtual-annual-meeting-i/"" data-action=""External"">American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Virtual Annual Meeting I</a> in a New Drugs on the Horizon <a href=""https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9045/session/35"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9045/session/35"" data-action=""External"">session</a> on Tuesday, April 28, from 11:14-11:34 a.m. ET.
<h4><strong>About EGFR Exon 20 Insertion-Mutant NSCLC</strong></h4>
NSCLC is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of the estimated 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed each year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.<sup>1,2</sup> Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations make up only about 1-2% of patients with NSCLC.<sup>3,4</sup> This disease carries a worse prognosis than other EGFR mutations because there are currently no FDA-approved therapies that target exon 20 mutations, and current EGFR TKIs and chemotherapy provide limited benefit for these patients.
<h4><strong>About Mobocertinib (TAK-788)</strong></h4>
Mobocertinib is a potent, small-molecule TKI specifically designed to selectively target EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. In 2019, the U.S. FDA granted mobocertinib Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of lung cancer with HER2 mutations or EGFR mutations including exon 20 insertion mutations.

Results from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of mobocertinib, which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of mobocertinib at 160 mg once daily in previously treated patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions, showed mobocertinib yielded a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.3 months and a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) of 43% (n=12/28) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutant NSCLC. The safety profile of mobocertinib was manageable (N= 72). The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (85%), nausea (43%), rash (36%), vomiting (29%) and decreased appetite (25%). These results were presented at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.

The mobocertinib development program began in the NSCLC population and is expected to expand to additional underserved populations in other tumor types. Mobocertinib is an investigational drug for which efficacy and safety have not been established.

MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, April 27, 2020 /<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced today that Health Canada authorized use of FreeStyle Libre system, the world's leading<sup>1</sup> sensor-based glucose monitoring technology, in hospital setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. This will permit frontline healthcare workers to remotely monitor patients' glucose status<sup>2</sup> and glucose history. In addition, Abbott will donate 3,000 FreeStyle Libre sensors to ensure hospitals in need have immediate access to the technology.

""The in-hospital challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic have forced frontline workers to think creatively about how to safeguard against unnecessary exposure between themselves and patients, especially people with diabetes,"" said Bruce Perkins, M.D., Director, Leadership Sinai Centre for Diabetes and Clinician-Scientist, University of Toronto. ""Having access to sensor-based glucose monitoring technology in hospitals is one such creative solution to significantly help healthcare workers closely monitor glucose status while limiting direct contact and preserving valuable personal protective equipment.""

With a one-second scan using a reader or smartphone<sup>3</sup> over the FreeStyle Libre sensor worn on the back of the upper arm, glucose readings are measured every minute and the user can get current glucose measurements, historical trends and patterns, and arrows showing where glucose levels are going without having to fingerstick<sup>4</sup>. At the same time, physicians will receive glucose data and actionable information remotely to help make important treatment decisions through LibreView<sup>5</sup>, a secure, cloud-based diabetes management system available at no cost to healthcare providers and users. Recent studies showed that users of the FreeStyle Libre system have improved glucose control<sup>6</sup>, decreased time in hyperglycemia<sup>7</sup> and hypoglycemia<sup>8 </sup>as well as reduced hospitalizations<sup>9</sup> and HbA1C<sup>10</sup> levels.

""Providing frontline healthcare workers with technology and equipment is critical in the fight against COVID-19,"" said Marie-Flore Nabor, general manager of Abbott's diabetes care business in Canada. ""Health Canada's quick action to make FreeStyle Libre sensors available in hospitals will help frontline healthcare workers better monitor and manage the glucose levels of patients and, at the same time, help limit COVID-19 exposure.""

More than 15% of Canadians diagnosed with COVID-19 are hospitalized, according to Health Canada<sup>11</sup>. The use of the FreeStyle Libre system in Canadian hospitals received support from the country's leading diabetes organizations, including Diabetes Canada and Diabète Quebec.

<p class=""bwalignc""><em>600 participant Phase 2 study to begin upon IND acceptance and safety data from ongoing NIH-led Phase 1 study</em></p>
<p class=""bwalignc""><em>Planning underway for Phase 3 study; study expected to begin in the fall of 2020</em></p>
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 27, 2020-- Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced that it has submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the company’s mRNA vaccine candidate (mRNA-1273) against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to evaluate mRNA-1273 in Phase 2 and late-stage studies if supported by safety data from the Phase 1 study led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Moderna has received initial feedback from the FDA on the design of the planned Phase 2 study, which is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2020. This study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two vaccinations of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart. Each subject will be assigned to receive placebo, a 50 µg or a 250 µg dose at both vaccinations. The company intends to enroll 600 healthy participants across two cohorts of adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300). Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination.

“Submitting this IND is an important next step in the clinical development of our mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and we are moving rapidly to potentially address this global health emergency,” said Tal Zaks, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at Moderna. “We look forward to launching this Phase 2 study as soon as possible, which will provide important information about the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.”

Subject to data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies and discussions with regulators, a Phase 3 study could begin in the fall of 2020. <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.modernatx.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fmoderna-announces-award-us-government-agency-barda-483-million&amp;esheet=52210412&amp;newsitemid=20200427005839&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Funding&amp;index=1&amp;md5=4c117bf343558c538d10589dcddf9d03"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Funding</a> from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, supported the planning for these studies and also will support the late-stage clinical development programs, as well as the scale-up of mRNA-1273 manufacturing.

“Safe, effective vaccines are critical to ending this pandemic and preventing future outbreaks of SARS-COV-2,” said BARDA Acting Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “The next steps announced today for this particular vaccine highlight the value of collaboration among government agencies including BARDA and NIAID, and the private sector, to move vaccines and other medical countermeasures forward as rapidly as possible.”

<strong>About the NIAID-led Phase 1 Study</strong>

An open-label Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 is being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases under its own Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The Phase 1 study, which began on March 16, 2020, completed enrollment of 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years in the original three dose cohorts (25 µg, 100 µg and 250 µg). The study is <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.niaid.nih.gov%2Fnews-events%2Fnih-clinical-trial-vaccine-covid-19-now-enrolling-older-adults&amp;esheet=52210412&amp;newsitemid=20200427005839&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=enrolling&amp;index=2&amp;md5=56517479f1066eff8db024a2fb28da21"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">enrolling</a> an additional six cohorts: three cohorts of older adults (ages 56-70) and three cohorts of elderly adults (ages 71 and above). Data from the original cohort of healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years will be reported once available.

<strong>About mRNA-1273</strong>

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was selected by Moderna in collaboration with investigators from Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing.

Based on clinical experience across Phase 1 studies, the company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.modernatx.com%2Fprogram-detail&amp;esheet=52210412&amp;newsitemid=20200427005839&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=nine+development+candidates&amp;index=4&amp;md5=7bf33c71d8b4d7657f4c7490b61f1d78"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">nine development candidates</a> in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

<em>Vaccines against respiratory infections</em>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults (mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1172 or V172 with Merck)</li>
 	<li>RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)</li>
 	<li>Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)</li>
 	<li>Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (mRNA-1273)</li>
 	<li>Influenza H7N9 (mRNA-1851)</li>
</ul>
<em>Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby</em>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647)</li>
 	<li>Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA)</li>
</ul>
<em>Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections</em>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189)</li>
</ul>
To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for seven prophylactic vaccines (H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3, CMV and Zika). Moderna’s CMV vaccine is currently in a Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna’s investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.

 	<li><em>Cosentyx</em><em><sup>®</sup></em><em> is the first fully-human IL-17A inhibitor indicated for patients in Europe with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), which forms part of the axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) disease spectrum</em></li>
 	<li><em>There are approximately 1.7 million patients with nr-axSpA in the top five EU countries and US</em><em><sup>1</sup></em></li>
 	<li><em>Cosentyx is also approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)<sup>2-4</sup></em></li>
 	<li><em>This approval underlines Cosentyx leadership in rheumatology and immuno-dermatology, with plans to expand to 10 indications over the next 10 years</em><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Basel, April 29, 2020</strong> — Novartis, a leader in rheumatology and immuno-dermatology,  today announced the European Commission (EC) has approved Cosentyx<sup>®</sup> (secukinumab) for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA).

“This approval of Cosentyx for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis means clinicians across Europe now have an effective new treatment option to help patients gain relief from the burden of this painful, debilitating disease and achieve a better quality of life both at home and at work,” said Atul Deodhar, MD, Professor of Medicine and Medical Director of Rheumatology Clinics at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, USA, and an investigator in the PREVENT clinical trial.

The approval is based on data from the Phase III PREVENT study, in which Cosentyx met the primary endpoint. In the study, 41.5% of nr-axSpA patients treated with Cosentyx 150 mg showing a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in disease activity versus placebo (41.5% vs 29.2%: p&lt;0.05), as measured by at least a 40% improvement in ASAS40 at week 16<sup>5</sup>, with improvements continued through week 52. Statistically significant improvements in secondary endpoints were also demonstrated, including pain, disease burden and health-related quality of life<sup>5</sup>. PREVENT is the largest ever study of a biologic in patients with nr-axSpA<sup>5</sup>.

“Whether a patient has nr-axSpA or AS, the condition has a significant impact on their everyday life. We therefore welcome the news that Cosentyx has gained approval for the treatment of this form of axial spondyloarthritis because it enables patients to realize relief from their symptoms earlier in the spectrum of disease,” said Eric Hughes, Global Development Unit Head, Immunology, Hepatology &amp; Dermatology at Novartis. “This is a firm demonstration of our commitment to reimagine medicine for patients and a step forward in our plans to expand Cosentyx across ten indications over the next ten years.”

Novartis is working closely with all stakeholders to ensure that eligible European patients can start benefitting from Cosentyx as quickly as possible. Novartis has also submitted Cosentyx for review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for the treatment of adults with nr-axSpA.

<strong>About axSpA</strong>
AxSpA is a spectrum of long-term inflammatory disease characterized by chronic inflammatory back pain<sup>6</sup>. The axSpA spectrum includes AS, in which joint damage is generally visible on x-ray, and nr-axSpA, in which joint damage is not visible on x-ray<sup>6,7</sup>. Both parts of the disease spectrum have a comparable symptom burden, including nocturnal waking caused by pain, spinal pain, morning stiffness, fatigue and functional disability<sup>8</sup>. If left untreated, axSpA impairs activity, leads to lost work time and has a significant impact on quality of life, including family relationships<sup>8</sup>.

<strong>About Cosentyx</strong>
Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human biologic that directly inhibits IL-17A, a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of PsO, PsA and AS<sup>9-12</sup>.

Cosentyx is backed by robust clinical evidence, including five-year data across three indications of PsO, PsA and AS, as well as data from real world evidence<sup>3-5</sup>. These data strengthen the unique position of Cosentyx as a rapid and long-lasting comprehensive treatment across axSpA, PsA and psoriatic disease, with more than 300,000 patients treated worldwide with Cosentyx since launch<sup>13</sup>.

<strong>About PREVENT</strong>
PREVENT is an ongoing two-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (with a two-year extension phase) to investigate the efficacy and safety of Cosentyx, in patients with active nr-axSpA. The study enrolled 555 male and female adult patients with active nr-axSpA (with onset before 45 years of age, spinal pain rated as &gt;=40/100 on a visual analog scale (VAS) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) &gt;=4) and who had been taking at least two different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the highest dose up to 4 weeks prior to study start. Patients may have previously taken a TNF inhibitor (not more than one) but had an inadequate response. Of the 555 patients enrolled in the study, 501 (90.3%) were biologic naïve. Patients were allocated to one of three treatment groups: Cosentyx 150 mg subcutaneously with loading dose (induction: 150 mg secukinumab subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks, then maintenance with 150 mg secukinumab monthly); Cosentyx 150 mg no loading dose (150 mg secukinumab subcutaneously monthly), or placebo (induction of subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks, followed by maintenance of once-monthly)<sup>14</sup>.

The primary endpoints are the proportion of patients achieving an ASAS40 response with Cosentyx 150 mg at Weeks 16 and 52 in TNF-naive patients. Secondary endpoints include among others change in BASDAI over time and change in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score with CRP (ASDAS-CRP)<sup>14</sup>.

<p align=""justify"">MAINZ, Germany and NEW YORK, April 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech” or “the Company”) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) have announced that the first cohort of BioNTech’s Phase 1/2 clinical trial has been dosed. Twelve study participants were dosed with vaccine candidate BNT162 in Germany since dosing began on April 23, 2020. The trial is the first clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate in Germany. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to initiate trials for BNT162 in the United States upon regulatory approval, which is expected shortly.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The dose escalation portion of the Phase 1/2 trial will include approximately 200 healthy subjects between the ages of 18 to 55 and will target a dose range of 1 µg to 100 µg, aiming to determine the optimal dose for further studies as well as to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. The study will also assess the effects of repeated vaccination following a prime injection for the three vaccine candidates that contain uridine containing mRNA (uRNA) or nucleoside modified mRNA (modRNA). A fourth vaccine candidate, which contains self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA) will be evaluated after a single dose of vaccine. Subjects with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease will be included in the second part of the study.</p>
<p align=""justify"">BioNTech and Pfizer are jointly developing BNT162. During the clinical development stage, BioNTech will provide its partner’s clinical supply of the vaccine from its GMP-certified mRNA manufacturing facilities in Europe. BioNTech is collaborating with Fosun Pharma to develop BNT162 in China, where the companies expect to conduct trials.</p>

<strong>TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 28, 2020</strong> - Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) and Harvard University (President: Lawrence S. Bacow, J.D., M.P.P., Ph.D., “Harvard”) have established a three-year strategic research alliance to support multiple, multi-year research projects initiated by faculty at Harvard, focused on the research and development of innovative therapeutics and technologies of mutual interest.

The alliance will provide crucial support to future collaborative research efforts when the academic laboratories return to regular activities following the significant disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the new alliance, Astellas will issue one or more “challenges” based on Astellas’ research scopes to inspire research proposals by Harvard faculty, a number of which will then be selected by Astellas for project funding based on strong scientific rationale and projected impact on value for patients. Projects may span a range of developmental stages, from early investigations into the biological mechanisms of disease, to the identification of possible therapeutic targets, or to the generation and validation of new therapeutic entities.

“Academic-industry collaboration is vital to the advancement of biomedical discovery and to ensure that promising new therapies are developed to their fullest potential,” said Vivian Berlin, Managing Director of Strategic Partnerships in Harvard Office of Technology Development. “This research alliance with Astellas will not only provide important funding to Harvard labs but will also expand our scientific community of collaborators to make progress against major challenges in human health and medicine. Alliances like this spur creativity and drive rapid innovation for the benefit of patients in need.”

“We are delighted to build upon our successful collaborations with Harvard by establishing this broader strategic research alliance,” said Akihiko Iwai, Ph.D., President of Drug Discovery Research at Astellas. “Astellas has a long-standing commitment to the Boston-area life sciences ecosystem, with a rich source of world-class institutions and talent dedicated to turning innovative science into value for patients. Through this research alliance, we aim to incorporate the latest scientific innovation into our R&amp;D pipeline to accelerate our drug discovery efforts from early-stage through to clinical stage in areas that match with our strategic focus. ”

Under the new research alliance, projects may be selected from labs across Harvard University; the request for proposals will be circulated widely, at a later date. Astellas and Harvard are determined to initiate this alliance effort to explore new collaborative research opportunities even in these challenging times.

Novartis today announced plans to initiate a Phase III clinical trial to study canakinumab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The CAN-COVID trial will examine the efficacy of utilizing canakinumab, an interleukin (IL)-1ß blocker, to treat a type of severe immune overreaction called cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in people with COVID-19 pneumonia. CRS could lead to life-threatening complications in patients with COVID-19<sup>1-3</sup>.The study builds on early evidence from lab tests of COVID-19 patients who showed elevated IL-1ß levels, among other cytokines<sup>2,4</sup>.

Novartis aims to rapidly enroll 450 patients at multiple medical centers across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and the US and randomize them to receive either canakinumab or placebo on top of standard of care (SoC). The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the benefit of canakinumab in combination with SoC in increasing the chance of survival without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Top-line results are anticipated late summer 2020.

This trial initiation is part of the overall Novartis approach to applying our best science to tackling the issues related to COVID-19 and further underscores Novartis commitment to quickly deploy R&amp;D resources, medicines, clinical expertise and philanthropic aid to combat COVID-19.

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an additional recommended dosage of 400 mg every six weeks (Q6W) for KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, across all adult indications, including monotherapy and combination therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on pharmacokinetic data, the relationship of exposure to efficacy and the relationship of exposure to safety. Continued approval for this dosing may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. This new dosage option will be available in addition to the current dose of 200 mg every three weeks (Q3W).

“The important social distancing measures for COVID-19 have created a number of challenges for people with cancer, including keeping to planned treatment schedules,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “Today’s approval of an every six-week dosing schedule for KEYTRUDA gives doctors an option to reduce how often patients are at the clinic for their treatment.”

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong>

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>

<b>Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis.

Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib</i>

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%).

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>

Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

<b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b><i>-- Study Demonstrates Similar Efficacy with 5- and 10-Day Dosing Durations of Remdesivir --</i></b></p>
FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 29, 2020-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced topline results from the open-label, Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 disease. The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 – 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.

“Unlike traditional drug development, we are attempting to evaluate an investigational agent alongside an evolving global pandemic. Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 and how to best utilize the drug,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “These study results complement data from the placebo-controlled study of remdesivir conducted by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and help to determine the optimal duration of treatment with remdesivir. The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir. This is particularly important in the setting of a pandemic, to help hospitals and healthcare workers treat more patients in urgent need of care.”

Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.

In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50 percent of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5 percent (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8 percent (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery.

Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7 percent (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64 percent (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61 percent (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.

<b>Impact of Earlier Treatment</b>

In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62 percent of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital, compared with 49 percent of patients who were treated late.

“These data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical improvement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,” said Aruna Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, and one of the lead investigators of the study. “While additional data are still needed, these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimized, if proven safe and effective.”

Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10 percent of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3 percent (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0 percent (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.

Key efficacy and safety results from the study are included in the table below.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About the SIMPLE Trials</span></b>

Gilead initiated two randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trials for remdesivir, the SIMPLE studies, in countries with high prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

The first SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing regimens of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. The initial phase of the study randomized 397 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive remdesivir 200 mg on the first day, followed by remdesivir 100 mg each day until day 5 or 10, administered intravenously, in addition to standard of care. An expansion phase of the study was recently added and will enroll an additional 5,600 patients, including patients on mechanical ventilation. The study is being conducted at 180 trial sites around the world, including sites in the United States, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Remdesivir</span></b>

<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford today announced an agreement for the global development and distribution of the University’s potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2.

The collaboration aims to bring to patients the potential vaccine known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, being developed by the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group, at the University of Oxford. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca would be responsible for development and worldwide manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “As COVID-19 continues its grip on the world, the need for a vaccine to defeat the virus is urgent. This collaboration brings together the University of Oxford’s world-class expertise in vaccinology and AstraZeneca’s global development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Our hope is that, by joining forces, we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, AstraZeneca, said: “The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have a longstanding relationship to advance basic research and we are hugely excited to be working with them on advancing a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 around the world. We are looking forward to working with the University of Oxford and innovative companies such as Vaccitech, as part of our new partnership.”

Alok Sharma, UK Business Secretary, said: “This collaboration between Oxford University and AstraZeneca is a vital step that could help rapidly advance the manufacture of a coronavirus vaccine. It will also ensure that, should the vaccine being developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute work, it will be available as early as possible, helping to protect thousands of lives from this disease.”

Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, said: “Our partnership with AstraZeneca will be a major force in the struggle against pandemics for many years to come. We believe that together we will be in a strong position to start immunising against coronavirus once we have an effective approved vaccine. Sadly, the risk of new pandemics will always be with us and the new research centre will enhance the world’s preparedness and our speed of reaction the next time we face such a challenge.”

Professor Louise Richardson, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, said: “Like my colleagues all across Oxford, I am deeply proud of the work of our extraordinarily talented team of academics in the Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group. They represent the best tradition of research, teaching and contributing to the world around us, that has been the driving mission of the University of Oxford for centuries. Like people all across the country, we are wishing them success in developing an effective vaccine. If they are successful, our partnership with AstraZeneca will ensure that the British people and people across the world, especially in low and middle income countries, will be protected from this terrible virus as quickly as possible.”

The potential vaccine entered Phase I clinical trials last week to study safety and efficacy in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, across five trial centres in Southern England. Data from the Phase I trial could be available next month. Advancement to late-stage trials should take place by the middle of this year.

<b>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19</b>

Developed at the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, and working with the Oxford Vaccine Group, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 uses a viral vector based on a weakened version of the common cold (adenovirus) containing the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, which primes the immune system to attack COVID-19 if it later infects the body.

The recombinant adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1) was chosen to generate a strong immune response from a single dose and it is not replicating, so cannot cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual. Vaccines made from the ChAdOx1 virus have been given to more than 320 people to date and have been shown to be safe and well tolerated, although they can cause temporary side effects such as a temperature, flu-like symptoms, headache or sore arm.

<strong>Issued: London, UK</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Zejula is the only oral monotherapy available as first-line maintenance treatment for women regardless of <em>BRCA</em> mutational status, addressing a high unmet need in ovarian cancer</li>
 	<li>New individualised starting dose based on the patient’s baseline weight and/or platelet count approved for first-line maintenance treatment; lower rates of haematological adverse events were observed with the individualised dosing group</li>
 	<li>The supplemental New Drug Application was approved under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program</li>
</ul>
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Zejula (niraparib), an oral, once-daily poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, as a monotherapy maintenance treatment for women with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, regardless of biomarker status. Until now, only 20% of women with ovarian cancer, those with a BRCA mutation (BRCAm), were eligible to be treated with a PARP inhibitor as monotherapy in the first-line maintenance setting.<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/fda-approves-parp-inhibitor-in-first-line-monotherapy-maintenance-treatment-for-women-with-platinum-responsive-advanced-ovarian-cancer-regardless-of-biomarker-status/#_ednref1"" name=""_edn1"">[i]</a>

Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&amp;D, GSK, said: “Women with advanced ovarian cancer have a five-year survival rate of less than 50%. This expanded indication means that many more women with this devastating disease can receive earlier treatment with Zejula, which can extend the time it takes for their cancer to progress.”

Zejula is the only once-daily PARP inhibitor approved in the US as monotherapy for women with advanced ovarian cancer beyond those with <em>BRCAm</em> disease in the first-line and recurrent maintenance treatment settings, as well as late-line primary treatment settings.

This new indication is supported by data from the phase III PRIMA study (ENGOT-OV26/GOG-3012), which enrolled patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer following a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of biomarker status. The PRIMA study enrolled women who had higher risk of disease progression, a population with high unmet needs and limited treatment options.

Dr. Bradley Monk, PRIMA investigator, US Oncology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Phoenix Creighton University School of Medicine at St. Joseph's Hospital Phoenix, said: “PRIMA was designed for patients with ovarian cancer who have a high unmet need. The positive data observed regardless of biomarker status in this study is extremely encouraging and suggests benefit beyond the <em>BRCAm</em> population. This approval is an important step forward in the treatment of ovarian cancer. In my opinion, maintenance treatment with niraparib should be considered an option for appropriate patients who responded to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy versus active surveillance.”

The primary endpoint in the PRIMA study was progression-free survival (PFS) analysed sequentially, first in the homologous recombination deficient (HRd) population, then in the overall population. The PRIMA study significantly improved PFS for patients treated with Zejula, regardless of biomarker status. In the HRd population, Zejula resulted in a 57% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death vs. placebo (HR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.59; p&lt;0.0001), and a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death vs. placebo in the overall population (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.76; p&lt;0.0001).

Zejula’s safety profile, as demonstrated by the PRIMA results, was consistent with clinical trial experience. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events with Zejula included thrombocytopenia (39%), anaemia (31%) and neutropenia (21%).

At initiation of the PRIMA study, patients received a fixed starting dose of 300 mg of Zejula once-daily. The study was later amended to incorporate an individualised starting dose of either 200 mg or 300 mg of Zejula once-daily based on the patient’s baseline weight and/or platelet count. Lower rates of grade 3 and 4 haematologic treatment-emergent adverse events were observed with an individualised starting dose, compared to the overall population, including thrombocytopenia (21% compared to 39%), anaemia (23% compared to 31%) and neutropenia (15% compared to 21%).

The Zejula US prescribing information has been updated to include the individualised starting dose of 200 mg or 300 mg once-daily based on patients’ baseline weight and/or platelet count for the first-line maintenance treatment indication. The starting dose for recurrent ovarian cancer and late-line treatment settings is 300 mg once-daily.

“It’s so important for patients with ovarian cancer to have treatment options, and this approval is positive news for our community,” said Audra Moran, President and CEO, Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance. “PARP inhibitors represent a major advancement in the fight against ovarian cancer, and having a new first-line maintenance option for platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer patients — regardless of BRCA mutation status — is especially exciting. We are determined to keep funding research and partnering with scientists who are on the frontline of finding new treatments like this one to help those impacted by this disease.”

PRIMA study results were previously presented at the 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress and published in the <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1910962"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">New England Journal of Medicine</a>.

Zejula is not approved for use in first-line maintenance treatment outside the US.

</ul>
Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for ZEJULA.

<strong>Important Safety Information</strong>

<strong>Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia</strong> (MDS/AML), including some fatal cases, was reported in 15 patients (0.8%) out of 1785 patients treated with ZEJULA monotherapy in clinical trials. The duration of therapy in patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML varied from 0.5 months to 4.9 years. These patients had received prior chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents including radiotherapy. Discontinue ZEJULA if MDS/AML is confirmed.

<strong>Hematologic adverse reactions</strong> (thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia) have been reported in patients receiving ZEJULA. The overall incidence of Grade =3 thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia were reported, respectively, in 39%, 31%, and 21% of patients receiving ZEJULA in PRIMA; 29%, 25%, and 20% of patients receiving ZEJULA in NOVA; and 28%, 27%, and 13% of patients receiving ZEJULA in QUADRA. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occurred, respectively, in 4%, 2%, and 2% of patients in PRIMA; 3%, 1%, and 2% of patients in NOVA; and 4%, 2%, and 1% of patients in QUADRA. In patients who were administered a starting dose of ZEJULA based on baseline weight or platelet count in PRIMA, Grade =3 thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia were reported, respectively, in 22%, 23%, and 15% of patients receiving ZEJULA. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occurred, respectively, in 3%, 3%, and 2% of patients. Do not start ZEJULA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by prior chemotherapy (= Grade 1). Monitor complete blood counts weekly for the first month, monthly for the next 11 months, and periodically thereafter. If hematological toxicities do not resolve within 28 days following interruption, discontinue ZEJULA, and refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations.

<strong>Hypertension and hypertensive crisis </strong>have been reported in patients receiving ZEJULA. Grade 3-4 hypertension occurred in 6% of patients receiving ZEJULA vs 1% of patients receiving placebo in PRIMA, with no reported discontinuations. Grade 3-4 hypertension occurred in 9% of patients receiving ZEJULA vs 2% of patients receiving placebo in NOVA, with discontinuation occurring in &lt;1% of patients. Grade 3-4 hypertension occurred in 5% of ZEJULA-treated patients in QUADRA, with discontinuation occurring in &lt;0.2% of patients. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate at least weekly for the first two months, then monthly for the first year, and periodically thereafter during treatment. Closely monitor patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Manage hypertension with antihypertensive medications and adjustment of the ZEJULA dose, if necessary.

<strong>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity and Lactation</strong>: Based on its mechanism of action, ZEJULA can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after receiving their final dose of ZEJULA. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ZEJULA in breastfed infants, advise lactating women to not breastfeed during treatment with ZEJULA and for 1 month after receiving the final dose.

<strong>Bergen, Norway, 28 April 2020</strong> – BerGenBio ASA (OSE:BGBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, selective AXL kinase inhibitors for unmet medical need, announces that bemcentinib has been selected as the first potential treatment to be fast-tracked in a new UK national multi-centre randomised Phase II clinical trial initiative that aims to save lives and get an early indication of bemcentinib’s effectiveness in treating the most vulnerable patients with COVID-19.

The <strong>AC</strong>celerating <strong>CO</strong>VID-19 <strong>R</strong>esearch &amp; <strong>D</strong>evelopment platform (ACCORD) study is being funded by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). ACCORD brings together a single, UK-wide clinical trial platform provided by the clinical research company IQVIA and the UK’s leading research expertise through the National Institute for Health Research, to rapidly test potential drugs through early stage clinical trials and feed them into the UK’s large-scale COVID-19 studies such as the <a href=""https://www.nihr.ac.uk/urgent-public-health-research-studies-for-covid-19/randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery/24513"">RECOVERY trial</a>, currently the world’s largest randomised controlled clinical trial for COVID-19 treatment.

<strong>ACCORD COVID-19 trial</strong>

The ACCORD study is a multicentre, seamless, Phase II adaptive randomisation platform trial to assess the efficacy and safety of multiple candidate agents, the first of which is bemcentinib, for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalised UK NHS patients.

The study, with drug material and trial resources provided by BerGenBio, will rapidly commence testing in 120 subjects (60 hospitalised COVID-19 patients and 60 control group patients receiving standard of care treatment) across 6 UK NHS hospital trusts, with the first patients due to be treated imminently. BerGenBio anticipates that top line data will readout within a few months. Data will be open source and freely available to enable global knowledge sharing and collaboration. If positive results are seen, bemcentinib will advance rapidly into the large-scale Phase III trials currently in progress across the UK.

<strong>Bemcentinib’s applicability to treat COVID-19</strong>

COVID-19 is the clinical disease manifested as a result of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Preclinical data suggest that bemcentinib is potentially useful for the treatment of early SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are currently no approved medical treatments for, or vaccines against, COVID-19.

Bemcentinib is a once-a-day, oral, highly selective and potent inhibitor of AXL kinase being developed by BerGenBio. Bemcentinib has previously demonstrated a key role in cancer treatment: preventing immune evasion, drug resistance and metastasis in a variety of cancer trials. The drug has to date been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in hundreds of patients and in many cases taken daily for several years.

Bemcentinib has previously been reported to exhibit potent anti-viral activity in preclinical models against several enveloped viruses, including Ebola and Zika virus. Recent data have expanded this to SARS-CoV-2.<sup>1, 2</sup>

Bemcentinib selectively inhibits AXL kinase activity, blocking viral entry and enhancing the anti-viral type I interferon response, a key cellular defence mechanism against viral infection.

<strong>Richard Godfrey, Chief Executive Officer of BerGenBio, commented: </strong><em>“We are delighted to be part of this initiative which is a ground-breaking partnership between government, academia and industry.  We are hopeful that bemcentinib can play a significant role in the global effort to find suitable treatment options for COVID-19 patients, which has had such serious implications for so many people and thereby ease pressures on hospital intensive care units, and ultimately treat thousands of patients. We are poised to commence dosing in the coming days and will provide results as soon as is practically possible.”</em>

<strong>Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, said:</strong><em>“Currently no drugs in the world have been clinically proven to treat Covid-19. But our Therapeutics Taskforce has identified a number of promising candidates. Currently, six different treatments have been entered into national clinical trials and the first is ready to enter the next stage: a new early phase clinical trial platform that we are launching today. This is a national effort made possible by government, academia and industry working together.”</em>

<strong>Professor Tom Wilkinson, ACCORD clinical academic lead based at the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, said: </strong><em>“There has been a tremendous effort to pull this initiative together so rapidly. ACCORD is a national effort and will be key to developing effective new treatments which are needed so desperately. The ACCORD platform will be able to rapidly test potential new treatments, advancing the most promising through Phase 2 clinical trials into the NHS. This unique national platform for developing new COVID-19 drug candidates will access the world-class expertise and resources of the NIHR Respiratory Translational Research Collaboration and allied centres nationwide.”</em>

ACCORD is part of a co-ordinated therapeutic development pathway that the Government has put in place, overseen by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and delivered by UKRI, as part of the overall Therapeutics Taskforce.

(NASDAQ:<a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=RMTI&amp;exchange=2"">RMTI</a>) (“Rockwell Medical” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming anemia management and improving outcomes for patients around the world, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has approved its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for its intravenous formulation of Triferic, Triferic AVNU. With this approval, Triferic AVNU joins Triferic Dialysate as the only FDA-approved products indicated to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in adult patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Triferic is a novel, physiologic iron maintenance therapy that provides bioavailable iron to replace iron lost during every dialysis treatment and maintain hemoglobin. While Triferic Dialysate is designed to be administered via liquid bicarbonate, Triferic AVNU is designed for direct intravenous infusion, which provides hemodialysis patients with greater access to the Triferic platform and expands administration options for clinicians. Triferic AVNU can be administered regardless of a dialysis center’s mode of bicarbonate delivery. Many dialysis centers in international markets and an increasing number of dialysis centers in the U.S. have converted to the use of dry bicarbonate cartridges or bags and on-line dialysate generation, which is not compatible with Triferic Dialysate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">“The approval of Triferic AVNU is a major milestone as we further progress toward our goal of transforming anemia management across the globe. With Triferic AVNU, more adult hemodialysis patients in the U.S will have access to the benefits of this unique therapeutic, regardless of the way their clinic generates bicarbonate. Clinicians will now have the added flexibility to administer Triferic intravenously to a broader group of patients who can benefit from physiologic iron maintenance therapy to manage their anemia,” stated Stuart Paul, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell Medical.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">“Clinical trials have demonstrated that patients treated with Triferic receive steady and consistent bioavailable iron to replace the iron that is lost at every dialysis treatment and hemoglobin is maintained. Now, even in clinics where delivering Triferic through the dialysate is not operationally possible, Triferic AVNU is an option. This may be especially important for patients who are difficult to manage, or for other special patient populations,” added Dr. Steven Fishbane, Chief of Nephrology of Northwell Health and Professor of Medicine at the Zucker School of Medicine.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Over the next several months, the Company plans to initiate a commercial strategy that leverages the experience gained from the 2019 launch of Triferic Dialysate and lays the groundwork for the commercial introduction of Triferic AVNU. The Company expects to launch Evaluation Programs during the third quarter of 2020 to allow clinics to gain direct experience with Triferic AVNU, and the Company expects Triferic AVNU to be available commercially following the completion of the initial Evaluation Programs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify""><strong>About Rockwell Medical</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Rockwell Medical is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming anemia management in a wide variety of therapeutic areas and across the globe, improving the lives of very sick patients. The Company’s initial focus is the treatment of anemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Rockwell Medical's exclusive renal drug therapy, Triferic (ferric pyrophosphate citrate), is the only FDA-approved therapeutic indicated for iron replacement and maintenance of hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients. Rockwell Medical is also an established manufacturer, supplier and leader in delivering high-quality hemodialysis concentrates/dialysates to dialysis providers and distributors in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify""><strong>About Triferic</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Triferic is the only FDA-approved therapy in the U.S. indicated to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients during each dialysis treatment. Triferic has a unique and differentiated mechanism of action which has the potential to benefit patients and health care economics. Triferic represents a potential innovative medical advancement in hemodialysis patient iron management– with the potential to become the future standard of care. The Company has two FDA-approved formulations of Triferic (1) Triferic Dialysate and (2) Triferic AVNU.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Triferic delivers between 5-7 mg iron with every hemodialysis treatment to the bone marrow and maintains hemoglobin without increasing iron stores (ferritin). Triferic donates iron immediately and completely to transferrin (carrier of iron in the body) upon entry into the blood and is then transported directly to the bone marrow to be incorporated into hemoglobin, with no increase in ferritin (stored iron and inflammation) and no reports of anaphylaxis in over 1,000,000 patient administrations, addressing a significant medical need in overcoming Functional Iron Deficiency (FID) in ESRD patients.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify""><strong>Important Safety Information</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions, some of which have been life-threatening and fatal, have been reported in patients receiving parenteral iron products. Patients may present with shock, clinically significant hypotension, loss of consciousness, and/or collapse. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after hemodialysis until clinically stable. Personnel and therapies should be immediately available for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in 1 (0.3%) of 292 patients receiving Triferic in two randomized clinical trials.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">Iron status should be determined on pre-dialysis blood samples. Post dialysis serum iron parameters may overestimate serum iron and transferrin saturation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">The most common adverse reactions (=3% and at least 1% greater than placebo) in controlled clinical studies include: procedural hypotension (21.6%), muscle spasms (9.6%), headache (9.2%), pain in extremity (6.8%), peripheral edema (6.8%), dyspnea (5.8%), back pain (4.5%), pyrexia (4.5%), urinary tract infection (4.5%), asthenia (4.1%), fatigue (3.8%), arteriovenous (AV) fistula thrombosis (3.4%), and AV fistula site hemorrhage (3.4%).</p>

<strong><em>Phase</em></strong> <strong><em>2 vaccine candidate, VLA15, is being evaluated for adult and pediatric indications in North America and Europe.</em></strong>

<strong>Saint</strong> <strong>Herblain</strong> <strong>(France)</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>New</strong> <strong>York,</strong> <strong>NY, April 30, 2020 </strong>– Valneva SE (“Valneva”), a specialty vaccine company, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced a collaboration to develop and commercialize Valneva’s Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15, which is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies.

VLA15 is the only active Lyme disease vaccine program in clinical development today, and covers six serotypes that are prevalent in North America and Europe. The investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine, VLA15, targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia, an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. VLA15 has demonstrated strong immunogenicity and safety data in pre-clinical and Phase 1 studies. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2017<sup>1</sup>. Valneva has completed patient enrolment and follow-up for two Phase 2 studies of its Lyme disease vaccine candidate, in more than 800 people. Valneva expects to report the first Phase 2 results in mid-2020.

Valneva and Pfizer will work closely together throughout the development of VLA15. Valneva is eligible to receive a total of $308 million cash payments consisting of a $130 million upfront payment, $35 million in development milestones and $143 million in early commercialization milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, Valneva will fund 30% of all development costs through completion of the development program, and in return Pfizer will pay Valneva tiered royalties starting at 19%. Pfizer will lead late-stage development and have sole control over commercialization.

<strong>Thomas</strong> <strong>Lingelbach,</strong> <strong>Chief</strong> <strong>Executive</strong> <strong>Officer,</strong> <strong>Valneva</strong>, commented “This collaboration is extremely exciting as it provides the opportunity for the rapid development and launch of a vaccine that has the potential to address a major unmet medical need. It validates Valneva’s strong vaccine R&amp;D capabilities. We believe that

Pfizer is the best partner for our Lyme disease vaccine given their outstanding development and commercial capabilities. Our team is thrilled about the prospect of working with such a successful partner<em>.</em>”

“Lyme disease is the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in the United States and is growing in its prevalence and geographic reach. We look forward to working closely with Valneva to continue advancing the VLA15 program and potentially bring a new solution to patients for this significant unmet need,” said <strong>Nanette</strong> <strong>Cocero,</strong> <strong>Global</strong> <strong>President,</strong> <strong>Pfizer</strong><strong> Vaccines</strong>. “As both a research company, and a manufacturer of pediatric and adult vaccines including a vaccine for tick-borne encephalitis in Europe, we believe that Pfizer’s vaccine heritage, scientific expertise, and global commercial capabilities will help allow the VLA15 program to reach its maximum potential in helping protect children and adults from Lyme disease.”

This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and clearances under antitrust law, including the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

Lazard served as exclusive financial advisor to Valneva and Dechert LLP served as Valneva’s legal counsel for the collaboration.

<strong>About Lyme Disease</strong>

Lyme disease is a systemic infection caused by <em>Borrelia </em>bacteria transmitted to humans by infected <em>Ixodes </em>ticks<sup>2</sup>. It is considered the most common vector borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 300,000 Americans<sup>3</sup> are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year with at least a further 200,000 cases in Europe<sup>4</sup>. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called <em>Erythema migrans </em>or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue, fever, headache, mild stiff neck, arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated, the disease  can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis),  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system. The medical need for vaccination against  Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the disease footprint widens<sup>5</sup>.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; BASEL, Switzerland--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, and Lonza Ltd. (SIX: LONN) today announced a 10-year strategic collaboration agreement to enable larger scale manufacture of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273) against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and additional Moderna products in the future.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">Moderna and Lonza announce worldwide strategic collaboration to manufacture Moderna’s vaccine (mRNA-1273) against novel coronavirus</p>

<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200430006085/en/Moderna-Lonza-Announce-Worldwide-Strategic-Collaboration-Manufacture/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-RLXHJgazfQJNuOVHefdHP-D8R-QU5o2AvY8bhI9uvWSD8DYIYv4TIC1g1u0AKcacnnViVjtb72bOP4-4nHK5ieT3WxPE8m_kWI77F87CseT#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
Under the terms of the agreement, the companies plan to establish manufacturing suites at Lonza’s facilities in the United States and Switzerland for the manufacture of mRNA-1273 at both sites. Technology transfer is expected to begin in June 2020, and the companies intend to manufacture the first batches of mRNA-1273 at Lonza U.S. in July 2020. Over time, the parties intend to establish additional production suites across Lonza’s worldwide facilities, ultimately allowing for the manufacture of material equivalent to up to 1 billion doses of mRNA-1273 per year for use worldwide assuming the currently expected dose of 50 µg. The manufacturing facilities at Lonza complement Moderna’s ongoing U.S. manufacturing efforts, which continue to ramp up to prepare for the further clinical development and commercialization of mRNA-1273.

A portion of the funding for the establishment of manufacturing operations at Lonza U.S. is covered by Moderna’s contract with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which was announced April 16, 2020. BARDA will support late-stage clinical development programs of mRNA-1273. Lonza’s experience in scaling manufacturing of innovative medicines, including support for more than 50 commercial approvals across regulatory jurisdictions, will support Moderna for global supply.

“We are very pleased to partner with Lonza, which shares our commitment to rapidly addressing this pandemic which has created a global health crisis,” said Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer. “This long-term strategic collaboration agreement will enable Moderna to accelerate, by 10-times, our manufacturing capacity for mRNA-1273 and additional products in Moderna’s large clinical portfolio. Lonza’s global presence and expertise are critical as we scale at unprecedented speed. Our common goal is to potentially enable manufacturing of up to 1 billion doses of mRNA-1273.”

“Moderna’s technology represents a significant opportunity to change the way we protect people against disease,” said Albert M. Baehny, Lonza’s Chairman and CEO <i>ad interim</i>. “The current pandemic illustrates the need to combine the best science with resilient supply chains that can scale. We are fully committed to leveraging our global network and experience in manufacturing technologies to support Moderna’s manufacture of mRNA-1273 as well as collaborating on future Moderna products.”

On April 27, 2020, Moderna <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.modernatx.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fmoderna-announces-ind-submitted-us-fda-phase-2-study-mrna&amp;esheet=52213198&amp;newsitemid=20200430006085&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8c726cdeb7189516d1fabba6635b38fc"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">announced</a> that it submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Phase 2 and late stage studies of mRNA-1273 if supported by safety data from the Phase 1 study. Moderna has received initial feedback from the FDA on the design of the planned Phase 2 study, which is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2020. This study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two vaccinations of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart. Each subject will be assigned to receive placebo, a 50 µg or a 250 µg dose at both vaccinations. The company intends to enroll 600 healthy participants across two cohorts of adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300). Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination.

<b>About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality</b>

Moderna scientists designed the company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. More than 1,400 participants have been enrolled in Moderna’s infectious disease vaccine clinical studies under health authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across Phase 1 studies, the company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.modernatx.com%2Fprogram-detail&amp;esheet=52213198&amp;newsitemid=20200430006085&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=nine+development+candidates&amp;index=5&amp;md5=54cb12c03be527c3d39a6ee86f7f03b1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">nine development candidates</a> in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

<strong>Basel, May 1, 2020</strong> — Novartis today announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Enerzair<sup>®</sup>Breezhaler<sup>®</sup> (QVM149; indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate [IND/GLY/MF]) as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA) and a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. If approved, this will be the first once-daily LABA/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/ICS fixed-dose combination for these patients. The European Commission (EC) reviews the CHMP recommendation and usually delivers its final decision in approximately two months.

“This is an important development for patients with uncontrolled asthma because IND/GLY/MF has been shown to improve lung function and symptoms versus a LABA/ICS standard-of-care,” said Professor Huib Kerstjens, Head, Department of Pulmonology at the University Medical Center Groningen. “In secondary analyses of the Phase III IRIDIUM study statistically significant reductions in moderate-to-severe and severe asthma exacerbation rates were observed with high-dose IND/GLY/MF compared to high-dose salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate.”

IND/GLY/MF will be administered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler<sup>® </sup>device, which enables once-daily inhalation using a single inhaler. If approved, IND/GLY/MF will be the first asthma treatment in the EU that can be prescribed together with a digital companion; a Propeller Health sensor and app custom-built for the Breezhaler<sup>® </sup>device. This companion will provide patients with inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data that can be shared with their physician in order to help them make better therapeutic decisions.

“Today’s news is a key milestone in our journey to reimagine asthma care by bringing innovative medicines and a digital companion to patients with uncontrolled asthma,” said Linda Armstrong, MD, Respiratory Development Unit Head, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Once-daily IND/GLY/MF has the potential to improve asthma control for patients whose lives are still impacted by their disease, despite existing inhaled therapies. Additionally, we are pleased to bring an innovative sensor and app companion supplied with IND/GLY/MF to patients to help support enhanced adherence.”

The CHMP recommendation is based on robust efficacy and safety data from over 3,000 patients with asthma from the Phase III IRIDIUM study, in which IND/GLY/MF demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lung function compared with indacaterol acetate/mometasone furoate (IND/MF).<sup>1</sup>

In the IRIDIUM study, the key secondary endpoint was improvement in Asthma Control Questionnaire score (ACQ-7) for IND/GLY/MF versus IND/MF. Both treatments delivered clinically meaningful improvements in this measure of symptoms from baseline at Week 26, but the key secondary endpoint was not met. Among other secondary analyses, IRIDIUM explored asthma exacerbation rates, where statistically significant reductions were observed in moderate-to-severe and severe asthma exacerbation rates with IND/GLY/MF compared with an established LABA/ICS standard-of-care (twice-daily salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate). Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profiles of the monocomponents.<sup>1</sup>

Last month the CHMP also recommended the approval of Atectura<sup>®</sup>Breezhaler<sup>®</sup> (IND/MF) as a maintenance treatment of asthma for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled short-acting beta-agonists<sub>.</sub><sup>2</sup> Novartis is committed to bringing IND/GLY/MF and IND/MF to patients, with additional regulatory filings currently underway in multiple countries, including Switzerland, Japan and Canada.

In keeping with the Novartis commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our asthma combinations, IND/GLY/MF and IND/MF will both be available in the Breezhaler<sup>®</sup> device which is hydrofluoroalkane/chlorofluorocarbon (HFA/CFC)-free.

<strong>About Uncontrolled Asthma </strong>
Asthma affects an estimated 358 million people worldwide and can cause a significant personal, health and financial burden when not adequately controlled.<sup>3,4</sup> Despite current therapy, over 40% of patients with asthma at Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 3, and over 45% at GINA Steps 4 and 5 remain uncontrolled.<sup>5,6</sup> Patients with uncontrolled asthma may downplay or underestimate the severity of their disease and are at a higher risk of exacerbation, hospitalization or death.<sup>7,8,9</sup> Barriers, such as treatment mismatch, safety issues with an oral corticosteroid and ineligibility for biologics, have created an unmet medical need in asthma.<sup>10,11</sup>

<strong>About Enerzair<sup>®</sup> Breezhaler<sup>®</sup></strong>
Enerzair<sup>®</sup> Breezhaler<sup>® </sup>(QVM149; IND/GLY/MF) is intended as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist and a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. This formulation combines the bronchodilation of indacaterol acetate (a LABA) and the antimuscarinic effects of glycopyrronium bromide (a LAMA) with mometasone furoate (high-dose ICS) in a precise once-daily formulation, delivered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler<sup>®</sup> device. Glycopyrronium bromide certain use and formulation intellectual property were exclusively licensed to Novartis in April 2005 by Sosei Heptares and Vectura. Mometasone furoate is exclusively licensed to Novartis from a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, for use in IND/GLY/MF (worldwide excluding the U.S.).

The sensor for the Breezhaler<sup>®</sup> device was developed by Propeller Health and is a CE marked Medical Device, designed and licensed to Novartis exclusively for use with the Breezhaler<sup>®</sup> inhaler worldwide. The sensor includes a microchip, a microphone, Bluetooth capabilities, an antenna and a battery. The sensor does not alter the drug delivery characteristics of the Breezhaler<sup>®</sup>inhaler itself but produces a recording of each administered dose. Based on the patient’s recorded medication usage, personalized content is presented within the app to help the patient better self-manage their asthma.

<strong>About Atectura</strong><sup>®</sup><strong> Breezhaler</strong><sup>® </sup>
Atectura<sup>® </sup>Breezhaler<sup>®</sup> (QMF149; IND/MF) is the combination of indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate intended as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older not adequately controlled with ICS and inhaled short-acting beta-agonists. IND/MF combines the bronchodilation of indacaterol acetate (a LABA) with the anti-inflammatory mometasone furoate (an ICS) in a precise once-daily formulation, delivered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler<sup>® </sup>device. Mometasone furoate is exclusively licensed to Novartis from a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, for use in IND/MF.

<strong>About the PLATINUM Clinical Development Program</strong>
The PLATINUM program, containing over 7,500 patients worldwide, is the Novartis Phase III clinical development program supporting the development of IND/GLY/MF and IND/MF. It includes four studies: the QUARTZ study, which compared a low-dose of IND/MF with MF alone; the PALLADIUM study, which compared IND/MF with MF and salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu); the IRIDIUM study, which compared IND/GLY/MF with IND/MF and Sal/Flu; and the ARGON study, which compared IND/GLY/MF with a combination of Sal/Flu and tiotropium.

<strong>About the IRIDIUM study</strong> <sup>1,12 </sup>
IRIDIUM was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of IND/GLY/MF with IND/MF in patients with asthma.

The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of IND/GLY/MF (High: 150/50/160 µg and Medium:150/50/80 µg), versus two respective IND/MF doses (High: 150/320 µg and Medium: 150/160 µg) in patients with uncontrolled asthma, as determined by pulmonary function testing and effects on asthma control.

All patients were required to be symptomatic at screening despite being on treatment with medium or high stable doses of LABA/ICS. Approximately 3,092 male and female adult patients with asthma were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 (approximately 618 patients in each of the treatment groups) to receive either:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>IND/GLY/MF 150/50/80 µg (once-daily)</li>
 	<li>IND/GLY/MF 150/50/160 µg (once-daily)</li>
 	<li>IND/MF 150/160 µg (once-daily)</li>
 	<li>IND/MF 150/320 µg (once-daily)</li>
 	<li>Sal/Flu 50/500 µg (twice-daily, via Accuhaler<sup>®</sup>)</li>
</ul>
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate superiority of both high-dose IND/GLY/MF versus high-dose IND/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF versus medium-dose IND/MF, all delivered once-daily, in improving trough FEV<sub>1</sub> (volume of air that can be forced out in the first second of expiration approximately 24 hours post-administration of study drug) after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma.

The key secondary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of both doses of IND/GLY/MF  versus respective doses of IND/MF, in improving Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma.

Other secondary analyses also included reduction of exacerbation rate, comparing high-dose IND/GLY/MF with high-dose IND/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF with medium-dose IND/MF. Secondary analyses included efficacy comparisons for both doses of IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu (50/500 µg).

The study showed that IND/GLY/MF was superior to IND/MF in improving trough FEV<sub>1</sub> after 26 weeks, meeting the primary endpoint. The key secondary endpoint, improvement in ACQ-7 score for IND/GLY/MF versus IND/MF was not met but tested treatments showed clinically meaningful improvements in this measure of symptoms from baseline at Week 26. Among other secondary analyses, a substantial reduction was observed in moderate-to-severe and severe asthma exacerbation rates with IND/GLY/MF compared with twice-daily Sal/Flu (50/500 µg).

IND/GLY/MF was generally well tolerated, and safety was comparable across treatment arms.

Full information on all of the endpoints measured in the study can be accessed at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02571777).

<strong>About the PALLADIUM study</strong><sup>13</sup>
PALLADIUM (NCT02554786) was a multicenter, randomized, 52-week treatment, double-blind, triple-dummy, parallel-group study, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of IND/MF compared with MF alone in patients with asthma.

PALLADIUM included 2,216 male and female patients (including 107 adolescents, aged =12 to &lt;18 years old) with medium or high-dose ICS or low-dose ICS/LABA use 3 months prior to screening, a pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> of =50% and less than 80% of the predicted normal value for the patient and an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score of greater than 1.5.

Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive either high-dose IND/MF (150/320 µg) once-daily delivered via Breezhaler<sup>®</sup> (n=445); medium-dose IND/MF (150/160 µg) once-daily delivered via Breezhaler<sup>®</sup> (n=439); MF 400 µg once-daily delivered via Twisthaler<sup>®</sup> (n=444); MF 800 µg administered as 400 µg twice-daily delivered via Twisthaler<sup>®</sup> (n=442); or salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu) 50/500 µg twice-daily delivered via Accuhaler<sup>® </sup>(n=446).

The study showed that medium and high doses of IND/MF demonstrated significant improvements compared with MF in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at Week 26 (Medium: 0.211 L; p&lt;0.001) (High: 0.132 L; p&lt;0.001). The key secondary endpoint of improvement in ACQ-7 at Week 26 was also met for combined doses of IND/MF compared with combined doses of MF (-0.209; p&lt;0.001). These positive results were also observed at Week 52.

Analyses of other lung function endpoints showed greater improvements for IND/MF compared with MF in both morning and evening Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF). Reductions in daily rescue medication use and exacerbation rates were also observed. Patients demonstrated a 12% increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> and 200 mL within 30 minutes following administration of 400 µg salbutamol/360 µg albuterol (or equivalent dose) at the first visit or from historical data.

In the secondary analyses of comparison to Sal/Flu, high-dose IND/MF showed improvements in trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>(0.048 L; p=0.040) at 52 weeks. In asthma control, high-dose IND/MF and Sal/Flu were comparable with a difference in ACQ-7 score of 0.010 (p=0.824). Improvements were observed in both morning and evening PEF (Morning: 13.8 L/min; p&lt;0.001) (Evening: 9.1 L/min; p=0.002), and percentage of rescue medication free days over 52 weeks (4.3; p=0.034) in patients treated with high-dose IND/MF versus Sal/Flu. High-dose IND/MF also showed faster onset of action over Sal/Flu as demonstrated by FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement at 5 minutes on Day 1 (0.055 L; p&lt;0.001).

IND/MF was generally well tolerated, and safety was comparable across treatment arms.

<strong>About the QUARTZ study</strong><sup>14</sup>
The QUARTZ Study (NCT02892344) was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, 12-week treatment, double-blind study, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of IND/MF (150/80µg) compared with MF (200 µg) delivered via the Twisthaler<sup>®</sup> device in adult and adolescent patients with asthma.

All patients were required to be on a stable low dose of ICS (with or without LABA) for at least one month prior to entering the run-in period. During the run-in period, all patients received open-label fluticasone propionate 100 µg twice-daily delivered via Accuhaler<sup>®</sup>. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria at the end of the run-in period were equally randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment groups IND/MF 150/80 µg once-daily delivered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler<sup>®</sup> device, or MF 200 µg once-daily, delivered via Twisthaler<sup>®</sup>.

802 male and female patients (including 64 adolescents, aged = 12 to &lt; 18 years old) were randomized to receive IND/MF (n=398) or MF (n=404). The mean age was 45.6 years with a mean asthma duration of 14.0 years.

Mean pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> (% predicted of normal) was 75.1% at baseline and the mean FEV<sub>1</sub> reversibility after inhalation of short acting beta agonist was 20.7%. The majority of patients were treated with low-dose ICS (42.9%) or low-dose LABA/ICS (56.0%) prior to the study.

Spirometry was performed at the end of the treatment period. The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of IND/MF 150/80 µg once-daily (in the evening) compared with MF 200 µg once-daily in terms of trough FEV<sub>1</sub>after 12 weeks of treatment in adults and adolescents. The key secondary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of IND/MF 150/80 µg to MF 200 µg (once-daily) in terms of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) after 12 weeks of treatment.

IND/MF demonstrated statistically significant improvements in trough FEV<sub>1</sub>compared with MF after 12 weeks of treatment in adult and adolescent patients with inadequately controlled asthma (least squares [LS] mean treatment difference: 0.182 L, 95% CI: 0.148, 0.217; p&lt;0.001). In addition, clinically meaningful lung function benefit for IND/MF was supported by improvements in evening PEF of 26.1 L/min compared with MF alone (95% CI, 21.0, 31.2).

IND/MF also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in asthma control compared with MF, as measured by ACQ-7 after 12 weeks of treatment (LS mean treatment difference: -0.218, 95% CI: -0.293, -0.143; p&lt;0.001). In addition, a clinically meaningful improvement in ACQ-7 was supported by a responder analysis, in which the IND/MF group had a greater proportion of responders (improvement in ACQ-7 &gt;=0.5) compared with the MF group (74.7% vs 64.9%, respectively (odd ratio: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.33).

IND//MF was generally well tolerated, and safety was comparable across treatment arms.

<strong>About the ARGON study</strong><sup>15</sup>
ARGON (NCT03158311) is a Phase IIIb, multicenter, randomized, 24-week, parallel-group, non-inferiority, open-label (blinded for the two IND/GLY/MF tested strengths), active-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of IND/GLY/MF with a free combination of salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu) plus tiotropium in patients with uncontrolled asthma. The ARGON study has completed in the field and its Clinical Study Report is currently being finalized.

The purpose of this trial was to demonstrate that the efficacy of two strengths of the fixed-dose combination product IND/GLY/MF (High: 150/50/160 µg and Medium: 150/50/80 µg) is non-inferior to the efficacy of the free combination of Sal/Flu (50/500 µg) plus tiotropium (5 µg) in patients with uncontrolled asthma.

All patients were symptomatic at screening despite treatment with medium or high stable doses of LABA/ICS as defined by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score = 1.5.

Approximately 1,251 male and female patients with uncontrolled asthma (aged 18 and above) were randomized 1:1:1 (approximately 417 patients in each of the treatment groups) to receive either:
<ul>
 	<li>IND/GLY/MF 150/50/80 µg (once-daily)</li>
 	<li>IND/GLY/MF 150/50/160 µg (once-daily)</li>
 	<li>Open label Sal/Flu 50/500 µg (twice-daily) delivered via Diskus<sup>®</sup> plus tiotropium delivered via Respimat<sup>®</sup></li>
</ul>
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of both high-dose IND/GLY/MF and low-dose IND/GLY/MF to comparator Sal/Flu plus tiotropium after 24 weeks of treatment based on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire.

Secondary objectives included:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus tiotropium based on trough FEV<sub>1</sub> after 24 weeks of treatment</li>
 	<li>To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus tiotropium based on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire over 24 weeks of treatment.</li>
 	<li>To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus tiotropium based on ACQ-7 over 24 weeks of treatment.</li>
 	<li>To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus tiotropium based on lung function over 24 weeks of treatment.</li>

Aravive's lead product candidate, AVB-500, is an ultra-high affinity decoy protein that targets the GAS6-AXL signaling pathway. By capturing serum GAS6, AVB-500 starves the AXL pathway of its signal, potentially halting the biological programming that promotes disease progression. AXL receptor signaling plays an important role in multiple types of malignancies by promoting metastasis, cancer cell survival, resistance to treatments, and immune suppression. The GAS6-AXL signaling pathway also plays a significant role in fibrogenesis. Aravive is evaluating AVB-500 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and kidney fibrosis and intends to expand development into additional oncology and fibrotic indications. Aravive is based in <span class=""xn-location"">Houston, Texas</span> and received a Product Development Award from the Cancer Prevention &amp; Research Institute of <span class=""xn-location"">Texas</span> (CPRIT) in 2016.

Given the severity of illness of patients appropriate for remdesivir treatment and the limited availability of drug supply, hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority in the distribution of remdesivir. Gilead is working with the U.S. government on the logistics of remdesivir distribution and will provide more information when the company begins shipping the drug under the EUA.</p>

We are working to meet the needs of patients, their families and healthcare workers around the world with the greatest sense of urgency and responsibility.”</p>

The optimal dosing and duration of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 is still unknown. Under this EUA, the 10-day dosing duration is suggested for patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the 5-day dosing duration is suggested for patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO. If a patient on the 5-day dosing duration does not demonstrate clinical improvement after five days, treatment may be extended for up to five additional days (10 days total).</p>

Assuming a 10-day treatment course, Gilead’s donation of 1.5 million individual doses of remdesivir equates to more than 140,000 treatment courses that will be provided at no cost to treat patients following potential emergency authorizations and regulatory approvals, including this EUA. Gilead will continue to support clinical trials, and expanded access and compassionate use programs for remdesivir. In addition, Gilead will evaluate global allocation of supply on an ongoing basis using multiple, independent data sources to track the incidence and severity of the outbreak.</p>

The company has invested significant capital, at risk, to meet the supply needs for clinical trials and emergency treatment programs, and to prepare for even greater demand following regulatory authorizations, should these occur.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px;font-size: 1.125rem;font-family: proxima-nova, sans-serif;line-height: 26px;color: #212529;background-color: #ffffff"">Through process refinements, Gilead has substantially shortened the manufacturing lead time from raw materials through to finished product. Gilead has also supplemented internal manufacturing with significant additional capacity from multiple partners in North America, Europe and Asia. The company has set a goal of producing at least 500,000 treatment courses by October, 1 million treatment courses by December 2020 and millions more in 2021, if required. These goals were based on a 10-day treatment course. Gilead now anticipates being able to cover significantly more patients based on the SIMPLE study results, which demonstrated similar efficacy with 5-day and 10-day dosing durations in patients with severe disease. Looking ahead, Gilead is building a geographically diverse consortium of leading pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing companies to help reach and exceed manufacturing goals, and go above and beyond what any company could do individually.

Remdesivir is an investigational agent that has not been approved by the FDA, and it has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use, including for the treatment of COVID-19. There is the possibility of unfavorable results from ongoing and additional clinical trials involving remdesivir and the possibility that Gilead may be unable to complete one or more of such trials in the currently anticipated timelines or at all. Further, it is possible that Gilead may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of remdesivir or that FDA and other regulatory agencies may not approve remdesivir, and any marketing approvals, if granted, may have significant limitations on its use. As a result, remdesivir may never be successfully commercialized. In addition, Gilead may be unable to sufficiently scale up the production of remdesivir in the currently anticipated timelines, and Gilead may be unable to meet future supply needs. These risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those referred to in the forward-looking statements. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These and other risks are described in detail in Gilead’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

NEWARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 1, 2020-- Revance Therapeutics, Inc.(Nasdaq: RVNC), a biotechnology company focused on innovative aesthetic and therapeutic offerings, including its next-generation neuromodulator product, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (DAXI), today announced that it is continuing discussions with Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ: MYL) regarding whether or not Mylan plans to move forward with the biosimilar to BOTOX® program. As previously disclosed, the expected decision date for Mylan is the later of April 30, 2020 or thirty days from the date that Revance provides Mylan with certain deliverables regarding the program. Revance will issue an update on the path forward for the program once Mylan’s decision has been reached.

Mylan and Revance originally signed a collaboration and license agreement in February 2018 for the development and regulatory approval of a biosimilar to BOTOX®, to be followed with commercialization by Mylan in the U.S., Europe and applicable markets throughout the rest of the world. The agreement included an upfront payment of $25 million to Revance.

In September 2019, the companies amended their agreement to include an additional one-time payment of $5 million to Revance in exchange for an extended decision period for Mylan to agree to move forward with a development program. Since that time, Revance has carried out additional characterization work and analysis for the benefit of the program.

The health ministry is moving to approve the antiviral drug remdesivir to treat domestic coronavirus patients.

The move on Satuday followed U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement the previous day that the Food and Drug Administration had authorized the emergency use of the drug for COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir was originally developed by Gilead Sciences Inc. as an Ebola remedy but failed.
<div class=""teads-adCall""></div>
<div id=""div-gpt-ad-1499653692894-0"" class=""jt_content_ad""></div>
If given the go-ahead, remdesivir would become Japan's first recognized remedy for the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

To greenlight remdesivir, the health ministry will apply a special approval system that allows screening to be substantially shortened on condition that the drug in question has been approved overseas.

On Saturday afternoon, the government, at a round-robin-style Cabinet meeting, revised a related ordinance in such a way to make it possible to apply the special approval system to remdesivir.
<div class=""content-related-stories"">

""I heard that the company will file an application for approval in a few days,"" health minister Katsunobu Kato said. ""I've instructed officials to be prepared to be able to grant an approval in about a week once the application is made.""

</div>
Japan's approval process usually takes about a year based on domestic clinical trials. Expectations are especially high that remdesivir will help severely ill patients.

In late April, the government said remdesivir needs to be introduced for emergency use and that fast-track procedures to greenlight domestic sales were being prepared under the pharmaceuticals and medical devices law.

After receiving the application from Gilead Sciences, the health ministry will collect opinions on safety and other aspects of the drug at a meeting of its Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council.

Remdesivir, which previously failed as a Ebola treatment, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the coronavirus, copy themselves to overwhelm the host's immune system.

According to a recent study published by the New England Journal of Medicine, the drug was effective in nearly 70 percent of 53 coronavirus patients with severe symptoms, but caused serious side effects, including deterioration of kidney and liver functions, in a quarter of them.

The government, however, has not applied the special approval system to the flu drug Avigan, because its sales prospects overseas are unclear. Instead, the government is proceeding with clinical trials.

Avigan is widely viewed as a potential treatment for COVID-19. It was developed by Tokyo-based Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co., an affiliate of Fujifilm Holdings Corp.

The test is designed to help determine if a patient has been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and if the patient has developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Roche has already started shipping the new antibody test to leading laboratories globally and will ramp up production capacity to high double-digit millions per month to serve healthcare systems in countries accepting the CE mark<sup>2</sup> as well as the U.S.

“Thanks to the enormous efforts of our dedicated colleagues we are now able to deliver a high-quality antibody test in high quantities, so we can support healthcare systems around the world with an important tool to better manage the COVID-19 health crisis,” said Severin Schwan, CEO Roche Group. ”I am in particular pleased about the high specificity and sensitivity of our test, which is crucial to support health care systems around the world with a reliable tool to better manage the COVID-19 health crisis.”

“Our best scientists have worked 24/7 over the last few weeks and months to develop a highly reliable antibody test to help fight this pandemic,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Roche is committed to helping laboratories deliver fast, accurate, and reliable results to healthcare professionals and their patients.”

Roche’s SARS-CoV2 antibody test, which has a specificity greater than 99.8% and 100% sensitivity<sup>3</sup> (14 Days post-PCR confirmation), can help assess patients’ immune response to the virus. As more is understood about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the test may help to assess who has built up immunity to the virus.

With extensive global manufacturing capabilities, Roche will be able to deliver high double-digit millions of tests per month. Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers, which are widely available around the world.

For countries with specific regulatory requirements, local approval timelines apply. In addition there may be other country-specific regulations, such as import requirements, which will determine when the test becomes available locally. Roche will work closely with the respective regional representatives to ensure we appropriately support local registration efforts.

<strong>About antibody testing</strong>
An antibody test, also called a serology test, is used to determine whether a person might have gained immunity against a pathogen or not. The human body makes antibodies in response to many illnesses. In the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, antibody tests need to be able to specifically detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to other similar coronaviruses, which could generate a false positive result and thus wrongly indicate potential immunity. A false positive result happens when a person receives a positive test result, when they should have received a negative result. False positives are particularly critical when we do not know how many people in a given population have had COVID-19. As of 24 April 2020, no study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans<sup>4</sup>.

<strong>About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology test</strong>
Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the in-vitro qualitative detection of antibodies (including IgG) to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human serum and plasma. Through a blood sample, the test, which is based on an in-solution double-antigen sandwich format, can detect antibodies to the new coronavirus causing COVID-19, which could signal whether a person has already been infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. Based on the measurement of a total of 5272 samples, the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has 99.81% specificity and shows no cross-reactivity to the four human coronaviruses causing common cold. This means it can lower the chance of false positives due to the detection of similar antibodies that may be present in an individual, but are specific for coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2. Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 detected antibodies with 100% sensitivity in samples taken 14 days after a PCR-confirmed infection. The importance of specificity and sensitivity of a particular test will be dependent on its purpose and disease prevalence within a given population.

Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers, which are widely available around the world. These fully automated systems can provide SARS-CoV-2 test results in approximately 18 minutes for one single test, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyser.

</ul>
TRUXIMA is the only biosimilar to the reference product Rituxan<sup>®1</sup> (rituximab) available to treat rheumatoid arthritis in the United States. See important safety information below including Boxed Warning regarding fatal infusion-related reactions, severe mucocutaneous reactions, hepatitis B virus reactivation and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

“We are proud to make TRUXIMA available to patients and providers as a treatment option for these indications, especially as this is the only rituximab biosimilar indicated for rheumatoid arthritis,” said Brendan O’Grady, Executive Vice President, North America Commercial, Teva. “Following the launch of our other biosimilar earlier this year, we remain focused on our commitment to lower healthcare costs and increase price competition through the availability of biosimilars.”

Celltrion Healthcare and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. entered into an exclusive partnership in October 2016 for Teva to commercialize TRUXIMA in the U.S. and Canada. In May 2019, TRUXIMA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to match all of the reference product’s oncology indications described below.

“We are pleased that patients in the United States can now have access to TRUXIMA for these new indications,” said Mr. Hyoung-Ki Kim, Vice Chairman at Celltrion Healthcare. “We believe that the continued use of biosimilars in the U.S. market will contribute to addressing unmet needs for patients and providers.”

Earlier this year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) granted pass-through status for TRUXIMA in the hospital outpatient setting. The Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC or “list price”) for TRUXIMA will be 10 percent lower than the reference product. TRUXIMA is expected to be available through primary wholesalers at a WAC of $845.55 per 100mg vial and $4,227.75 per 500mg vial. Actual costs to individual patients and providers for TRUXIMA are anticipated to be lower than WAC because WAC does not account for additional rebates and discounts that may apply. Savings on out-of-pocket costs may vary depending on the patient’s insurance payer and eligibility for participation in the assistance program.

Teva also offers dedicated patient support services through the CORE program. CORE is available to help eligible patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals navigate the reimbursement process. CORE offers a range of services, including benefits verification and coverage determination, support for precertification and prior authorization, assistance with coverage guidelines and claims investigation, and support through the claims and appeals process. A savings program is also available for eligible commercially insured patients.

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b> - Rituximab products can cause severe, including fatal, infusion-related reactions. Severe reactions typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset of 30-120 minutes. Rituximab product-induced infusion-related reactions and sequelae include urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, anaphylactoid events, or death

Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to dosing. For RA, GPA, and MPA patients, methylprednisolone 100 mg intravenously or its equivalent is recommended 30 minutes prior to each infusion. Institute medical management (e.g. glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, or oxygen) for infusion-related reactions as needed. Depending on the severity of the infusion-related reaction and the required interventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue TRUXIMA. Resume infusion at a minimum 50% reduction in rate after symptoms have resolved. Closely monitor the following patients: those with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions, and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (=25,000/mm3)

<b>Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions</b> - Mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, can occur in patients treated with rituximab products. These reactions include paraneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The onset of these reactions has been variable and includes reports with onset on the first day of rituximab exposure. Discontinue TRUXIMA in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction. The safety of re-administration of rituximab products to patients with severe mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined

<b>Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation</b> - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs classified as CD20-directed cytolytic antibodies, including rituximab products. Cases have been reported in patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and also in patients who are HBsAg negative but are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive. Reactivation also has occurred in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive and hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] positive)

HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA levels or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e., increase in transaminase levels. In severe cases increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur

Screen all patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating treatment with TRUXIMA. For patients who show evidence of prior hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive), consult with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy before and/or during TRUXIMA treatment

Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months following TRUXIMA therapy. HBV reactivation has been reported up to 24 months following completion of rituximab therapy

In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on TRUXIMA, immediately discontinue TRUXIMA and any concomitant chemotherapy, and institute appropriate treatment. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming TRUXIMA treatment in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Resumption of TRUXIMA treatment in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing HBV

<b>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)</b> - JC virus infection resulting in PML and death can occur in rituximab product-treated patients with hematologic malignancies. The majority of patients with hematologic malignancies diagnosed with PML received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of their last infusion of rituximab

Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset neurologic manifestations. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture

Discontinue TRUXIMA and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML

<b>Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) - </b>Acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or hyperphosphatemia from tumor lysis, sometimes fatal, can occur within 12-24 hours after the first infusion of rituximab products in patients with NHL. A high number of circulating malignant cells ( =25,000/mm3) or high tumor burden, confers a greater risk of TLS

Administer aggressive intravenous hydration and anti-hyperuricemic therapy in patients at high risk for TLS. Correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as indicated

<b>Infections </b>- Serious, including fatal, bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and following the completion of rituximab product-based therapy. Infections have been reported in some patients with prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia (defined as hypogammaglobulinemia &gt;11 months after rituximab exposure). New or reactivated viral infections included cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis B and C. Discontinue TRUXIMA for serious infections and institute appropriate anti-infective therapy. TRUXIMA is not recommended for use in patients with severe, active infections

<b>Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions - </b>Cardiac adverse reactions, including ventricular fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock may occur in patients receiving rituximab products. Discontinue infusions for serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Perform cardiac monitoring during and after all infusions of TRUXIMA for patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias, or who have a history of arrhythmia or angina

<b>Renal Toxicity - </b>Severe, including fatal, renal toxicity can occur after rituximab product administration in patients with NHL. Renal toxicity has occurred in patients who experience tumor lysis syndrome and in patients with NHL administered concomitant cisplatin therapy during clinical trials. The combination of cisplatin and TRUXIMA is not an approved<b> </b>treatment regimen. Monitor closely for signs of renal failure and discontinue TRUXIMA in patients with a rising serum creatinine or oliguria

<b>Bowel Obstruction and Perforation - </b>Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some cases leading to death, can occur in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. In postmarketing reports, the mean time to documented gastrointestinal perforation was 6 (range 1-77) days in patients with NHL. Evaluate if symptoms of obstruction such as abdominal pain or repeated vomiting occur

<b>Immunization - </b>The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab product therapy has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment

Prior to initiating TRUXIMA physicians should ensure patients’ vaccinations and immunizations are up-to-date with guidelines. Administration of any non-live vaccines should occur at least 4 weeks prior to a course of TRUXIMA

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity - </b>Based on human data, rituximab products can cause fetal harm due to B-cell lymphocytopenia in infants exposed to rituximab in-utero. Advise pregnant women of the risk to a fetus. Females of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while receiving TRUXIMA and for 12 months following the last dose of TRUXIMA

<b>Concomitant Use With Other Biologic Agents and DMARDS Other Than Methotrexate</b>

Observe patients closely for signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used concomitantly as limited safety data is available<b>.</b>

Use of concomitant immunosuppressants other than corticosteroids has not been studied in GPA or MPA patients exhibiting peripheral B-cell depletion following treatment with rituximab products

<b>Use in RA Patients Who Have Not Had Prior Inadequate Response to TNF Antagonists</b>

TRUXIMA should only be used in patients who have had a prior inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist

<b>Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials of NHL (=25%) </b>were:<b> </b>infusion-related reactions, fever, lymphopenia, chills, infection, and asthenia

<b>Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials of CLL (=25%) </b>were:<b> </b>infusion-related reactions and neutropenia

<b>Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials of RA (=10%) </b>were: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and bronchitis (other important adverse reactions include infusion-related reactions, serious infections, and cardiovascular events)

<b>Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials of GPA and MPA (=15%) </b>were: infections, nausea, diarrhea, headache, muscle spasms, anemia, peripheral edema, and infusion-related reactions

<b>Nursing Mothers</b> - There are no data on the presence of rituximab in human milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Since many drugs including antibodies are present in human milk, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of TRUXIMA due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants

<b>About TRUXIMA<sup>® </sup>
</b>TRUXIMA (rituximab-abbs) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biosimilar to RITUXAN<sup>®</sup> (rituximab) for the treatment of: adult patients with CD20-positive, B-cell NHL to be used as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or CLL in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC); for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in combination with methotrexate in adult patients with moderately-to severely-active RA who have inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies; and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in adult patients in combination with glucocorticoids

TRUXIMA has the same mechanism of action as Rituxan and has demonstrated biosimilarity to Rituxan through a totality of evidence.

SAN FRANCISCO &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY) today announced the selection of a development candidate (DC) for VIR-2703 (also referred to as ALN-COV), an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The companies plan to soon meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities to discuss a potential accelerated path for filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) or IND equivalent application at or around year-end 2020, less than a year since program initiation. The companies plan to advance VIR-2703 as an inhalational formulation for the potential treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“As this pandemic continues to unfold, we are committed to acting with the utmost urgency to broaden and accelerate our efforts to develop investigational RNAi therapeutics against COVID-19, and potentially future coronavirus-mediated diseases.”</p>

In its discovery efforts, Alnylam synthesized over 350 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) – the molecules that mediate RNAi – targeting highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were then analyzed bioinformatically and assessed in <i>in vitro</i> potency assays. Multiple highly potent siRNAs were identified that demonstrated a 3-log reduction of viral replication in an <i>in vitro</i> SARS-CoV-2 live virus model conducted by Vir. In dose-response assays, VIR-2703 was shown to have an effective concentration for 50% inhibition (EC50) of less than 100 picomolar and an EC95 of less than 1 nanomolar in the SARS-CoV-2 live virus model measuring inhibition of infectious virion production. Further, VIR-2703 has predicted reactivity against greater than 99.9 percent of the over 4300 SARS-CoV-2 genomes currently available in public databases that meet analysis requirements, and is also predicted to have reactivity toward the SARS-CoV genome from the 2003 SARS outbreak. With this DC selection, Vir and Alnylam will work closely together to generate the data required to enable rapid commencement of clinical studies.

“Vir is committed to applying industry-leading technologies in our fight against COVID-19. Our fruitful and expansive collaboration with Alnylam has rapidly led to identification of a development candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2,” said George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO of Vir. “With this candidate now in hand, we will further accelerate our efforts and plan to begin studies in humans at or around year-end. Our ultimate goal would be to provide rapid worldwide access, if approved, to an effective therapeutic to combat COVID-19.”

“I’m very proud of the quality and pace of work done by our scientists and with our collaborators at Vir to identify an RNAi therapeutic development candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome. To our knowledge, this is one of the most potent direct-acting antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2 reported to date,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “As this pandemic continues to unfold, we are committed to acting with the utmost urgency to broaden and accelerate our efforts to develop investigational RNAi therapeutics against COVID-19, and potentially future coronavirus-mediated diseases.”

In addition to the development candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the companies will utilize Alnylam’s recent advances in lung delivery of siRNAs, with widespread silencing of gene targets in the respiratory tract in multiple cell types, including cells in the respiratory tract that may be the targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the companies will employ Vir’s infectious disease expertise and established capabilities to bring forward up to three additional host factor-targeting development candidates to treat COVID-19, and potentially other coronavirus diseases.

<b>About VIR-2703 (ALN-COV)</b>

VIR-2703 is an inhaled SARS-CoV-2-targeting siRNA that may have utility for prevention or for treatment. It leverages Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s latest advances in lung delivery of siRNAs and may have applicability to other coronaviruses as well. VIR-2703 is the first development candidate selected in the company’s expanded collaboration with Alnylam for up to four RNAi potential therapeutics for COVID-19.

<b>About RNAi</b>

RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

<strong>HERCULES, Calif.</strong> –Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: BIO and BIOb), a global leader of life science research and clinical diagnostic products, today announced that its SARS-CoV-2 Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) test kit has been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The SARS-CoV-2 Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) test runs on Bio-Rad's QX200 and QXDx ddPCR systems.

The high sensitivity of the test makes it well suited to screening upper respiratory samples in patients with a low viral load, including individuals in the early stages of infection as compared to classical quantitative PCR tests. The test can also play an important role in surveillance by detecting minimal residual disease in people recovering from COVID-19 informing them if they are negative for the virus. Bio-Rad’s single-well SARS CoV-2 ddPCR test provides clinicians with a high degree of sensitivity that can significantly improve the accuracy of reported results.

According to the World Health Organization, regular, accurate testing of COVID-19 is a key component in the fight against the global pandemic.

""We are pleased to receive Emergency Use Authorization for our SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test that offers high sensitivity in detecting infection of COVID-19 at an early stage,"" said Simon May, Senior Vice President of Bio-Rad’s Digital Biology Group. ""We believe the test will be a powerful complement to current diagnostics, helping clinicians and public health officials accurately identify infected individuals in a timely manner. With the EUA, our test is now available to clinical labs in the U.S.,"" he said.

Thousands of hospitals and molecular testing labs in the U.S. and around the world have Bio-Rad’s QX200 and QXDx ddPCR systems installed and have the capacity to perform SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR testing. The SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test represents the latest addition to Bio-Rad’s product offerings related to COVID-19. This is the second EUA Bio-Rad has been granted for COVID-19. Last week, the company received an EUA for a serology test to detect antibodies to the virus.

NEW YORK &amp; MAINZ, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) announced today that the first participants have been dosed in the U.S. in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the BNT162 vaccine program to prevent COVID-19. The trial is part of a global development program, and the dosing of the first cohort in Germany was completed last week.
<p id=""news-body-cta"">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <a class=""ext"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200505005474/en/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200505005474/en/</a></p>
The Phase 1/2 study is designed to determine the safety, immunogenicity and optimal dose level of four mRNA vaccine candidates evaluated in a single, continuous study. The dose level escalation portion (Stage 1) of the Phase 1/2 trial in the U.S. will enroll up to 360 healthy subjects into two age cohorts (18-55 and 65-85 years of age). The first subjects immunized in Stage 1 of the study will be healthy adults 18-55 years of age. Older adults will only be immunized with a given dose level of a vaccine candidate once testing of that candidate and dose level in younger adults has provided initial evidence of safety and immunogenicity. Sites currently dosing participants include NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the University of Maryland School of Medicine, with the University of Rochester Medical Center/Rochester Regional Health and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center to begin enrollment shortly.

“With our unique and robust clinical study program underway, starting in Europe and now the U.S., we look forward to advancing quickly and collaboratively with our partners at BioNTech and regulatory authorities to bring a safe and efficacious vaccine to the patients who need it most. The short, less than four-month timeframe in which we’ve been able to move from pre-clinical studies to human testing is extraordinary and further demonstrates our commitment to dedicating our best-in-class resources, from the lab to manufacturing and beyond, in the battle against COVID-19,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and CEO, Pfizer.

Pfizer and BioNTech’s development program includes four vaccine candidates, each representing a different combination of mRNA format and target antigen. The novel design of the trial allows for the evaluation of the various mRNA candidates simultaneously in order to identify the safest and potentially most efficacious candidate in a greater number of volunteers, in a manner that will facilitate the sharing of data with regulatory authorities in real time.

“It is encouraging that we have been able to leverage more than a decade of experience in developing our mRNA platforms to initiate a global clinical trial in multiple regions for our vaccine program in such a short period. We are optimistic that advancing multiple vaccine candidates into human trials will allow us to identify the safest, most effective vaccination options against COVID-19,” said CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin.

During the clinical development stage, BioNTech will provide clinical supply of the vaccine from its GMP-certified mRNA manufacturing facilities in Europe.

In anticipation of a successful clinical development program, Pfizer and BioNTech are working to scale up production for global supply. Pfizer plans to activate its extensive manufacturing network and invest at risk in an effort to produce an approved COVID-19 vaccine as quickly as possible for those most in need around the world. The breadth of this program should allow production of millions of vaccine doses in 2020, increasing to hundreds of millions in 2021. Pfizer-owned sites in three U.S. states (Massachusetts, Michigan and Missouri) and Puurs, Belgium have been identified as manufacturing centers for COVID-19 vaccine production, with more sites to be selected. Through its existing mRNA production sites in Mainz and Idar-Oberstein, Germany, BioNTech plans to ramp up its production capacity to provide further capacities for a global supply of the potential vaccine.

BioNTech and Pfizer will work jointly to commercialize the vaccine worldwide upon regulatory approval (excluding China, where BioNTech has a collaboration with Fosun Pharma for BNT162 for both clinical development and commercialization).

<b>FT. MYERS, FL / ACCESSWIRE / May 5, 2020 / NeoGenomics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEO)</b>, a leading provider of cancer-focused genetic testing services, today announced a collaboration with Bayer (BAYN) to facilitate an RNA-based Neurotrophic Tropomyosin-Receptor Kinase (NTRK) testing for certain colorectal and thyroid cancer patients. All eligible patients who enroll and opt-in to a Sponsored Testing Program will receive testing at no cost to themselves or their insurance. Bayer will cover the total cost of this test regardless of the results and treatment decision.

The Sponsored Testing Program is for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with high Microsatellite Instability (MSI-H) status or deficient DNA mismatch repair (MMR-), as well as patients with radioactive iodine refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (RAIR DTC). All eligible patients who enroll in the Sponsored Testing Program will receive an RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) test (NTRK NGS Fusion Profile) from NeoGenomics and patients will also receive a NeoGenomics Pan-Tropomyosin receptor kinase (TrK) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) test. For more information onthe Sponsored Testing Program and its no-cost testing, or to download the Test Request Form, healthcare professionals should visit <a href=""https://pr.report/giUBXCPY"">https://www.neogenomics.com/ntrk-sponsored-testing-program</a>.

A higher prevalence of NTRK gene fusions are found among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with prior high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) status. Studies suggest NTRK gene fusions are greater than 3% among these patients. NTRK rearrangements are also found to occur in 2.4-12% of radioactive iodine refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (RAIR DTC) patients with less favorable disease outcomes. Genomic cancer tests that detect an NTRK gene fusion provide actionable information for patients that harbor the genomic alteration and may be appropriate for therapy.

""Our collaboration with Bayer to provide eligible colorectal and thyroid cancer patients with no-cost testing for NTRK gene fusions will help facilitate critical therapy for these patients,"" said Douglas M. VanOort, NeoGenomics' Chairman and CEO. ""As a leading provider of oncology testing for clinical trials and patient care, NeoGenomics is in a unique position to provide access to genomic tests enabling patients to access important therapies without delay. This is one of several initiatives we expect to bring forward in our collaboration with Bayer that offer patients access to innovative testing approaches for approved cancer therapies.""

NeoGenomics has a national footprint and broad customer reach in cancer-related genetic testing services and one of the most comprehensive oncology-focused test menus. NeoGenomics is uniquely positioned to increase patient access to important diagnostic testing that can drive treatment decisions for better patient care.

<b><i>Business Highlights</i></b>

<b><u>Key Pipeline Progress</u></b>

Regeneron has more than 20 product candidates in clinical development, including five marketed products for which it is investigating additional indications. Updates from the clinical pipeline include:

<u>EYLEA</u><sup>®</sup><u> (aflibercept) Injection</u>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>In February 2020, the Company announced positive two-year results from the Phase 3 PANORAMA trial evaluating EYLEA in patients with moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). The two-year data demonstrated that EYLEA reduced the likelihood of developing vision-threatening events by at least 75% in patients with NPDR.</li>
 	<li>In March 2020, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved EYLEA for the treatment of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) in Japan.</li>
</ul>
<u>Dupixent</u><i><sup>®</sup></i><u> (dupilumab)</u>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, with a target action date of May 26, 2020. In addition, a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis has also been submitted in the European Union (EU).</li>
 	<li>In March 2020, the MHLW approved Dupixent for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in Japan.</li>
 	<li>The sBLA for the 300 mg auto-injector is under review by the FDA, with a target action date of June 20, 2020.</li>
</ul>
<u>Oncology Program</u>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>In April 2020, the Company and Sanofi announced that the primary endpoint was met in the Phase 3 trial of Libtayo<sup>® </sup>(cemiplimab) as monotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the trial be stopped early due to highly significant improvement in overall survival. The data from the trial will form the basis of regulatory submissions in the U.S. and EU in the second half of 2020.</li>
 	<li>Patient enrollment in the Libtayo Phase 3 first-line NSCLC chemotherapy combination study is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020.</li>
 	<li>In May 2020, the Company and Sanofi announced that Libtayo demonstrated clinically-meaningful and durable responses in a pivotal, single-arm, open-label trial in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma and plan regulatory submissions in 2020.</li>
 	<li>The Company now has 6 bispecific antibodies in clinical development for various blood cancers and solid tumors. These include multiple classes of bispecifics including CD3 bispecifics, a CD28 costimulatory bispecific, and other classes of bispecifics.</li>
</ul>
<u>Praluent</u><i><sup>®</sup></i><u> (alirocumab)</u>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>In March 2020, the Company announced that the Phase 3 trial in adult patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) met its primary endpoint and plans to submit an sBLA in mid-2020.</li>
</ul>
<u>Evinacumab</u>, an antibody to ANGPTL3
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>In March 2020, the Company presented positive, detailed results from the Phase 3 trial in patients with HoFH. The Company has also initiated a rolling BLA submission for HoFH and plans to submit an MAA in the EU in the second half of 2020.</li>
</ul>
<u>Pozelimab</u>, an antibody to C5
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>A Phase 2 study in the ultra-rare disease CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy was initiated.</li>
</ul>
<u>REGN-EB3</u>, a multi-antibody therapy to Ebola virus infection
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The FDA accepted for priority review the BLA submission for Ebola, with a target action date of October 25, 2020.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>COVID-19 Update</u></b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The Company is advancing REGN-COV2, a novel investigational antibody ""cocktail"" treatment designed to prevent and treat the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In April, Regeneron moved its leading neutralizing antibodies into pre-clinical and clinical-scale cell production lines and plans to begin clinical studies in June 2020. The Company is working to rapidly scale-up manufacturing, with a goal to have hundreds of thousands of preventative doses available by the end of August 2020.</li>
 	<li>In April 2020, the Company provided an update on the adaptively-designed Phase 2/3 U.S. study evaluating Kevzara<i><sup>®</sup></i> (sarilumab) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended continuing the ongoing Phase 3 trial only in the more advanced ""critical"" group with the 400 mg dose of Kevzara and discontinuing the study in the less advanced ""severe"" group, based on initial Phase 2 results.</li>
 	<li>The Company announced an expanded agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to fund certain research and development activities related to COVID-19 treatments, including REGN-COV2 and the U.S. Kevzara study.</li>
 	<li>The Company continues to monitor the potential impact on product sales. For EYLEA in the United States, there was limited impact on net product sales in the first quarter of 2020. In the month of April 2020, overall U.S. EYLEA demand was lower compared to the same period of 2019 with relative improvement seen by the end of the month. The Company expects to see continued adverse impact on new patient starts for all products while social distancing guidelines remain in place.</li>
 	<li>Regeneron maintains adequate market supply for all commercialized products. The Company's raw material supplies and contract manufacturing support have also remained stable. In order to enable the U.S. manufacturing site to produce large-scale quantities of REGN-COV2, the Company is working with the FDA to accelerate licensing of additional commercial products manufactured at its Ireland facility.</li>
 	<li>Regeneron expects fully-recruited clinical studies to remain generally on track. The Company has paused new enrollment in certain studies in light of the pandemic and continues to monitor the evolving situation across global trial sites.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Business Development Update</u></b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The Company and Sanofi entered into an agreement, effective April 1, 2020, to restructure its collaboration for Praluent. In the United States, the Company will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of Praluent and will record net product sales. Sanofi will have sole responsibility for the development and commercialization of Praluent outside the United States, and will pay the Company a 5% royalty on Praluent net product sales.</li>
</ul>
<p id=""indentid"">In December 2019, the Company and Sanofi also announced their intent to restructure their antibody collaboration for Kevzara. The companies continue to assess potential terms of this restructuring in light of the recently launched clinical programs evaluating Kevzara in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>In April 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Zai Lab Limited to develop and commercialize REGN1979 (bispecific antibody targeting CD20 and CD3) in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau. Under the terms of the agreement, Zai is obligated to make a $30 million up-front payment, and we are eligible to receive up to $160 million in additional regulatory and sales milestone payments. The Company will continue to lead global development activities for REGN1979, and Zai will be responsible for funding a portion of the global development costs for certain clinical trials.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>First Quarter 2020 Financial Results</u></b>

Effective January 1, 2020, Regeneron has implemented changes in the presentation of its financial statements related to certain reimbursements and other payments for products developed and commercialized with collaborators. The Company made these changes in presentation to better reflect the nature of the Company's costs incurred and revenues earned pursuant to arrangements with collaborators and to enhance the comparability of Regeneron's financial statements with industry peers. The change in presentation has been applied retrospectively. See Note (4) below for further information.

<b><i>Revenues</i></b>

Total revenues increased by 33% to $1.828 billion in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $1.373 billion in the first quarter of 2019.

EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $1.172 billion in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $1.074 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Overall distributor inventory levels for EYLEA in the United States remained within the Company's one-to-two-week targeted range.

Total revenues also include Sanofi and Bayer collaboration revenues<sup>(2)<b> </b></sup>of $528 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $246 million in the first quarter of 2019. Sanofi collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2020 included the Company's share of profits from collaboration antibodies (Dupixent, Praluent, and Kevzara) of $171 million, while Sanofi collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2019 included the Company's share of losses from collaboration antibodies of ($28) million. The change in the Company's share of profits (losses) from collaboration antibodies was primarily driven by higher Dupixent profits.

Refer to Table 4 for a summary of collaboration revenue.

 	<li>The higher GAAP and non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses in the first quarter of 2020 were principally due to additional costs incurred in connection with our earlier-stage pipeline, higher headcount and headcount-related costs, and an increase in clinical manufacturing activities.</li>
 	<li>The higher GAAP and non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses in the first quarter of 2020 were primarily due to higher headcount and headcount-related costs, an increase in commercialization-related expenses for EYLEA, and higher contributions to independent not-for-profit patient assistance organizations. In addition, GAAP SG&amp;A expenses in the first quarter of 2020 increased partly due to additional accruals for loss contingencies associated with ongoing litigation.</li>
 	<li>The increase in COCM was primarily due to the recognition of manufacturing costs associated with higher sales of Dupixent and manufacturing costs in connection with our BARDA Ebola agreement.</li>
 	<li>Other operating (income) expense, net, includes recognition of a portion of amounts previously deferred in connection with up-front and development milestone payments, as applicable, received in connection with the Company's collaborative arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>Other Financial Information</i></b>

GAAP other (expense) income, net, includes the recognition of net losses on equity securities of $57 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to net gains of $43 million in the first quarter of 2019.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Company's GAAP effective tax rate was 6.6%, compared to 15.6% in the first quarter of 2019. The GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was positively impacted, compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily by stock-based compensation, and, to a lesser extent, income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate and federal tax credits for research activities. In the first quarter of 2020, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.5%, compared to 16.0% in the first quarter of 2019.

GAAP net income per diluted share was $5.43 in the first quarter of 2020, compared to GAAP net income per diluted share of $3.99 in the first quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $6.60 in the first quarter of 2020, compared to non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $4.45 in the first quarter of 2019. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.

During the first quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased 719,167 shares of Common Stock under the Company's share repurchase program and recorded the cost of the shares received, or $273 million, as Treasury Stock. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had $473 million which remained available for share repurchases under the original $1.0 billionprogram.

The Company generated $528 million in free cash flow for the first quarter of 2020, compared to $823 million for the first quarter of 2019.

<td>This press release uses non-GAAP R&amp;D, non-GAAP SG&amp;A, non-GAAP COGS, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, and free cash flow, which are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain non-cash and/or other items from the related GAAP financial measure. The Company also includes a non-GAAP adjustment for the estimated income tax effect of reconciling items.

The Company makes such adjustments for items the Company does not view as useful in evaluating its operating performance. For example, adjustments may be made for items that fluctuate from period to period based on factors that are not within the Company's control (such as the Company's stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued or changes in the fair value of the Company's equity investments) or items that are not associated with normal, recurring operations (such as restructuring-related expenses, including employee separation costs). Management uses these non-GAAP measures for planning, budgeting, forecasting, assessing historical performance, and making financial and operational decisions, and also provides forecasts to investors on this basis. Additionally, such non-GAAP measures provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company's core business operations. However, there are limitations in the use of these and other non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain expenses that are recurring in nature. Furthermore, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Any non-GAAP financial measure presented by Regeneron should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Company's historical GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.</td>

<p align=""justify""><strong>COPENHAGEN, Denmark, May 6, 2020</strong> – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA, OTC: BVNRY) today announced that it has entered into an exclusive head of terms agreement with AdaptVac, a joint venture established by ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies and NextGen Vaccines spun out of the University of Copenhagen, to license AdaptVac’s proprietary capsid virus like particle (VLP) based SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine. The parties seek to enter into the final license agreement within the next two months.</p>
<p align=""justify"">AdaptVac is a member of the international PREVENT-nCoV consortium that includes several European universities and earlier this year received an EU Horizon grant to rapidly advance AdaptVac’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19 into the clinic. The members of the consortium hold preclinical and clinically validated experience from working with similar coronaviruses such as MERS and SARS, as well as malaria vaccines, using AdaptVac’s capsid VLP technology and ExpreS2ion’s ExpreS2 technology. AdaptVac’s technology has the potential to mimic a virus to the body’s immune system, giving the optimal stimulus to generate a fast, long-lasting immune response that offers a highly efficacious protection. Importantly, the production of the vaccine technology can be readily scaled to commercial quantities and AdaptVac is working with AGC Biologics for the manufacture and scale-up of the vaccine. Bavarian Nordic will support the consortium to achieve clinical proof of concept and takes responsibility for clinical development and global commercialization of the vaccine. Current plan is to initiate a clinical study later this year.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Paul Chaplin, President &amp; CEO of Bavarian Nordic said: “We have been interested in the capsid VLP technology for some time and are pleased to support and rapidly advance this highly promising vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2. This technology should lead to a strong protective immune response, even in high risk populations to COVID-19 and together with its high scalability in production make this a winning combination in the fight against this pandemic. We are excited to join forces with Danish biotech companies AdaptVac and ExpreS2ion, as well as the University of Copenhagen and other members of the PREVENT-nCoV consortium in rapidly advancing this differentiated vaccine to the clinic and subsequently leading further development activities.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“AdaptVac and the PREVENT-nCoV consortium are delighted to have Bavarian Nordic join our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts.

<strong>Libtayo® (cemiplimab) shows clinically meaningful and durable responses in second-line advanced basal cell carcinoma</strong>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Objective responses seen in 29% of patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC)</li>
 	<li>In a preliminary analysis, objective responses seen in 21% of patients with metastatic BCC</li>
 	<li>Approximately 85% of patients who responded to Libtayo maintained their response for at least one year</li>
 	<li>Sanofi and Regeneron plan regulatory submissions in 2020</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">
<strong>Paris and Tarrytown, NY – May 5, 2020</strong> - Topline data for a pivotal, single-arm, open-label trial for Sanofi and Regeneron’s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab) in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) who had progressed on or were intolerant to prior hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI) therapy were announced today. Libtayo demonstrated clinically meaningful and durable responses in this group of patients for whom there are no approved treatments. Sanofi and Regeneron plan regulatory submissions in 2020.</p>
<p align=""justify"">BCC is a skin cancer and is the most common cancer worldwide, with approximately two million new cases diagnosed every year in the U.S. alone. While the vast majority of BCCs are caught early and cured with surgery or radiation, a small proportion of tumors can become advanced and penetrate deeper into surrounding tissues (locally advanced), which is more difficult to treat. Approximately 20,000 U.S. patients have advanced BCC and it is estimated that about 3,000 die each year. BCC marks the second non-melanoma skin cancer for which Libtayo has demonstrated first-in-class data and follows its initial U.S. approval in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) in 2018.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In the trial, the objective response rate (ORR) for patients (n=84) with locally advanced disease was 29% (95% CI: 19%-40%), with an estimated duration of response (DOR) exceeding one year in 85% of responders. The durable disease control rate (DCR —response or stable disease lasting at least 6 months) was 60% (95% CI: 48%-70%).  In a preliminary analysis of patients (n=28) with metastatic disease, the ORR was 21% (95% CI: 8%-41%), with an estimated DOR exceeding one year in 83% of responders. The durable DCR was 46% (95% CI: 28%-66%). All data were assessed by an independent central review. Data are expected to continue to evolve with further follow-up across both patient groups.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“While PD-1 inhibitors have transformed the outlook for many patients with melanoma, progress for patients with non-melanoma skin cancers has not been as rapid,” </em>said Peter C. Adamson, M.D, Global Head of Oncology Development at Sanofi.<em> “We are continuing to address this unmet need by first bringing Libtayo to patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and now, with this second trial, as a potential therapy for patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma. These important new results further demonstrate Libtayo’s potential in patients with difficult-to-treat, non-melanoma skin cancers.”</em>
<em>
</em>There were no new safety signals in this trial. Among the 132 patients assessed for safety (84 locally advanced and 48 metastatic), 95% of patients experienced an adverse event (AE), 32% had a serious AE and 13% discontinued due to an AE. There were 10 deaths in the locally advanced group and nine deaths in the metastatic group; none of the deaths were considered treatment-related. Sanofi and Regeneron will present additional trial findings at an upcoming medical meeting.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“Libtayo is being investigated as a monotherapy treatment and as a foundation therapy for combinations with novel therapeutic approaches being developed by Regeneron and our collaborators,” </em>Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron.<em> “These data in advanced BCC provide the third instance where Libtayo monotherapy has demonstrated robust and clinically meaningful outcomes in advanced cancer, and follows last week’s announcement in advanced non-small cell lung cancer where the pivotal trial was stopped early for positive overall survival.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">In this ongoing global Phase 2 trial, patients received Libtayo 350 mg intravenously every three weeks for up to 93 weeks or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or confirmed complete response. ORR is the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints include overall survival, progression-free survival, duration of response, safety and quality of life.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Libtayo is being jointly developed and commercialized by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The use of Libtayo to treat advanced BCC is investigational and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Libtayo</strong>
Libtayo is a fully-human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Libtayo is the first and only immunotherapy approved in the U.S., EU, and other countries for adults with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. In skin cancer, this includes trials in adjuvant and neoadjuvant CSCC. Libtayo is also being investigated in potentially registrational Phase 3 trials in non-small lung cancer and cervical cancer, as well as in trials combining Libtayo with novel therapeutic approaches for both solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.</p>

<b>- Acquisition diversifies and strengthens PTC Therapeutics' rare disorders portfolio -</b><b>- Compelling Phase 3 ready asset to potentially address unmet need in PKU -</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">

SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J., May 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTCT) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Censa Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of CNSA-001 (sepiapterin), a clinical-stage investigational therapy for orphan metabolic diseases, including phenylketonuria (PKU) and other diseases associated with defects in the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biochemical pathways diagnosed at birth. The transaction was approved by the Boards of both companies.

""Results from a Phase 2 clinical trial of CNSA-001 demonstrated significant and clinically relevant reductions in phenylanaline levels compared to current first-line treatment,"" said Stuart W. Peltz, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. ""We believe that CNSA-001 has the potential to address the majority of PKU patients whose condition is not adequately managed by current treatments. We look forward to initiating a Phase 3 study in PKU so that patients diagnosed with this devastating condition can have a new oral treatment option as soon as possible.""

CNSA-001 has been pursued as a possible treatment for orphan metabolic diseases associated with defects in the tetrahydrobiopterin biochemical pathways. CNSA-001 is an oral formulation of synthetic sepiapterin, a precursor to intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin, which is a critical enzymatic cofactor involved in the metabolism and synthesis of numerous metabolic products. The Phase 2 trial evaluating CNSA-001 for PKU met its primary and secondary endpoints in December 2019<sup>1</sup>, and the program is Phase 3 ready.

""I am proud of the team at Censa and its achievements to date demonstrating the potential role of CNSA-001 in treating diseases of the BH4 pathway,"" said Jonathan Reis M.D., M.B.A., President and Chief Executive Officer of Censa Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ""It is the right time to have an excellent fully integrated, patient-focused biotechnology organization like PTC Therapeuticstake over the late-stage development of CNSA-001 so that this promising compound becomes available to patients in the near future.""

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, pending successful fulfillment of closing conditions. PTC is not obligated to give full time employment to any Censa personnel or acquire any additional facilities in connection with the closing.

<b>Transaction Details
</b>Under the terms of the merger agreement, PTC will pay an upfront consideration of approximately $10 million in cash and up to 850,000 shares of PTC common stock. In addition to the upfront payments, potential future consideration includes $217.5 million in development and regulatory milestones for the two most advanced programs and receipt of a priority review voucher, including $30 million to be paid in either cash or PTC common stock at our option for completing the enrollment of a Phase 3 clinical trial for CNSA-001 for PKU, $109 million in development and regulatory milestones for each additional indication of CNSA-001, net sales milestones up to an aggregate amount of $160 million and a contingent value payment of a percentage of annual net sales ranging from single to low double digits.

<b>About Phenylketonuria (PKU)
</b>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused predominantly by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene and resulting in toxic buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) in the brain. Gene mutations of PAH result in inefficient Phe metabolism leading to hyperphenylalaninemia. There are at least 1,000 unique mutations in the PAH gene, resulting in phenotypic variation in the amount of enzyme produced and/or enzyme activity. With the near universal adoption of newborn screening for high plasma phenylalanine PKU is typically diagnosed at birth. PKU has been described in all ethnic groups, and its incidence worldwide varies widely, but is estimated that there are 16,500 patients in the U.S. If left untreated, severe and irreversible disability can occur to include permanent intellectual disability, seizures, delayed development, behavioral problems, and possibly psychiatric disorders. It has been shown that administration of tetrahydrobiopterin improves the function of PAH resulting in reduction in phenylalanine plasma concentration. CNSA-001 has the potential to address the metabolic and neurological signs and symptoms of a broad range of PKU patients.

<b>About Censa Pharmaceuticals
</b>Censa Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing CNSA-001, an oral therapy for phenylketonuria (PKU) patients across all ages and disease severities. Censa's CNSA-001 has demonstrated a strong safety profile and clinical benefit in a Phase 2 study that included a comparison to currently available therapy. CNSA-001 is also being studied in other diseases associated with defects in the tetrahydrobiopterin biochemical pathways. Arkin Bio-Ventures is Censa Pharmaceutical's main institutional investor.

<span class=""xn-location"">EAST HANOVER, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">May 6, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ --  Novartis announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tabrecta<sup>™</sup> (capmatinib, formerly INC280), an oral MET inhibitor for adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping (METex14) as detected by an FDA-approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).

This approval fills a long-recognized and urgent need among METex14 patients who have not had a treatment option approved to specifically target the driver of their lung cancer<sup>3</sup>. Tabrecta is approved for first-line and previously treated patients, regardless of prior treatment type, and is expected to be available to patients in the coming days.

The FDA also approved FoundationOne<sup>®</sup>CDx as the companion diagnostic for Tabrecta, to aid in detecting mutations that lead to MET exon 14 skipping in tumor tissue.

""Non-small cell lung cancer is a complex disease, with many different possible mutations that may encourage the cancer's growth,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Juergen Wolf</span>, MD, from the Center for Integrated Oncology, University Hospital Cologne and lead investigator of the GEOMETRY study. ""MET exon 14 skipping is a known oncogenic driver. With today's decision by the FDA, we can now test for and treat this challenging form of lung cancer with a targeted therapy, offering new hope for patients with NSCLC harboring this type of mutation.""

Novartis was previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for capmatinib.  According to FDA guidelines, treatments that receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation must target a serious or life-threatening disease and demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more significant preliminary research endpoints.

The approval of Tabrecta is based on results from the pivotal GEOMETRY mono-1 Phase II multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort study. In the METex14 population (n=97), the confirmed overall response rate was 68% (95% CI, 48-84) and 41% (95% CI, 29-53) among treatment-naive (n=28) and previously treated patients (n=69), respectively, based on the Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) assessment per RECIST v1.1<sup>1</sup>.<sup> </sup>In patients taking Tabrecta, the study also demonstrated a median duration of response of 12.6 months (95% CI, 5.5–25.3) in treatment-naive patients (19 responders) and 9.7 months (95% CI, 5.5-13.0) in previously treated patients (28 responders)<sup>1</sup>. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (incidence =20%) are peripheral edema, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, and decreased appetite<sup>1</sup>.

""Today, and especially during these difficult times, we are incredibly proud that Tabrecta is the first treatment approved by the FDA specifically to treat patients diagnosed with this aggressive NSCLC associated with METex14,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Susanne Schaffert</span>, PhD, President, <span class=""xn-person"">Novartis Oncology</span>. ""In our quest to reimagine medicine, we have worked tirelessly over the past decades to advance the understanding and treatment of NSCLC, striving to make a difference in patients' lives, one mutation at a time. We thank all the physicians, patients and families involved in the Tabrecta clinical trials, and we remain committed to advancing innovative solutions for the patients we work to serve.""

NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of the 2 million new lung cancer diagnoses each year worldwide, including about 228,000 in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span><sup>4-5</sup>. Nearly 70% of NSCLC patients have a genomic mutation<sup>6</sup>. METex14, a recognized oncogenic driver, occurs in approximately 3%-4% of newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC cases (about 4,000 – 5,000 patients in the US annually)<sup>7-9, 2</sup>.

""With NSCLC, understanding whether a mutation is driving the cancer is critical, and it's important for doctors and patients to use comprehensive biomarker testing at the time of diagnosis or progression to check for mutations like those that cause METex14,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Andrea Ferris</span>, President and CEO of LUNGevity. ""Knowing more about the molecular makeup of their tumor will help patients and their healthcare teams make informed treatment-related decisions from the start.""

Novartis is committed to providing patients with access to medicines, as well as resources and support to address a range of needs. The Novartis Oncology Patient Support Program is available to help guide eligible patients through the various aspects of getting started on treatment, from providing educational information to helping them understand their insurance coverage and identify potential financial assistance options.

<b>About Tabrecta (capmatinib)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Tabrecta (capmatinib) is a kinase inhibitor that targets MET. Tabrecta is licensed to Novartis by Incyte Corporation in 2009. Under the Agreement, Incyte granted Novartis worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all indications.

<b>About GEOMETRY mono-1<br class=""dnr"" /></b>GEOMETRY mono-1 is a Phase II multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort study in adult patients with EGFR wild-type, metastatic NSCLC as measured by ORR.

The trial evaluated 97 adult patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring mutations that lead to METex14 (centrally confirmed) who were assigned to Cohorts 4 (n=69, previously treated patients) or <span class=""xn-money"">5b</span> (n=28, treatment-naive), and received capmatinib tablets 400 mg orally twice daily.

The major efficacy outcome is ORR based on BIRC assessment per RECIST v1.1. An additional efficacy outcome is duration of response by BIRC.

<b>Novartis Commitment to Lung Cancer</b><br class=""dnr"" />Worldwide, lung cancer causes more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined, and more than 2 million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year<sup>4</sup>. Despite treatment advances, many patients with NSCLC still have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options<sup>3</sup>. This includes the nearly 70% of NSCLC patients who have a genomic mutation<sup>6</sup>. To determine the most appropriate treatment, medical organizations recommend comprehensive genomic testing for patients with lung cancer as part of their upfront diagnosis<sup>7</sup>.

Novartis Oncology's research has helped transform treatment approaches for patients living with NSCLC. Novartis continues its commitment to the global lung cancer community through ongoing studies, as well as the exploration of investigational compounds in NSCLC, including those that target genetic biomarkers and tumor promoting inflammation.

<b>Indication <br class=""dnr"" /></b>TABRECTA™ (capmatinib) tablets is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with a kind of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery (metastatic), and whose tumors have an abnormal mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) gene.

The effectiveness of TABRECTA in these patients is based on a study that measured 2 types of response to treatment (response rate and duration of response). There is no clinical information available to show if patients treated with TABRECTA live longer or if their symptoms improve. There are ongoing studies to find out how TABRECTA works over a longer period of time.

It is not known if TABRECTA is safe and effective in children.

<b>Important Safety Information <br class=""dnr"" /></b>TABRECTA may cause serious side effects, such as lung or breathing problems. TABRECTA may cause inflammation of the lungs during treatment that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider right away if they develop any new or worsening symptoms, including cough, fever, trouble breathing, or shortness of breath.

TABRECTA may cause abnormal blood test results, which may be a sign of liver problems.

<div class=""node__content""><b>Otezla Treatment Resulted in Significant Improvements in Measures of Mild-to-Moderate Psoriasis Compared With Placebo</b><b>Data Will be Submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Inclusion in Otezla Prescribing Information</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., May 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced positive top-line results from the ADVANCE trial, a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to assess the efficacy of Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) in adults with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis. The study showed that oral Otezla 30 mg twice daily achieved a statistically significant improvement, compared with placebo, in the primary endpoint of the static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) response (defined as an sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline) at week 16.

In addition, the week 16 secondary endpoints of achieving at least 75% improvement from baseline in the percent of affected body surface area (BSA); change in BSA total score from baseline; and change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) total score from baseline were each also statistically significant for the treatment effect of Otezla compared with placebo.

""Many patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis who use topical therapies still have challenges managing their psoriasis,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""We look forward to discussions with the FDA about the potential to bring Otezla, which has already been prescribed to hundreds of thousands of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, to more patients who may need additional therapeutic options.""

The adverse events observed in this trial were consistent with the known safety profile of Otezla. The most commonly reported adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either treatment group were diarrhea, headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection.

Detailed results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting.

In the U.S., Otezla is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy, adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and for adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet's Disease. Since its initial FDA approval in 2014, Otezla has been prescribed to more than 250,000 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or active psoriatic arthritis in the U.S.<sup>[1]</sup>

<b>About ADVANCE (PSOR-022)</b>

ADVANCE (PSOR-022) is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Otezla in patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis (defined as BSA involvement of 2% to 15%, PASI score of 2 to 15, sPGA score of 2 to 3). The study randomized 595 patients 1:1 to receive Otezla 30 mg twice daily or placebo for the first 16 weeks. All patients then received Otezla during an open-label extension phase through week 32.

The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with sPGA response [defined as a sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline] at week 16.

<b>About Psoriasis</b>

Psoriasis is a serious, chronic inflammatory disease that causes raised, red, scaly patches to appear on the skin, typically affecting the outside of the elbows, knees or scalp, though it can appear on any location.<sup>[2]</sup> Approximately 125 million people worldwide have psoriasis, including around 14 million people in Europeand more than 7.5 million people in the United States.<sup>[3],[4]</sup> About 80% of those patients have plaque psoriasis.<sup>[5]</sup>

<b>About Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast)</b>

Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) 30 mg tablets is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which is thought to indirectly modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. The specific mechanism(s) by which Otezla exerts its therapeutic action in patients is not well defined.

<b>Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) U.S. INDICATIONS</b>

Otezla<b><sup>®</sup></b> (apremilast) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.

Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.

Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet's Disease.

<b><u>Contraindications</u></b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Otezla<b><sup>®</sup></b> (apremilast) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulation</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Warnings and Precautions</u></b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Diarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting: Cases of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were associated with the use of Otezla. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting; advise patients to contact their healthcare provider. Consider Otezla dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting</li>
 	<li>Depression: Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with Otezla for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts/behavior, or in patients who develop such symptoms while on Otezla. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such changes occur
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li><u>Psoriasis:</u> Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.3% (12/920) of patients reported depression compared to 0.4% (2/506) on placebo. Depression was reported as serious in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/506). Suicidal behavior was observed in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients on Otezla, compared to 0.2% (1/506) on placebo. One patient treated with Otezla attempted suicide; one patient on placebo committed suicide</li>
 	<li><u>Psoriatic Arthritis:</u> Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.0% (10/998) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 0.8% (4/495) treated with placebo. Suicidal ideation and behavior was observed in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients on Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients. Depression was reported as serious in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/495). Two patients who received placebo committed suicide compared to none on Otezla</li>
 	<li><u>Behcet's Disease:</u> Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During the clinical trial, 1% (1/104) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 1% (1/103) treated with placebo. No instances of suicidal ideation or behavior were reported in patients treated with Otezla or treated with placebo</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Weight Decrease: Monitor body weight regularly; evaluate unexplained or clinically significant weight loss, and consider discontinuation of Otezla
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li><u>Psoriasis:</u> Body weight loss of 5-10% occurred in 12% (96/784) of patients treated with Otezla and in 5% (19/382) of patients treated with placebo. Body weight loss of =10% occurred in 2% (16/784) of patients treated with Otezla compared to 1% (3/382) of patients treated with placebo</li>
 	<li><u>Psoriatic Arthritis:</u> Body weight loss of 5-10% was reported in 10% (49/497) of patients taking Otezla and in 3.3% (16/495) of patients taking placebo</li>

<b>Forward-Looking Statements</b>

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including Adaptive Biotechnologies (including statements regarding such collaboration's ability to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19), BeiGene, Ltd., or the Otezla<sup>®</sup>(apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

Any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Company to test LAU-7b’s dual pro-resolving inflammation and antiviral properties against COVID-19

Laurent Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Montreal-based biopharmaceutical company, today announced that it has obtained the approval from Health Canada to initiate RESOLUTION, a Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled trial testing once-a-day oral LAU-7b as a potential drug candidate to help combat the COVID-19 disease. The trial, which is planned to start imminently in multiple hospitals in Canada, will enroll approximatively 200 hospitalized COVID-19 patients for a treatment duration of 14 days.

« We are really pleased by the expedited review by Health Canada and we are working closely with clinical sites in Montreal to start enrolling the first patients very soon,» said Radu Pislariu, MD, President and CEO of Laurent Pharmaceuticals. The objective of the treatment is to reduce the severity of the disease and prevent its progression towards an acute respiratory failure known as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Ultimately, we hope the medication could help in keeping hospitalized patients off ventilators, » added Dr Pislariu.

Laurent Pharmaceuticals is developing LAU-7b for its capacity to trigger the resolution phase of inflammation, a natural mechanism that keeps the inflammatory response of the body under control without interfering with its immune role (a “pro-resolving” effect). LAU-7b is believed to interfere with coronavirus replication and host avoidance by acting on the same lipid-modulating pathways it uses for the pro-resolving effect.

« Many patients who have contracted the COVID-19 virus suffer from complications of an inflammatory response that gets out of control. Inflammation is needed to fight infection but, sometimes, the body’s ability to control an inflammatory response may be affected with age or underlying conditions, leading to an overwhelming and self-perpetuating pro-inflammatory environment, » said Dr. Larry Lands, Pneumologist at McGill University Health Center. « Typical anti-inflammatory drugs work by inhibiting the activation mechanisms of the inflammation process, which are also necessary and important for starting the immune defense. As opposed to these drugs, LAU-7b stimulates the natural resolution mechanisms and let’s the body decide when to reduce inflammation – a more biological way to maintain an efficient yet harmless immune-inflammatory balance, » added Dr. Lands.

The RESOLUTION trial follows the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) Master Protocol for COVID-19 clinical studies and will measure the patient health status on a 7-point ordinal scale as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include various measurements of disease progression, duration of hospitalization and quality of life..

About Laurent Pharmaceuticals

Laurent Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on severe inflammatory diseases that are poorly addressed by current anti-inflammatory therapies. The company’s lead drug candidate, LAU-7b, is a unique, patent protected once-a-day oral formulation of fenretinide with high bioavailability ideally applicable to a once-a-day low dose treatment regimen. LAU-7b has the potential to trigger the resolution phase of inflammation, and is currently in a Phase 2 study involving adult patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). LAU-7b (fenretinide), an investigational synthetic retinoid, has a well-documented safety profile established in 3,000+ patients, in various other indications.

<div>Shanghai, China, April 23, 2020 – Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that the company’s drug substance (DS) line and drug product (DP) line for HLX02 trastuzumab biosimilar have successfully passed the European United (EU) Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) on-site inspection and the company has received two EU GMP Certificates (Certificate of GMP Compliance of a Manufacturer) from Poland’s Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector. As one of the most authoritative and rigorous inspections globally, EU GMP inspection is recognized by nearly 30 EU Member States, and the inspection results may also be shared with other countries that have signed Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) with the EU, including the United States, Canada etc.. Therefore, EU GMP Certificate is regarded as a “passport” for drugs to be launched in international market and has significant global impact.</div>
<div></div>
<div>With the EU GMP Certificates, Henlius’ Xuhui Facility has become China's first EU certified GMP site to manufacture a self-developed antibody drug and HLX02 trastuzumab biosimilar is the first China-developed biosimilar that has passed the EU GMP inspection. This means that the company has already built a commercial-scale manufacturing facility and a quality management system that are in line with the EU standards. This also means that China-developed antibody drug is breaking the GMP barriers to be launched on international market, laying a solid foundation for the company to further expand its global footprints.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Dr. Scott Liu, co-founder and CEO of Henlius, said, ""We are very pleased with the successful pass of the EU GMP inspection. This could never be achieved without the team’s 10-year hard work, dedication and Henlius’ pursuit of high quality. We will make every effort to accelerate the global commercialisation progress of HLX02, hoping to benefit more patients and to represent China in the ‘World Cup’ to compete with the world's top bio-pharmaceutical companies from Europe, the United States, South Korea etc.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Mr. Zhang Wenjie, President of Henlius, said, ""In February 2019, the company's first product, HLX01 (rituximab injection), was officially approved by China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), becoming the first biosimilar launched in China. Following the successful launch of HLX01, the NDA of HLX02 has been assigned to the priority review list by NMPA and HLX02 is expected to be launched this year. The EU GMP Certificates are another recognition of the company's high-quality and independently-developed products by the world's authoritative drug regulatory agencies.</div>
<div></div>
<strong>Complying with the Highest Quality Standards, Building the World-class Platform</strong>
<div></div>
<div>The EU has pioneered in the establishment of the regulations of biosimilar medicines in the world. In 2004, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued the draft biosimilar guidelines, opening up a new era for global biosimilars. Since the first biosimilar was approved in 2006, the EU has become the world's most mature market for biosimilars. The Xuhui Facility is located in Caohejing High-tech Park, Xuhui District, Shanghai, designed and built in accordance with the standards of the EU, China and the United States. Ever since its foundation, Henlius has adhered to the highest quality standards in the world and all R&amp;D and production activities are carried out in line with EU quality standards. Head-to-head comparisons have been conducted between biosimilars and originators in the pre-clinical and clinical stages, which has laid the foundation for the company’s globalisation strategy. The Xuhui Facility and its supporting quality management system have passed a number of on-site inspections or audits by the NMPA, EU qualified person and international business partners, and have obtained a GMP certificate from the NMPA.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>China-developed Trastuzumab to </strong><strong>Benefit Global Patients</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>HLX02 is a biosimilar developed and manufactured by Henlius in accordance with international standards, potentially for the treatment of HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer. It was evaluated in an international multi-centre (Mainland China, Ukraine, Poland and the Philippines) Phase 3 clinical study aiming for head-to-head comparison between HLX02 and the originator, which is a key milestone of the company’s globalisation strategy. The study results were presented in the 2019 ESMO Asia Congress held in Singapore, demonstrating that HLX02 has no clinically meaningful differences from the originator trastuzumab in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer.</div>
<div></div>
<div>To fulfil the huge unmet needs of high-quality and affordable biologic medicines worldwide, Henlius has proactively expanded its global presence through continuous strategic collaboration with global leading pharmaceutical companies and has reached strategic cooperation agreements with Accord, Cipla, Mabxience and Jacobson Medical for the commercialisation of HLX02 in over 80 countries and regions around the world. With an extensive presence in North America, Europe, Australia, South Africa etc., Accord has become one of the fastest growing generic pharmaceutical companies focused on developing, manufacturing and distributing generics and biosimilars. Henlius has granted Accord exclusive commercial rights of HLX02 in over 70 countries and regions in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and the Commonwealth of Independent States. In June 2019, Accord submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA on HLX02, making HLX02 the first China-developed trastuzumab biosimilar accepted by the EMA for MAA review, and therefore HLX02 has the potential to become the first China biosimilar approved in the EU.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Looking forward, while keeping with the core values of “Affordable Innovation · Reliable Quality”, Henlius will continue its dedication in the field of oncology and deliver more innovative biologic medicines to provide affordable and effective treatment options for patients worldwide, highlighting the company’s vision of becoming the most trusted and admired biotech company in the world.</div>",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/henlius-3.jpg,Biosimilars,Henlius , HLX02|Trastuzumab,biosimilars|certificates|EU|GMP|injection|receives,publish,23-4-2020,2,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shanghai, China, April 8, 2020 – Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that the investigational new drug (IND) application of its ipilimumab biosimilar HLX13 (a recombinant anti-CTLA-4 fully human monoclonal antibody injection) has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer and adjuvant treatment of melanoma.

<strong>Developed for patients around the globe with high similarity to<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>originatoripilimumab </strong>

HLX13 is a biosimilar<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>of ipilimumab<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). The development of HLX13 is strictly in accordance with Chinese Biosimilar Guidelines. So far,<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>originator<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>ipilimumab has been approved and launched in the U.S. and Europe. Approved indications for ipilimumab monotherapy include adjuvant treatment of melanoma and treatment of advanced melanoma. Combination therapy of ipilimumab and PD-1 inhibitor are approved for the treatment of advanced RCC, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. According to an estimation from Datamonitor, the peak sales of ipilimumab will be more than USD 2.6 billion.

Strictly following the principles of comparability, stepwise development, consistency and similarity assessment, Henlius has conducted a series of head-to-head pre-clinical studies to compare the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics profiles, immunogenicity and toxicity profile of HLX13 and<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>originator<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>ipilimumab. Results from these studies showed that there is a high similarity or no significant difference between HLX13 and<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>originator <span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>ipilimumab in terms of in vivo and in vitro pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicokinetics, immunogenicity and toxicity characteristics. Henlius is committed to provide quality biologics to benefit patients around the globe and will actively explore opportunities to bring HLX13 mono or combination therapies to the global market.

<strong>Blocking inhibitory effects on T cell activation to release the brake of anti-tumour immune response</strong>

Anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that can block the inhibitory effects of CTLA-4 on the co-stimulation signal necessary to T cell activation. It is known that two signals are required to activate T cells and the co-stimulation signal generated by binding between CD28 on T cells and B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells is one of the required signals. CTLA-4, which is also expressed on T cells, has a higher affinity to B7 molecules compared with CD28, and thus can competitively bind to B7 molecule to inhibit the CD28/B7 co-stimulation signal. In addition, signals of CTLA-4 pathway can also terminate T cell activation<sup>[1]</sup>. HLX13 can specifically bind to CTLA-4 to block these inhibitory effects and as a result can help T cell activation in anti-tumour immune response.

<strong>Great clinical application potential for dual immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy</strong>

With the broad application of immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical practice, the potential of the combination therapy of anti-CTLA-4 mAb and anti-PD-1 mAb is becoming more and more attractive. Based on their mechanisms of action (MoA), there is probably a synergistic effect between these two immune checkpoint inhibitors. During the early phase of immune response, anti-CTLA-4 mAb can help maintain T cell activation, while in effector phase anti-PD-1 mAb can inhibit immune escape of tumour cells and restore killing of tumour cells by cytotoxic T cells.

MoA and clinical data suggest treatment with this dual immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy have significant clinical benefit for cancer patients with<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>relatively hightumour mutation burden (TMB) or neoantigen burden, e.g. patients with intermediate- to high-risk renal cell carcinoma, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer,advanced hepatocellular carcinoma or advanced melanoma. Effective treatment options for these patient populations are usually limited and their prognosis is relatively bad. Immune combination therapies for these patients are in urgent need.

<strong>Expanding Henlius future immune combination and bispecific antibody options</strong>

The product pipeline of Henlius has a broad coverage of immune-oncology targets, anti-angiogenesis targets and tumour-specific targets. Clinical development of the company’s anti-PD-1 mAb HLX10 is progressing smoothly and its monotherapy and multiple combination therapies have entered pivotal phases. In the future, there is a great potential of HLX13 to be combined with HLX10 to form a dual immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy. Apart from the indications approved for clinical trials of HLX13 monotherapy, this immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy also has the potential to be evaluated in non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors.

Henlius has established an integrated bispecific antibody R&amp;D and engineering platform and has accumulated extended data and insights on immune-oncology targets like PD-(L)1, OX40, LAG3, TIGIT etc...<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>Clinical progress of HLX13 will lay the foundation for Henlius future endeavors in the development of bispecific antibodies with CTLA-4 target. Leveraging the company’s well-established innovation platform, Henlius will continue discovering and developing quality and affordable innovative therapies to benefit patients around the globe.

<strong>Xbrane Biopharma AB (publ) (”Xbrane” or the ""Company”) (Nasdaq Stockholm: XBRANE) today announces the following update on the ongoing phase III-study Xplore:</strong>

</div>
<div class=""mfn-body"">
<ul>
 	<li>As of today, Xlucane is still on track towards regulatory approval ahead of Lucentis® patent expiration in EU July 2022.</li>
 	<li>Despite the global Corona crisis, Xplore remains open for recruitment of new patients and treatment for patients currently in the study.</li>
 	<li>Xbrane is continuously taking all necessary steps to comply with the new COVID-19 guidance from local authorities and the European Medicines Agency (""EMA"") and the US Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") with patient and clinic personnel safety as first priority.</li>
 	<li>Currently approximately 60% of the planned 580 patients are recruited into Xplore.</li>
 	<li>However, the rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic makes forecasting of future recruitment rate challenging at this stage.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Xplore remains open for recruitment of new patients and treatment for patients currently in the trial</strong>
The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly and will have a significant impact on the global healthcare system. Xbrane will ensure the safety of Xplore study participants as well as the integrity of study data during the COVID-19 pandemic by following recommendations set by the EMA and the FDA.

Based on the circumstances below, Xbrane will maintain Xplore open for recruitment of new patients and continue treatment for all patients currently in the study.
<ul>
 	<li>Patients in Xplore are treated for a critical eye-disease, age related macular degeneration, which if not treated leads to significant vision impairment and in worst case blindness and despite the risk of contamination of COVID-19 and local restrictions there is a desire from patients to be treated.</li>
 	<li>Participation in Xplore does not lead to significantly more visits to a clinic than if the patients would receive standard treatment outside of a clinical trial.</li>
 	<li>Over 50% of clinics are private eye-clinics located separately from general hospitals and therefore with lower risk of contamination of patients and clinic personnel in relation to patient visits.</li>
</ul>
Xbrane is supporting the clinics to take all measures possible to ensure patient safety in relation to visits. Out of the currently recruited patients approximately 42% are based in Eastern Europe, 20% in India, 10% in Israel, 6% in Russia and Ukraine, 14% in the US and 8% in Spain.

<strong>Xlucane is still on track towards regulatory approval ahead of Lucentis® patent expiration in EU July 2022.</strong>
Currently 355 out of 580 (approximately 60%) planned patients are recruited into Xplore and recruitment of new patients have taken place even during last two weeks. COVID-19 will inevitably result in a reduced recruitment rate compared to previously communicated pre-COVID-19 recruitment rate of 60-80 patients per month. Since the situation changes so rapidly any forecasting of recruitment rates in the coming months becomes challenging. Xbrane has previously agreed with the EMA and the FDA to submit Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”)/Biologics License Application (“BLA”) on the basis of an interim read-out when last patient has reached month six in the treatment schedule. As long as Last Patient In to Xplore is recorded latest by end of third quarter 2020 and counting for a twelve month regulatory process, Xlucane is still on track towards approval ahead of Lucentis® patent expiration in EU July 2022.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Important Information about Remdesivir in the United States</span></b>

Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is authorized for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) only for the treatment of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 disease. Severe disease is defined as patients with an oxygen saturation (SpO2) = 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen or requiring mechanical ventilation or requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Remdesivir is authorized for adult or pediatric patients who are admitted to a hospital and for whom use of an IV agent is clinically appropriate, as remdesivir must be administered intravenously.

Remdesivir is an investigational drug that has not been approved by the FDA for any use. It is not yet known if remdesivir is safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19. This use of remdesivir is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use, unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. The FDA Letter of Authorization for the EUA is available at <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gilead.com%2Fremdesivir&amp;esheet=52216760&amp;newsitemid=20200507005738&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.gilead.com%2Fremdesivir&amp;index=2&amp;md5=5458e24d48a6a337bc3a3be45a66c770"" rel=""nofollow"">www.gilead.com/remdesivir</a>.

There are limited clinical data available for remdesivir. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with remdesivir use. Warnings: In clinical studies with remdesivir, infusion-related reactions and liver transaminase elevations have been observed. Remdesivir should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to any ingredient of remdesivir. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant infusion reaction occur, immediately discontinue administration of remdesivir and initiate appropriate treatment. Patients should have appropriate clinical and laboratory monitoring to aid in early detection of any potential adverse events. Monitor renal and hepatic function prior to initiating and daily during therapy with remdesivir; additionally, monitor serum chemistries and hematology daily during therapy. The decision to continue or discontinue remdesivir therapy after development of an adverse event should be made based on the clinical risk benefit assessment for the individual patient.

Healthcare providers and/or their designee are responsible for mandatory FDA MedWatch reporting of all medication errors and serious adverse events or deaths occurring during remdesivir treatment and considered to be potentially attributable to remdesivir. These events must be reported within 7 calendar days from the onset of the event. MedWatch adverse event reports can be submitted to FDA online at <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedwatch&amp;esheet=52216760&amp;newsitemid=20200507005738&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.fda.gov%2Fmedwatch&amp;index=3&amp;md5=644d00f0007b6950dfe03719d10663f9"" rel=""nofollow"">www.fda.gov/medwatch</a> or by calling 1-800-FDA-1088.

This is not all of the important information for remdesivir. The FDA has authorized distribution of this medicine with accompanying Fact Sheets, which can be accessed at <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gilead.com%2Fremdesivir&amp;esheet=52216760&amp;newsitemid=20200507005738&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.gilead.com%2Fremdesivir&amp;index=4&amp;md5=b0509b540e4cb1e6d5ef9698fa8431ba"" rel=""nofollow"">www.gilead.com/remdesivir</a>. Healthcare providers should review the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers for more information on the authorized use of remdesivir and mandatory requirements of the EUA.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Forward-Looking Statement</span></b>

This press release includes forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Remdesivir is an investigational drug that has not been approved by the FDA for any use, and it is not yet known if remdesivir is safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. There is the possibility of unfavorable results from ongoing and additional clinical trials involving remdesivir and the possibility that Gilead and other parties may be unable to complete one or more of such trials in the currently anticipated timelines or at all. Further, it is possible that Gilead may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of remdesivir or that FDA and other regulatory agencies may not approve remdesivir, and any marketing approvals, if granted, may have significant limitations on its use. As a result, remdesivir may never be successfully commercialized. In addition, Gilead may be unable to sufficiently scale up the production of remdesivir in the currently anticipated timelines, and Gilead may be unable to meet future supply needs. These risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those referred to in the forward-looking statements. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These and other risks are described in detail in Gilead’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.

On 30 April 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Insulin aspart
Sanofi, intended for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The applicant for this medicinal product is sanofiaventis groupe.
Insulin aspart Sanofi will be available as a solution for injection (100 units/ml). The active substance of
Insulin aspart Sanofi is insulin aspart, a fast-acting insulin analogue (ATC code: A10AB04) which is
absorbed more rapidly by the body and can therefore act faster than human insulin. The replacement
insulin acts in the same way as naturally produced insulin; it works by facilitating uptake of glucose into
skeletal muscle and fat tissue, and by inhibiting glucose output from the liver.
Insulin aspart Sanofi is a biosimilar medicinal product. It is highly similar to the reference product
NovoRapid (insulin aspart), which was authorised in the EU on 7 September 1999. Data show that Insulin
aspart Sanofi has comparable quality, safety and efficacy to NovoRapid (insulin aspart). More information
on biosimilar medicines can be found here.
The full indication is:
“Insulin aspart Sanofi is indicated for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and
children aged 1 year and above.”
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been
granted by the European Commission",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sanofi-20.jpg,Biosimilars,Sanofi|CHMP,Insulin Aspart ,biosimilars|approval|CHMP|positive|receives|recommendation ,publish,30-4-2020,2,,,,,,,,,,,,
