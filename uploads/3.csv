<span class=""xn-location"">PHILADELPHIA</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 11, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lannett-provides-update-on-clinical-advancement-of-biosimilar-insulin-glargine-following-fda-meeting-301074221.html#financial-modal"">LCI</a>) today said that representatives from the company spoke with and received guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the clinical advancement program of its biosimilar insulin glargine partnered product candidate. Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin used to treat adults with Type 2 diabetes, as well as adults and pediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes, for the control of high blood sugar. Total U.S. sales of the glargine related products, according to IQVIA, were approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$9.5 billion</span> for the 12 months ending <span class=""xn-chron"">April 2020</span>, although actual biosimilar market values are expected to be lower.

""At the Biosimilar Biological Product Development (BPD) Type II meeting held earlier this week the FDA provided positive feedback on the clinical and CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls) advancement of our biosimilar insulin glargine that was consistent with our expectations,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Tim Crew</span>, chief executive officer of Lannett. ""Our path forward is clear with regard to what is expected in the planned 351(k) biosimilar application, which we anticipate will be filed in calendar year 2022. We will work with our strategic partner to complete all the necessary development activity, including human clinical trials, in accordance with FDA's guidance.""

Crew added, ""Biosimilar insulin glargine represents a significant opportunity for Lannett, given the notably large addressable market. Moreover, we believe only a relatively small number of competitors have the technical expertise and requisite resources to develop and manufacture such a complex product.""

The company previously announced positive results from the first human study evaluating insulin glargine that Lannett is developing with its strategic alliance partners within the HEC Group of companies (HEC). The trial confirmed that the Lannett/HEC biosimilar insulin glargine was biosimilar to US-approved Lantus<sup>®</sup> (the reference biologic) in terms of meeting all pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) safety endpoints in the study.

Lantus<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of Sanofi S.A.

<strong>Clinical program consists of four separate study populations: two for treatment and two for prevention</strong>

<strong>First studies evaluate safety and efficacy in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19</strong>

<strong>Two-antibody 'cocktail' is designed to help protect against viral escape</strong>

<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2827069-1&amp;h=100563873&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fregeneron.com%2F&amp;a=Regeneron+Pharmaceuticals%2C+Inc."" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</a> (NASDAQ:<strong> REGN</strong>) today announced initiation of the first clinical trial of REGN-COV2, its investigational dual antibody cocktail for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The REGN-COV2 clinical program will consist of four separate study populations: hospitalized COVID-19 patients, non-hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 patients, uninfected people in groups that are at high-risk of exposure (such as healthcare workers or first responders) and uninfected people with close exposure to a COVID-19 patient (such as the patient's housemate). The placebo-controlled trials will be conducted at multiple sites.

""We have created a unique anti-viral antibody cocktail with the potential both to prevent and treat infection, and also to preempt viral 'escape,' a critical precaution in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. ""REGN-COV2 could have a major impact on public health by slowing spread of the virus and providing a needed treatment for those already sick – and could be available much sooner than a vaccine. The antibody cocktail approach may also have long-term utility for elderly and immuno-compromised patients, who often do not respond well to vaccines. Ultimately, the world needs multiple solutions for COVID-19, and the innovative biopharma industry is collectively working hard to help as many people as possible with a variety of complementary approaches.""

Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company's proprietary<em> VelocImmune<sup>® </sup></em>mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies isolated from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. They selected the two most potent, non-competing and virus-neutralizing antibodies and have scaled them up for clinical use with the company's in-house <em>VelociMab<sup>®</sup></em> and manufacturing capabilities. The two antibodies bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus's spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment, as demonstrated in upcoming <a href=""https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/two-science-publications-highlight-potential-regn-cov2-anti""><em>Science</em></a> publications of preclinical research.

Regeneron used the same 'rapid response' capabilities and cocktail approach to develop REGN-EB3, a novel triple antibody treatment for Ebola that is now under regulatory review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). REGN-COV2's preclinical development and preclinical/clinical manufacturing has been funded in part with federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

The first two adaptive Phase 1/2/3 studies are evaluating REGN-COV2 (REGN10933+REGN10987) as a treatment for hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The Phase 1 portion will focus on virologic and safety endpoints, and the Phase 2 portion will focus on virologic and clinical endpoints. Data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies will be used to refine the endpoints and determine size for the Phase 3 studies.

""We are particularly excited to begin studies of REGN-COV2, which is a novel antibody cocktail targeted specifically against SARS-CoV-2,"" said trial investigator Dr. Suraj Saggar, Chief of Infectious Disease at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey. ""Over the last long months, we have learned that repurposing existing medicines unfortunately does not offer a broadly effective solution for COVID-19. For this reason, we need to investigate custom-designed approaches like REGN-COV2. The first studies will evaluate if REGN-COV2 can improve disease outcomes in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19.""

<strong>About Regeneron's Anti-Viral Antibodies</strong>
When faced with a harmful pathogen, such as a virus or bacteria, the human immune system typically produces antibodies to fight the invader. Specifically, the immune system produces 'anti-viral' antibodies that recognize, bind, and kill or neutralize the virus. Vaccination involves injecting a dead or weakened virus, or a critical small piece of a virus, to induce this protective immune response, resulting in the same antibodies the immune system would typically make in a person who actually had the infectious disease.

Regeneron's core technologies allow for rapid and efficient generation of these protective anti-viral antibodies outside of the body, derived from either genetically-humanized mice or convalescent humans. The resulting antibodies correspond to the most potent of anti-viral antibodies that could be elicited by a vaccine or through exposure to a pathogen. These antibodies can be delivered to people via injection, providing ""passive immunity"" and protection from the disease immediately, though they must be re-administered to remain effective over time. These antibodies can also treat an existing infection, unlike vaccines which can only be used preventatively.

The concept that drug cocktails can prevent viral escape has previously been demonstrated for traditional antiviral drugs used to treat HIV and other viruses. In the upcoming <em>Science</em> publications, Regeneron scientists report the fundamental realization that this can also be true for antibody-based therapies. Regeneron's preclinical studies demonstrate that, in the setting of a single therapeutic antibody that blocks the ability of a virus to infect healthy cells, spontaneously arising mutant forms of the virus are able to 'escape' or evade the antibody's blocking action. These mutants are then 'selected' (i.e., are able to survive and proliferate despite the single antibody treatment) and may ultimately become the dominant strain of the virus. Regeneron therefore pursues a multi-antibody cocktail approach designed to decrease the potential for the virus to escape.

Regeneron has developed additional technologies that allow for the large-scale manufacturing and purification of these anti-viral antibodies, potentially allowing many people to be granted immunity before vaccines become widely available.

(“Celltrion”), an Incheon, South Korea-based biopharmaceutical company specializing in the research, development and manufacturing of small molecules, biosimilars and innovative drugs. Takeda will receive $266 million USD upfront in cash and up to an additional $12 million USD in potential milestone payments, subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions.

<p id=""pull-quote"">“Across our Growth &amp; Emerging Markets, Takeda must focus on accelerating the commercial availability of our highly innovative medicines for patients living with complex and rare conditions, and expanding our approach to Access to Medicines across the Region”</p>

<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200611005426/en/Takeda-Divest-OTC-Select-Non-core-Assets-Asia#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
The portfolio to be divested to Celltrion includes a variety of OTC products and pharmaceutical products in the Cardiovascular, Diabetes and General Medicine therapeutic areas sold predominantly in Australia, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, which are part of Takeda’s Growth &amp; Emerging Markets Business Unit. The portfolio generated FY 2018 net sales of approximately $140 million USD, driven by strong sales of prescription products Nesina<sup>®</sup> and Edarbi<sup>®</sup>. While the products included in the sale continue to play important roles in meeting patient needs in these countries, they are outside of Takeda's chosen business areas – Gastroenterology (GI), Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology and Neuroscience – that are core to its global long-term growth strategy.

“Across our Growth &amp; Emerging Markets, Takeda must focus on accelerating the commercial availability of our highly innovative medicines for patients living with complex and rare conditions, and expanding our approach to Access to Medicines across the Region,” said Ricardo Marek, President, Growth &amp; Emerging Markets Business Unit, Takeda. “Doing so, better addresses patient unmet needs. While we remain committed to Asia Pacific, and the Emerging Markets, divesting non-core products helps achieve those goals.”

“This announcement marks continued progress on our commitment to divest non-core products as we remain focused on maintaining our financial discipline and rapid deleveraging following our acquisition of Shire,” said Costa Saroukos, Chief Financial Officer, Takeda. “One of several transactions since the launch of the divestment program, the sale announced today will further focus Takeda on our five key business areas and our pipeline of innovative medicines. We look forward to continuing to execute and deliver on Takeda’s financial commitments, including paying down debt and focusing our portfolio.”

Takeda has made strong progress on its ongoing divestiture program. In March 2020, Takeda completed sales of non-core assets spanning the Russia-CIS region to STADA for $660 million USD and in countries spanning the Near East, Middle East and Africa region to Acino for $200 million USD. In July 2019, Takeda completed the divestiture of Xiidra<sup>®</sup> to Novartis for up to $5.3 billion USD. Additionally, earlier this year, Takeda announced the sales of non-core products in Latin America to Hypera Pharma for $825 million USD and in Europe to Orifarm Group for up to approximately $670 million USD, including the sale of two manufacturing sites in Denmark and Poland.

Takeda intends to use the proceeds from its divestitures to continue to reduce its debt and accelerate deleveraging toward its target of 2x net debt/adjusted EBITDA within March 2022 – March 2024.

<b>Transaction Details</b>

Takeda has entered into an agreement to sell a portfolio of 18 select OTC and prescription pharmaceutical assets sold in Australia, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand to Celltrion for a total value of up to $278 million USD. Takeda will receive $266 million USD upfront in cash and up to an additional $12 million USD in potential milestone payments, subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions.

Takeda and Celltrion have also entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement under which Takeda will continue to manufacture the portfolio of divested products and supply them to Celltrion. Under the terms of the agreement, Celltrion will acquire the rights, title and interest to the products in the portfolio exclusive to these countries.

The transaction is expected to close by end of the calendar year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, receipt of required regulatory clearances and, where applicable, compliance with local works council requirements. Until then, Takeda remains the owner of these products and responsible for ensuring patient access to them.

Takeda is being advised by BofA Securities as its financial advisor and White &amp; Case is its legal advisor in this transaction.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Next Generation Closed Loop Insulin Pump System Features 
Auto-Correction Algorithm and Bluetooth Connectivity

DUBLIN, June 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced CE (Conformité Européenne) Marking of its MiniMed™ 780G system, a next generation closed loop insulin pump system for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in people age 7 to 80 years. Leveraging the company’s most advanced SmartGuard™ algorithm, the system automates the delivery of both basal insulin and correction boluses every five minutes to help people with diabetes avoid highs and lows with greater ease. The MiniMed 780G system enables the personalization of glucose goals with an adjustable target setting as low as 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) — lower than any other advanced hybrid closed loop system — and is designed to help stabilize blood sugar levels and further improve glucose control.

“We wanted to design a system that further simplifies diabetes management and adapts to people’s life with the goal of enhancing their experience in a seamless way,” said Sean Salmon, Executive Vice President and President of the Diabetes Group at Medtronic. “We know it can be challenging to have to calculate carbohydrate intake before every snack or meal on a daily basis to ensure the right amount of insulin is dosed. With this system, users will have an extra layer of coverage for those times they miscalculate their carbs or forget to pre-bolus with analgorithm that automatically corrects for high glucose when needed. We want to help people spend more time living their life and less time worrying about their diabetes management — we’re confident this system delivers on that important goal.”

Patients who participated in the clinical study provided feedback that the MiniMed 780G system “made life with diabetes and control so much easier” and that it made “life significantly easier.”

In addition to the automated algorithm which includes technology from DreaMed Diabetes, the MiniMed 780G system was designed to be easy to use by requiring less input from the user1. With the addition of Bluetooth® connectivity, the MiniMed 780G system will enable users and their care partners to see real-time glucose data and trends on compatible iOS and Android smartphones via apps. Additionally, healthcare providers will find that managing patients on the system is simple as there are only a few settings that need adjustment to enable optimal use of the technology.

“I am incredibly proud of the strong collaboration that resulted in this meaningful step forward with the MiniMed 780G system, which the clinical trial has demonstrated to be a beneficial tool for a wide range of patients and particularly adolescents,” said Professor Moshe Phillip, director of the Institute for Endocrinology and Diabetes, National Center of Childhood Diabetes, Schneider Children’s Medical Center of Israel, co-founder and chief science officer, DreaMed Diabetes. “By continuing to increase the automation of insulin pump systems, we can further reduce burden for people living with diabetes while simultaneously driving positive clinical outcomes.”

The system is expected to begin shipping this Fall in select countries in Europe. In the United States, the MiniMed 780G system is investigational use only and not approved for sale.

The data from three trials using the next generation advanced hybrid closed loop system from Medtronic will be presented in a symposium at the virtual 80th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association.

 Symposium: The Next Generation of Automated Insulin Delivery Systems for Persons with Type 1 Diabetes – Four New Clinical Trials
 June 12, 2:00 – 4:00 pm (CDT)
The MiniMed 780G system is part of the new Medtronic portfolio of insulin pumps with smartphone connectivityvia Bluetooth. Additional systems with CE Mark include the MiniMed™ 770G2 system which uses the same hybrid closed loop technology as the current MiniMed™ 670G system that is available in many parts of the world. There is also a MiniMed™ 720G3 system with CE Mark that provides readings from a Medtronic glucose sensor without automating any insulin delivery based off those readings. These MiniMed™ 700 series pumps will be made available in countries around the world based on local market approvals and regulations.

1 When the MiniMed 780G system is not using the SmartGuard feature, pump functions are operating in manual mode. In manual mode, the sensor glucose readings from Guardian™ Sensor 3 are not intended to be used directly for making therapy adjustments, but rather to provide an indication of when a finger stick/BG meter reading may be required. All therapy adjustments should be based on measurements obtained using a home glucose monitor and not on values provided by the Guardian™ Sensor 3 in manual mode.

<h3><b><i>Company exploring further additional global

</i></b></h3>

<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca has reached an agreement with Europe’s Inclusive Vaccines Alliance (IVA), spearheaded by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, to supply up to 400 million doses of the University of Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine, with deliveries starting by the end of 2020.

With today’s agreement, the IVA aims to accelerate the supply of the vaccine and to make it available to other European countries that wish to participate in the initiative. The IVA is committed to providing equitable access to all participating countries across Europe.

AstraZeneca continues to build a number of supply chains in parallel across the world, including for Europe. The Company is seeking to expand manufacturing capacity further and is open to collaborating with other companies in order to meet its commitment to support access to the vaccine at no profit during the pandemic.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “This agreement will ensure that hundreds of millions of Europeans have access to Oxford University’s vaccine following approval. With our European supply chain due to begin production soon, we hope to make the vaccine available widely and rapidly. I would like to thank the governments of Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands for their commitment and swift response.”

The Company has recently completed similar agreements with the UK, US, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi the Vaccine Alliance for 700 million doses, and it agreed a licence with the Serum Institute of India for the supply of an additional one billion doses, principally for low- and middle-income countries. Total manufacturing capacity currently stands at two billion doses.

Oxford University last month announced the start of a Phase II/III UK trial of AZD1222 in about 10,000 adult volunteers. Other late-stage trials are due to begin in a number of countries. AstraZeneca recognises that the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical programme with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk.

The Company’s comprehensive pandemic response also includes rapid mobilisation of AstraZeneca’s global research efforts to discover novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies to prevent and treat progression of the COVID-19 disease, with the aim of reaching clinical trials in the next three to five months. Additionally, the Company has quickly moved into testing of new and existing medicines to treat the infection, including the <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/articles/2020/investigating-an-existing-medicine-as-a-potential-treatment-for-covid-19.html"">CALAVI</a> trials underway for <i>Calquence</i> (acalabrutinib) and the <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/articles/2020/investigating-an-existing-cvrm-medicine-as-a-potential-treatment-for-covid-19.html"">DARE-19</a> trial for <i>Farxiga </i>(dapagliflozin) in COVID-19 patients.

<b>Financial Considerations</b>

Today’s announcement is not anticipated to have any significant impact on the Company’s financial guidance for 2020; costs to manufacture the vaccine are anticipated to be offset by funding by governments.

<b>AZD1222</b>

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, now known as AZD1222, was developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, working with the Oxford Vaccine Group. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold (adenovirus) virus that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack COVID-19 if it later infects the body.

The recombinant adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1) was chosen to generate a strong immune response from a single dose and it is not replicating, so cannot cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual. Vaccines made from the ChAdOx1 virus have been given to more than 320 people to date and have been shown to be well tolerated, although they can cause temporary side effects such as a temperature, influenza-like symptoms, headache or a sore arm.

including Ebola, Marburg, MERS and SARS. In vitro testing conducted by Gilead has
demonstrated that Remdesivir is active against the virus that causes COVID-19. The safety
and efficacy of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 are being evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase
3 clinical trials.
Remdesivir must be administered intravenously. Under this EUA, the 10-day dosing duration
is suggested for patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the 5-day dosing duration is suggested for patients not
requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO. If a patient on the 5-day dosing
duration does not demonstrate clinical improvement after five days, treatment may be
extended for up to five additional days (10 days total).

<b>- Study Will Further Understanding of Baricitinib's Potential as a COVID-19 Treatment</b> <b>- Data Will Complement Ongoing NIAID Trial and Investigator-Initiated Trials</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">

INDIANAPOLIS, June 15, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced today that the first patient has been enrolled in a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo–controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib, an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor licensed from Incyte, in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Baricitinib, marketed as OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup>, is approved in 70 countries as a treatment for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Lilly expects to enroll 400 patients in the trial, with data expected in the next few months. The study will be conducted in the U.S., Europe and Latin America and includes patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have at least one elevated marker of inflammation but do not require invasive mechanical ventilation at study entry.

In COVID-19 infection, increased disease severity can be associated with a hyperinflammatory state. It is hypothesized that through JAK1 and JAK2 inhibition, baricitinib may reduce the cytokine storm associated with the complications of this infection. In addition, baricitinib may have a role in inhibiting the host cell proteins that assist in viral reproduction, reducing the ability of infected cells to make more virus. A manuscript detailing this mechanism of action of baricitinib in COVID-19 has been accepted for publication by <i>EMBO Molecular Medicine</i>.

The primary endpoint for Lilly's study is the proportion of patients who die or require non-invasive ventilation/high-flow oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation by Day 28 in patients treated with 4 mg of baricitinib daily (with background therapy) compared to placebo (with background therapy). Patients will receive baricitinib or placebo for up to 14 days or until discharge from the hospital. Key secondary outcomes of this study include the proportion of patients with clinical improvement at different time points, time to recovery, duration of hospitalization, number of ventilator-free days and mortality over a 28-day period.

""Lilly is committed to fighting this global pandemic, and this includes testing whether existing medicines including baricitinib could help treat the complications of COVID-19 in patients,"" said Patrik Jonsson, Lilly senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. ""This randomized controlled study is an important step in our understanding of baricitinib as a potential COVID-19 treatment.""

""While the approach to addressing COVID-19 continues to evolve, we're pleased to partner with Lilly in this trial to assess baricitinib's potential in the fight against COVID-19 and look forward to learning more about its impact on patients,"" said Patrick Milligan, M.D., of Community Health Network in Indianapolis, U.S., one of the first sites participating in the study.

""Following upon the success of remdesivir to treat moderate to severe COVID-19, hospitalized patients are still in need of novel approaches to reduce mortality,"" said Vincent C. Marconi, M.D., professor of medicine and global health at Emory University School of Medicine and Emory's Rollins School of Public Health. ""Several ongoing studies with baricitinib will provide necessary data about this treatment that may combine antiviral activity with suppression of cytokine storm.""

The data from Lilly's trial will complement data from <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2829270-1&amp;h=3202138579&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.lilly.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Flilly-begins-clinical-testing-therapies-covid-19&amp;a=the+study+of+baricitinib"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">the study of baricitinib</a> with remdesivir in the second phase of the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This study – which enrolled its first patient last month – assesses the efficacy and safety of the combination of a 4-mg daily dose of baricitinib plus remdesivir, compared to remdesivir.

Lilly is also supporting select ongoing multisite and single-site investigator-initiated trials in Europe and North America for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections. These studies by academic and government institutions will provide information on hundreds of additional patients treated with baricitinib and either placebo or active comparators.

Should research efforts for baricitinib in COVID-19 prove successful, Lilly will continue to create adequate supply to support both appropriate clinical and investigational use.

Studying baricitinib in controlled trials is important in order to better characterize its potential benefits and understand the safety of its use as a COVID-19 treatment. The U.S. prescribing information for the approved use of baricitinib for RA includes boxed warnings regarding the use of baricitinib, including warnings about risk for developing blood clots and serious infections.

<b>About Lilly's COVID-19 Efforts
</b>Lilly is bringing the full force of its scientific and medical expertise to attack COVID-19 around the world. We are fighting the pandemic with everything we can: discovering potential medicines to treat and prevent COVID-19, maintaining a reliable supply of our medicines, and supporting patients and communities in times of need. Lilly is studying multiple approaches to treat COVID-19, including potential antibodies designed specifically to attack the virus and existing Lilly medicines to understand their potential in treating complications of COVID-19.

<b>Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients
</b>OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup> (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS</b><b> </b>

<b>WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS</b>

<b><i>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</i>:</b> <b>Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.</b>

<b>Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.</b>

<b><i>MALIGNANCIES</i>: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.</b>

<b><i>THROMBOSIS</i>: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.</b>

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS: </b>The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>with chronic or recurrent infection</li>
 	<li>who have been exposed to TB</li>
 	<li>with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection</li>
 	<li>who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or</li>
 	<li>with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.</li>
</ul>
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

<b>Tuberculosis </b>– Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

<b>Viral Reactivation</b> – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

<b>MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS:</b> Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

<b>THROMBOSIS</b><b>:</b>  Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

<b>GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: </b>Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

<b>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:
</b><b><i>Neutropenia</i></b> – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

<b><i>Lymphopenia</i></b> – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

<b><i>Anemia</i></b> – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to &lt;8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

<b><i>Liver Enzyme Elevations</i></b> – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to =5x and =10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

<b><i>Lipid Elevations</i></b> – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

<b>VACCINATIONS</b>:  Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</b>Adverse reactions (=1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.

<b>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
</b><b>PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: </b>No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

<b>HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: </b>Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

<b>About OLUMIANT<sup>®
</sup></b>OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies, and approved outside of the U.S. for patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs.<sup>i</sup> There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.<sup>ii</sup> OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.<sup>i</sup>

In December 2009, Lilly and Incyte announced an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of baricitinib and certain follow-on compounds for patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

GARDASIL 9 is indicated in males 9 through 45 years of age for the prevention of anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; anal precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; and genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11.

GARDASIL<sup>®</sup>9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant) is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast, or after a previous dose of GARDASIL 9 or GARDASIL<sup>®</sup> [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant].

Both men and women can be at risk for HPV-attributable oropharyngeal cancer; however, this cancer affects men five times more than women.<sup>1</sup> For most people, HPV clears on its own. But, for those who don't clear the virus, it can cause certain cancers. Oropharyngeal cancer can arise as a result of HPV infection in the oropharynx, which includes the soft palate, side and back wall of the throat, tonsils, and back one-third of the tongue. According to a recent model published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV-attributable oropharyngeal cancer has surpassed cervical cancer as the most prevalent type of HPV-related cancer in the U.S.<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1 </sup>The CDC analyzed data from the U.S. Cancer Statistics (USCS) to assess the incidence of HPV-associated cancers and to estimate the annual number of cancers caused by HPV, overall and by state, during 2012 to 2016.

The estimated number of HPV-attributable cancers was calculated by multiplying the average number of HPV-associated cancers by the percentage of HPV-attributable cancers diagnosed from 1993 to 2005, before HPV vaccination was available in the U.S.

The detection of HPV DNA in an HPV study is not enough to determine that HPV caused the cancer.

Not all cervical and oropharyngeal cancers are caused by HPV.

<b>Important Information About GARDASIL 9</b>

GARDASIL 9 does not eliminate the necessity for vaccine recipients to undergo screening for cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers as recommended by a healthcare provider.

GARDASIL 9 has not been demonstrated to provide protection against diseases caused by:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>HPV types not covered by the vaccine</li>
 	<li>HPV types to which a person has previously been exposed through sexual activity</li>
</ul>
Not all vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers are caused by HPV, and GARDASIL 9 protects only against those vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.

GARDASIL<sup>®</sup>9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant) is not a treatment for external genital lesions; cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers; or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN), or anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN).

Vaccination with GARDASIL 9 may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.

<b>Select Safety Information for GARDASIL 9</b>

GARDASIL 9 is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast, or after a previous dose of GARDASIL 9 or GARDASIL<sup>®</sup> [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant].

Because vaccinees may develop syncope, sometimes resulting in falling with injury, observation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic movements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported following HPV vaccination. When syncope is associated with tonic-clonic movements, the activity is usually transient and typically responds to restoring cerebral perfusion.

Safety and effectiveness of GARDASIL 9 have not been established in pregnant women.

The most common (=10%) local and systemic adverse reactions in females were injection-site pain, swelling, erythema, and headache. The most common (=10%) local and systemic reactions in males were injection-site pain, swelling, and erythema.

The duration of immunity of GARDASIL 9 has not been established.

<b>Dosage and Administration for GARDASIL 9</b>

GARDASIL 9 should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid or anterolateral area of the thigh.
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>For individuals 9 through 14 years of age, GARDASIL 9 can be administered using a 2-dose or 3-dose schedule. For the 2-dose schedule, the second dose should be administered 6-12 months after the first dose. If the second dose is administered less than 5 months after the first dose, a third dose should be given at least 4 months after the second dose. For the 3-dose schedule, GARDASIL 9 should be administered at 0, 2 months, and 6 months.</li>
 	<li>For individuals 15 through 45 years of age, GARDASIL 9 is administered using a 3-dose schedule at 0, 2 months, and 6 months.</li>
</ul>
<b>About HPV and HPV-related Cancers and Diseases</b>

According to the CDC, an estimated 14 million new HPV infections occur every year in the United States. HPV is so common that 80% of people who are sexually active get HPV at some point in their life. For most people, HPV clears on its own; but for those who don’t clear the virus, it could cause certain cancers and diseases. There is no way to know which people who have HPV will develop cancer or other health problems. GARDASIL<sup>®</sup>9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant) helps protect against seven HPV types that cause the majority of HPV-related cancers in the United States. Persistent HPV infection can also lead to pre-cancerous lesions that may require additional follow-up procedures. With the exception of cervical cancer, there is no routinely recommended screening for the detection of HPV-related cancers.
