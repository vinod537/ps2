<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">May 25, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved VENCLYXTO<sup>®</sup> (venetoclax) in combination with a hypomethylating agent, azacitidine or decitabine, for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.<sup>1</sup> The approval is valid in all 27 member states of the EU, as well as <span class=""xn-location"">Iceland</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Liechtenstein</span>, and <span class=""xn-location last-child"">Norway</span>.

&nbsp;

""VENCLYXTO has proven incremental overall survival in treating newly diagnosed AML in patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy when treated with VENCLYXTO plus azacitidine compared to those treated with azacitidine alone,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Mohamed Zaki</span>, M.D., Ph.D., vice president and head, global oncology development, AbbVie. ""We look forward to bringing VENCLYXTO to more AML patients who can potentially benefit from this important new treatment option in EU countries.""

This is the third extension of indications for VENCLYXTO, a first-in-class B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor. BCL-2 is a protein that prevents cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis, the process that leads to the natural death or self-destruction of cancer cells.<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1 </sup>

This most recent approval is based on results from the Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled VIALE-A (M15-656) and the Phase <span class=""xn-money first-child"">1b</span> open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter M14-358 clinical trials. The VIALE-A trial demonstrated patients who received VENCLYXTO in combination with azacitidine showed statistically significantly greater median overall survival (OS) than patients receiving azacitidine alone (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001).<sup>2</sup> The Phase <span class=""xn-money"">1b</span> M14-358 trial evaluating venetoclax in combination with hypomethylating agents, azacitidine or decitabine, exhibited an overall safety profile that was generally consistent with the known safety profiles of venetoclax combined with azacitidine and the two medications alone.<sup class=""last-child"">3</sup>

In the VIALE-A trial, the most frequently reported serious adverse events (AEs) in the VENCLYXTO plus azacitidine arm and placebo plus azacitidine arm were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, sepsis, and haemorrhage.<sup class=""first-child"">2</sup> In the M14-358 trial, the most frequently reported serious AEs in patients receiving VENCLYXTO in combination with decitabine were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, bacteraemia and sepsis.<sup class=""last-child"">3</sup>

""The European Commission approval of venetoclax combination therapy offers a new option for people facing what is often a devastating acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Zack Pemberton-Whiteley</span>, Chair of the Acute Leukemia Advocates Network. ""This approval represents an important advancement for the treatment of AML and offers an option for those who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.""

In April 2021, AbbVie announced that the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted a positive opinion for the Marketing Authorization Application for VENCLYXTO in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

VENCLYXTO is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S.

<b class=""first-child"">About Acute Myeloid Leukemia<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>AML is the most common acute leukemia in the world.<sup>4</sup> An estimated 160,000 people are currently living with the disease globally.<sup>4</sup> The rate of new cases of acute myeloid leukemia is 4.3 per 100,000 men and women per year.<sup>5</sup> It is also among the most difficult blood cancers to treat.<sup>6</sup> Despite advances in available therapies and care, the five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with AML remains approximately 29 percent.<sup>5</sup> AML typically worsens quickly, and due to age and comorbidities, not all patients can tolerate intensive chemotherapy.<sup class=""last-child"">7</sup>

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About the VENCLYXTO AML Clinical Trial Program<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>AbbVie's clinical trial program to evaluate VENCLYXTO combination with a hypomethylating agent in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy included two studies conducted around the world.

<b class=""first-child""><i class=""first-child last-child"">VIALE-A (M15-656) Phase 3 Trial</i></b><sup>2</sup>
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled VIALE-A (M15-656) trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of VENCLYXTO in combination with azacitidine in patients with newly diagnosed AML who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The study met its primary endpoints of statistically significant improvement of overall survival (OS) and composite complete remission (complete remission [CR]+complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) (CR + CRi). Overall survival was 14.7 months for the VENCLYXTO plus azacitidine arm versus 9.6 months in the placebo plus azacitidine arm, and the composite complete remission rate was 66.4 percent versus 28.3 percent, respectively. The study also met secondary endpoints, with the VENCLYXTO plus azacitidine arm resulting in a CR rate of 36.7 percent vs. 17.9 percent in the placebo plus azacitidine arm. The safety profile of VENCLYXTO plus azacitidine was consistent with the known side-effect profiles of both agents, and adverse events (AEs) were consistent with expectations for an older AML population. The most frequently reported serious AEs in the VENCLYXTO plus azacitidine arm and placebo plus azacitidine arm were febrile neutropenia (in 30 percent and 10 percent), pneumonia (in 17 percent and 22 percent), sepsis (in 6 percent and 8 percent), and haemorrhage (in 9 percent and 6 percent), respectively.<sup class=""last-child"">2</sup>

<b class=""first-child""><i class=""first-child last-child"">M14-358 Phase <span class=""xn-money first-child last-child"">1b</span> Trial</i></b><sup>3</sup><br class=""last-child"" />The non-randomized, open-label M14-358 trial evaluated VENCLYXTO in combination with azacitidine or decitabine in patients with newly diagnosed AML who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Patients treated with VENCLYXTO in combination with decitabine achieved a CR+CRi rate of 74 percent and a 30-day mortality rate of 6.5 percent. The median follow-up was 40.4 months (range: 0.7 to 42.7 months) for venetoclax in combination with decitabine. The most frequently reported serious AEs (=5%) in patients receiving VENCLYXTO in combination with decitabine were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, bacteraemia and sepsis, with neutropenia reported in 35 percent (all grades) and 35 percent (grade 3 or 4) of patients in the venetoclax + decitabine arm. No events of laboratory or clinical TLS were reported with venetoclax in combination with decitabine.

<b class=""first-child"">About VENCLYXTO<sup class=""first-child"">®</sup> (venetoclax) <br class=""last-child"" /></b>VENCLYXTO<sup class=""last-child"">®</sup> (venetoclax) is a first-in-class medicine that selectively binds and inhibits the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers, BCL-2 prevents cancer cells from undergoing their natural death or self-destruction process, called apoptosis. VENCLYXTO targets the BCL-2 protein and works to help restore the process of apoptosis.

VENCLYXTO is also approved in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy, and as a monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in the presence or absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1</sup>

VENCLYXTO is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. Together, the companies are committed to BCL-2 research and to studying venetoclax in clinical trials across several blood. Venetoclax is approved in more than 80 countries, including the U.S.

<b class=""first-child"">Indications and Important <b class=""first-child last-child"">Venclyxto</b> (venetoclax) EU Safety Information</b><sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>

<b class=""first-child last-child"">Indications</b>

Venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).

Venclyxto in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.

Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li class=""first-child"">In the presence of 17p deletion or <i class=""first-child last-child"">TP53</i> mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor, or</li>
 	<li class=""last-child"">In the absence of 17p deletion or <i class=""first-child last-child"">TP53</i> mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.</li>
</ul>
Venclyxto in combination with a hypomethylating agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">Contraindications</b>

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is contraindicated. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors at initiation and during the dose-titration phase due to increased risk for tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). Concomitant use of preparations containing St. John's wort as Venclyxto efficacy may be reduced.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">Special Warnings &amp; Precautions for Use</b>

Tumour Lysis syndrome, including fatal events, has occurred in patients when treated with Venclyxto. For CLL and AML, please refer to the indication-specific recommendations for prevention of TLS in the Venclyxto summary of product characteristic (SmPC).

Patients should be assessed for risk and should receive appropriate prophylaxis, monitoring, and management for TLS. The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including comorbidities. Venclyxto poses a risk for TLS at initiation and during the dose-titration phase. Changes in electrolytes consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of Venclyxto and at each dose increase.

Neutropenia (grade 3 or 4) has been reported. Complete blood counts should be monitored throughout the treatment period.

In patients with AML, neutropenia (grade 3 or 4) is common before starting treatment. The neutrophil counts can worsen with Venetoclax in combination with a hypomethylating agent. Neutropenia can recur with subsequent cycles of therapy. Dose modification and interruptions for cytopenias are dependent on remission status.<br class=""first-child"" /><br class=""last-child"" />For CLL and AML, please refer to the indication-specific recommendations for dose modifications for toxicities in the Venclyxto SmPC.

Serious infections including sepsis with fatal outcome have been reported. Monitoring of any signs and symptoms of infection is required. Suspected infections should receive prompt treatment including antimicrobials and dose interruption or reduction as appropriate.

Live vaccines should not be administered during treatment or thereafter until B-cell recovery.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">Drug Interactions</b>

In CLL and AML CYP3A inhibitors may increase Venclyxto plasma concentrations.

In CLL, at initiation and dose-titration phase, strong CYP3A inhibitors are contraindicated due to increased risk for TLS and moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If moderate CYP3A inhibitors must be used, please refer to the recommendations for dose modifications in the Venclyxto SmPC.

In AML, please refer to the AML-specific recommendation for dose modifications for potential interactions with CYP3A inhibitors, in the Venclyxto SmPC.

Avoid concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors at initiation and during the dose titration phase.

CYP3A4 inducers may decrease Venclyxto plasma concentrations. Avoid coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. These agents may decrease venetoclax plasma concentrations.

Co-administration of bile acid sequestrants with VENCLYXTO is not recommended as this may reduce the absorption of VENCLYXTO.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">Adverse Reactions</b>

CLL

The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (&gt;=20%) of any grade in patients receiving venetoclax in the combination studies with obinutuzumab or rituximab were neutropenia, diarrhoea, and upper respiratory tract infection. In the monotherapy studies, the most common adverse reactions were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection.

The most frequently occurring serious adverse reactions (&gt;=2%) in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab were pneumonia, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, and TLS. In the monotherapy studies, the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (&gt;=2%) were pneumonia and febrile neutropenia.

Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients treated with venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab in the CLL14 and Murano studies, respectively. In the monotherapy studies with venetoclax, 11% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions.

Dosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with the combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab in CLL14, in 15% of patients treated with the combination of venetoclax and rituximab in Murano, and in 14% of patients treated with venetoclax in the monotherapy studies. The most common adverse reaction that led to dose interruptions was neutropenia.

AML

The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (&gt;=20%) of any grade in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with azacitidine or decitabine in the VIALE-A and M14-358, respectively, were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, anaemia, fatigue, pneumonia, hypokalaemia, and decreased appetite, haemorrhage, dizziness/syncope, hypotension, headache, abdominal pain, and anaemia.

The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (=5%) in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with azacitidine were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, sepsis and haemorrhage. In M14-358, the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (=5%) were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, bacteraemia and sepsis.

Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 24% of patients treated with venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in the VIALE-A study, and 26% of patients treated with venetoclax in combination with decitabine in the M14-358 study, respectively.

Dosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients in VIALE-A, and in 6 % of patients in M14-358. Venetoclax dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 72% and 65 % of patients, respectively. The most common adverse reaction that led to dose interruption (&gt;10%) of Venetoclax in VIALE-A, were febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, and thrombocytopenia. The most common adverse reactions that led to dose interruption (=5%) of venetoclax in M14-358 were febrile neutropenia, neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, pneumonia, platelet count decreased, and white blood cell count decreased.

<b class=""first-child"">Special</b><b class=""last-child""> Populations</b>

Patients with reduced renal function (CrCl &lt;80 mL/min) may require more intensive prophylaxis and monitoring to reduce the risk of TLS at initiation and during the dose-titration phase. Safety in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min) or on dialysis has not been established, and a recommended dose for these patients has not been determined.

For patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, a dose reduction of at least 50% throughout treatment is recommended.

Venclyxto may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise nursing women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 25, 2021-- Moderna, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced that the Phase 2/3 study of its COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) in adolescents has met its primary immunogenicity endpoint, successfully bridging immune responses to the adult vaccination. In the study, no cases of COVID-19 were observed in participants who had received two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine using the primary definition. In addition, a vaccine efficacy of 93% in seronegative participants was observed starting 14 days after the first dose using the secondary CDC case definition of COVID-19, which tested for milder disease. This study, known as the TeenCOVE study, enrolled more than 3,700 participants ages 12 to less than 18 years in the U.S. The Company plans to submit these data to regulators globally in early June.

“We are encouraged that mRNA-1273 was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 in adolescents. It is particularly exciting to see that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “We will submit these results to the U.S. FDA and regulators globally in early June and request authorization. We remain committed to doing our part to help end the COVID-19 pandemic.”

In this Phase 2/3 study, 3,732 adolescent participants ages 12 to less than 18 years were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to two 100 µg doses of mRNA-1273 or placebo. The primary endpoint of non-inferior immunogenicity versus the Phase 3 adult study comparator group was met. After two doses, no cases of COVID-19 were observed in the vaccine group using the case definition from the adult Phase 3 COVE study, compared to 4 cases in the placebo group, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 100% starting 14 days after the second dose. Because the incidence rate of COVID-19 is lower in adolescents, a secondary case definition based on the CDC definition of COVID-19 was also evaluated to include cases presenting with milder symptoms. Using the CDC definition, which requires only one COVID-19 symptom and a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or saliva sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, a vaccine efficacy of 93% after the first dose was observed.

mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated with a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent with the Phase 3 COVE study in adults. No significant safety concerns have been identified to date. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common solicited local adverse event was injection site pain. The most common solicited systemic adverse events after the second dose of mRNA-1273 were headache, fatigue, myalgia and chills.

Safety data continues to accrue, and the study continues to be monitored by an independent safety monitoring committee. All participants will be monitored for 12 months after their second injection to assess long-term protection and safety. Consequently, these data are subject to change based on ongoing data collection. The Company plans to submit data from the TeenCOVE study to a peer-reviewed publication.

<strong>About the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine</strong>

The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was co-developed by Moderna and investigators from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on February 24, 2020, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine was dosed on March 16, 2020, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing. On May 12, 2020, the U.S. FDA granted the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Fast Track designation. On May 29, 2020, the first participants in each age cohort were dosed in the Phase 2 study of the vaccine. On July 8, 2020, the Phase 2 study completed enrollment.

Results from the second interim analysis of the NIH-led Phase 1 study of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups were published on September 29, 2020 in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>. On November 30, 2020, Moderna announced the primary efficacy analysis of the Phase 3 study of the vaccine conducted on 196 cases. On November 30, 2020, the Company also announced that it filed for Emergency Use Authorization with the U.S. FDA and a Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) application with the European Medicines Agency. On December 18, 2020, the U.S. FDA authorized the emergency use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in individuals 18 years of age or older. Moderna has also received emergency (or other conditional, interim or provisional) authorization for use of its COVID-19 vaccine from health agencies in Canada, Israel, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Singapore, Qatar, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Paraguay, Japan, South Korea and an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization (WHO).

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is supporting the continued research and development of the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine development efforts with federal funding under contract no. 75A50120C00034. BARDA is reimbursing Moderna for 100 percent of the allowable costs incurred by the Company for conducting the program described in the BARDA contract. The U.S. government has agreed to purchase supply of mRNA-1273 under U.S. Department of Defense contract no. W911QY-20-C-0100.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","NEW YORK, May 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — TG Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TGTX), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) for ublituximab, the Company’s investigational glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, in combination with UKONIQ® (umbralisib), the Company’s once-daily, oral, inhibitor of PI3K-delta and CK1-epsilon, as a treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 25, 2022. The FDA also notified the Company that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application.

Michael S. Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TG Therapeutics stated, “We are extremely pleased that the ublituximab BLA has been accepted by the FDA. This is an important milestone for us as it brings us one step closer to our goal of providing a novel combination treatment option to patients with both treatment naive and relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL. We look forward to collaborating with the FDA throughout this review process.”

The BLA submission was based on the results of the UNITY-CLL trial, a global Phase 3 trial evaluating the combination of ublituximab plus UKONIQ (U2) compared to obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in patients with treatment naive and relapsed or refractory CLL. The U.S. FDA previously granted Fast Track designation to the combination of ublituximab and UKONIQ for the treatment of adult patients with CLL and orphan drug designation for ublituximab in combination with UKONIQ for the treatment of CLL.

ABOUT UNITY-CLL PHASE 3 TRIAL
UNITY-CLL is a global Phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the combination of ublituximab plus UKONIQ (umbralisib), or U2, to an active control arm of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in patients with both treatment-naïve and relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The trial randomized patients into four treatment arms: ublituximab single agent, UKONIQ single agent, ublituximab plus UKONIQ, and an active control arm of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. A prespecified interim analysis was conducted to assess the contribution of ublituximab and UKONIQ in the U2 combination arm and allowed for the termination of the single agent arms. Accordingly, the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 trial continued enrollment in a 1:1 ratio into the two combination arms: the investigational arm of U2 and the control arm of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. Approximately 420 subjects enrolled to the two combination arms and approximately 60% of patients were treatment-naïve and 40% were relapsed or refractory. The primary endpoint for this study was superior progression-free survival (PFS) for the U2 combination compared to the control arm. The trial met its primary endpoint and results were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2020. The UNITY-CLL Phase 3 trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

ABOUT CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of adult leukemia. It is estimated there will be more than 20,000 new cases of CLL diagnosed in the United States in 2020 and approximately 45,000 new cases globally in 2020.1,2 Although signs and symptoms of CLL may disappear for a period of time after initial treatment, the disease is considered incurable and many people will require additional treatment due to the return of malignant cells.

ABOUT FAST TRACK
Fast Track is a program designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that treat serious conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Filling an unmet medical need is defined as providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy that may be potentially better than available therapy.

A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for more frequent interactions with the FDA, priority review if relevant criteria are met, and rolling submission of the Biologics License Application or New Drug Application.

ABOUT ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION
Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA to drugs and biologics which are defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases/disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Orphan drug designation provides certain incentives which may include tax credits towards the cost of clinical trials and prescription drug user fee waivers. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity.

UKONIQ® is a registered trademark of TG Therapeutics, Inc.

ABOUT UKONIQ® (umbralisib)
UKONIQ is the first and only oral inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) delta and casein kinase 1 (CK1) epsilon. PI3K-delta is known to play an important role in supporting cell proliferation and survival, cell differentiation, intercellular trafficking and immunity and is expressed in both normal and malignant B-cells. CK1-epsilon is a regulator of oncoprotein translation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer cells, including lymphoid malignancies.

UKONIQ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based regimen and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least three prior lines of systemic therapy.

These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

IMPORANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Infections: Serious, including fatal, infections occurred in patients treated with UKONIQ. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 10% of 335 patients, with fatal infections occurring in <1% . The most frequent Grade =3 infections included pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infection. Provide prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and consider prophylactic antivirals during treatment with UKONIQ to prevent CMV infection, including CMV reactivation. Monitor for any new or worsening signs and symptoms of infection, including suspected PJP or CMV, during treatment with UKONIQ. For Grade 3 or 4 infection, withhold UKONIQ until infection has resolved. Resume UKONIQ at the same or a reduced dose. Withhold UKONIQ in patients with suspected PJP of any grade and permanently discontinue in patients with confirmed PJP. For clinical CMV infection or viremia, withhold UKONIQ until infection or viremia resolves. If UKONIQ is resumed, administer the same or reduced dose and monitor patients for CMV reactivation by PCR or antigen test at least monthly.

Neutropenia: Serious neutropenia occurred in patients treated with UKONIQ. Grade 3 neutropenia developed in 9% of 335 patients and Grade 4 neutropenia developed in 9%. Monitor neutrophil counts at least every 2 weeks for the first 2 months of UKONIQ and at least weekly in patients with neutrophil count <1 x 109/L (Grade 3-4) neutropenia during treatment with UKONIQ. Consider supportive care as appropriate. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue UKONIQ depending on the severity and persistence of neutropenia.

Diarrhea or Non-Infectious Colitis: Serious diarrhea or non-infectious colitis occurred in patients treated with UKONIQ. Any grade diarrhea or colitis occurred in 53% of 335 patients and Grade 3 occurred in 9%. For patients with severe diarrhea (Grade 3, i.e., > 6 stools per day over baseline) or abdominal pain, stool with mucus or blood, change in bowel habits, or peritoneal signs, withhold UKONIQ until resolved and provide supportive care with antidiarrheals or enteric acting steroids as appropriate. Upon resolution, resume UKONIQ at a reduced dose. For recurrent Grade 3 diarrhea or recurrent colitis of any grade, discontinue UKONIQ. Discontinue UKONIQ for life-threatening diarrhea or colitis.

Hepatotoxicity: Serious hepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with UKONIQ. Grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevations (ALT and/or AST) occurred in 8% and <1%, respectively, in 335 patients. Monitor hepatic function at baseline and during treatment with UKONIQ. For ALT/AST greater than 5 to less than 20 times ULN, withhold UKONIQ until return to less than 3 times ULN, then resume at a reduced dose. For ALT/AST elevation greater than 20 times ULN, discontinue UKONIQ.

Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Severe cutaneous reactions, including a fatal case of exfoliative dermatitis, occurred in patients treated with UKONIQ. Grade 3 cutaneous reactions occurred in 2% of 335 patients and included exfoliative dermatitis, erythema, and rash (primarily maculo-papular). Monitor patients for new or worsening cutaneous reactions. Review all concomitant medications and discontinue any potentially contributing medications. Withhold UKONIQ for severe (Grade 3) cutaneous reactions until resolution. Monitor at least weekly until resolved. Upon resolution, resume UKONIQ at a reduced dose. Discontinue UKONIQ if severe cutaneous reaction does not improve, worsens, or recurs. Discontinue UKONIQ for life-threatening cutaneous reactions or SJS, TEN, or DRESS of any grade. Provide supportive care as appropriate.

Allergic Reactions Due to Inactive Ingredient FD&C Yellow No. 5: UKONIQ contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine), which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons, frequently in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.

Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, UKONIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18% of 221 patients who received UKONIQ. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in =2% of patients were diarrhea-colitis (4%), pneumonia (3%), sepsis (2%), and urinary tract infection (2%). Permanent discontinuation of UKONIQ due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of patients. Dose reductions of UKONIQ due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients. Dosage interruptions of UKONIQ due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients.

The most common adverse reactions (>15%), including laboratory abnormalities, in 221 patients who received UKONIQ were increased creatinine (79%), diarrhea-colitis (58%, 2%), fatigue (41%), nausea (38%), neutropenia (33%), ALT increase (33%), AST increase (32%), musculoskeletal pain (27%), anemia (27%), thrombocytopenia (26%), upper respiratory tract infection (21%), vomiting (21%), abdominal pain (19%), decreased appetite (19%), and rash (18%).

Lactation: Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from umbralisib in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with UKONIQ and for at least one month after the last dose.

GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for sotrovimab (previously VIR-7831), an investigational single-dose monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and paediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalisation or death.

<strong>Adrienne E. Shapiro, M.D., Ph.D., </strong><strong>an infectious disease specialist at </strong><strong>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and investigator in the COMET-ICE trial, said:</strong> “Monoclonal antibodies like sotrovimab are potentially one of our most effective tools for fighting COVID-19. While preventive measures, including vaccines, can reduce the total number of cases, sotrovimab is an important treatment option for those who become ill with COVID-19 and are at high risk – allowing them to avoid hospitalisation or worse.”

<strong>George Scangos, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vir, said:</strong> “Our distinctive scientific approach has led to a single monoclonal antibody that, based on an interim analysis, resulted in an 85% reduction in all-cause hospitalisations or death, and has demonstrated, in vitro, that it retains activity against all known variants of concern, including the emerging variant from India. I believe that sotrovimab is a critical new treatment option in the fight against the current pandemic and potentially for future coronavirus outbreaks, as well. At Vir, our aim is not only to deliver a clinically effective therapy for COVID-19, but also to provide effective therapy against SARS-CoV-2 variants and potential pandemics of tomorrow.”

<strong>Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&amp;D, GSK, said: </strong>“The fast pace of COVID-19 vaccinations in the U.S. is encouraging, yet, despite these aggressive efforts, there is still a need to help prevent infected patients from developing complications. In just over a year since starting our collaboration and in less than 10 months since beginning clinical trials, we are delighted that, as of today, the benefits of this unique monoclonal antibody will now be available to patients in need.”

Sotrovimab has been granted an EUA by the FDA to facilitate the availability and use of this investigational monoclonal antibody for the treatment of COVID-19 in the U.S. while the pandemic remains a public health emergency. The <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/149534/download"">FDA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers</a> regarding the emergency use of sotrovimab reflects the recently updated definition of high risk for COVID-19 to include additional medical conditions and factors associated with increased risk for progression to severe disease. The EUA for sotrovimab also includes post-authorisation commitments as specified in the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/149532/download"">Letter of Authorization</a>.

Sotrovimab is continuing to be studied in ongoing clinical trials. An analysis of safety and efficacy data at day 29 for the full population from the COMET-ICE trial is expected as early as the first half of 2021. GSK and Vir plan to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA in the second half of 2021.
<h2><strong>Evidence of Sotrovimab’s Profound Clinical Efficacy</strong></h2>
The EUA was granted to sotrovimab based on an interim analysis of efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial – Intent to Care Early) trial in high-risk adult outpatients, which was stopped early by an independent data monitoring committee in March 2021 due to evidence of profound clinical efficacy. As previously announced, interim study results demonstrated an 85% (p=0.002) reduction in hospitalisation for more than 24 hours or death in those receiving sotrovimab compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. The most common adverse events observed in the sotrovimab treatment group in COMET-ICE were rash (2%) and diarrhoea (1%), all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate). No other treatment-emergent adverse events were reported at a higher rate with sotrovimab compared to placebo. The EUA includes a warning for hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions.
<h2><strong>In Vitro Data Indicate Sotrovimab Maintains Activity Against All Known Variants of Concern</strong></h2>
Sotrovimab targets a conserved epitope of the spike protein that is less likely to mutate over time. The EUA submission also included data from published in vitro studies, which demonstrated that sotrovimab maintains activity against all known circulating variants of concern, including the variants from Brazil (P.1), California (B.1.427/B.1.429), India (B.1.617), New York (B.1.526), South Africa (B.1.351) and the UK (B.1.1.7). GSK and Vir will continue to evaluate the ability of sotrovimab to maintain activity against new and emerging variants. The clinical impact of these in vitro variant data is not yet known. Data collection and analysis is still ongoing.
<h2><strong>GSK and Vir’s Commitment to Patient Access to Sotrovimab</strong></h2>
GSK and Vir are actively working with government agencies around the world to make sotrovimab available to patients in need of treatment.
<ul>
 	<li>On 21 May 2021, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) issued a positive scientific opinion following the referral of sotrovimab to the CHMP under Article 5(3) of Regulation 726/2004. The opinion relates to the use of sotrovimab for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and over and weighing at least 40 kg) with COVID-19 who do not require oxygen supplementation and who are at risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.</li>
 	<li>The EMA has also started a rolling review of data on sotrovimab that will continue until enough evidence is available to support the filing of a formal marketing authorisation application.</li>
 	<li>In April, Health Canada initiated a review of sotrovimab under the expedited Interim Order application pathway for COVID-19 drugs.</li>
 	<li>GSK and Vir are continuing discussions with other global regulators on the regulatory pathways available so that sotrovimab can be made available to patients with COVID-19 as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>About the COMET-ICE Study Design</strong></h2>
The multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 COMET-ICE trial investigated intravenous (IV) infusion of sotrovimab in adults with mild or moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression to severe disease.

This ongoing trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single IV infusion of sotrovimab (500 mg) or placebo in non-hospitalised participants globally. The safety of sotrovimab is primarily based on an interim analysis from 868 patients (430 patients in the treatment arm and 438 in the placebo arm) through day 15. Among those studied, 63% were Hispanic or Latino and 7% were Black or African American. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these populations are approximately three times more likely to be hospitalised and approximately two times more likely to die of COVID-19<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-and-vir-biotechnology-announce-sotrovimab-vir-7831-receives-emergency-use-authorization-from-the-us-fda/#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1""><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who have progression of COVID-19 as defined by the need for hospitalisation for greater than 24 hours for acute management of illness or death.

In March 2021, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the COMET-ICE trial be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy.
<h2><strong>About the Sotrovimab Clinical Development Program</strong></h2>
In addition to the COMET-ICE trial, the full COMET clinical development program for sotrovimab includes:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>COMET-PEAK</strong>: An ongoing Phase 2 trial with two parts: to compare the safety and viral kinetics of 500 mg intramuscularly (IM) administered sotrovimab to 500 mg intravenously administered sotrovimab among low-risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 and to evaluate the similarity in pharmacokinetics between sotrovimab manufactured by different processes</li>
 	<li><strong>COMET-TAIL</strong>: A Phase 3 trial expected to begin in the second quarter of 2021 as an early treatment for COVID-19 in high-risk adults, to assess whether IM-administered sotrovimab can reduce hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19</li>
 	<li><strong>COMET-STAR</strong>: A Phase 3 trial expected to begin in the second half of 2021 in uninfected adults at high risk to determine whether IM-administered sotrovimab can prevent symptomatic infection.</li>
</ul>
Sotrovimab was also evaluated in the outpatient setting in BLAZE-4, a Phase 2 trial sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company, designed to assess the safety and efficacy of bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) alone and bamlanivimab with other neutralising antibodies, including sotrovimab, versus placebo in low-risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. An interim analysis found that bamlanivimab (700 mg) co-administered with sotrovimab (500 mg) demonstrated a 70% relative reduction in patients with persistently high viral load at day 7 compared to placebo, meeting the primary endpoint.

Additionally, sotrovimab, along with VIR-7832 is being evaluated in the Phase 1b/2a National Health Service-supported AGILE trial in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. VIR-7832 is the second monoclonal antibody from the Vir-GSK collaboration to be investigated as a potential COVID-19 treatment.
<h2><strong>About Sotrovimab (previously VIR-7831)</strong></h2>
Sotrovimab is an investigational SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. Sotrovimab, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend™ technology, also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life.
<h2><strong>About VIR-7832 / GSK4182137</strong></h2>
VIR-7832 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and an enhanced ability to clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7832, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend and other Fc technologies, has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life. Importantly, VIR-7832 also has been engineered to potentially enhance virus-specific T cell function, which could help treat and/or prevent COVID-19 infection.

The following is a summary of information for sotrovimab. Healthcare providers should review the Fact Sheets for information on the authorized use of sotrovimab and mandatory requirements of the EUA. Please see the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/149532/download"">FDA Letter of Authorization</a>, <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/149534/download"">Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers</a>, and <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/149533/download"">Fact Sheet for Patients, Parents, and Caregivers</a>.
<h2><strong>Important Information about Sotrovimab</strong></h2>
Sotrovimab has been authorized by the FDA for the emergency use described below. Sotrovimab is not FDA-approved for this use.

Sotrovimab is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of sotrovimab under section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.
<h3><strong>Authorized Use </strong></h3>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to permit the emergency use of the unapproved product sotrovimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.
<h3><strong>Limitations of Authorized Use </strong></h3>
Sotrovimab is not authorized for use in patients:
<ul>
 	<li>who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR</li>
 	<li>who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR</li>
 	<li>who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 (in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity).</li>
</ul>
Benefit of treatment with sotrovimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation.
<h2><strong>Important Safety Information for Sotrovimab</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Warnings</strong></h3>
There are limited clinical data available for sotrovimab. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with use of sotrovimab.

<u>Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis and Infusion-Related Reactions</u>

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed with administration of sotrovimab. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

Infusion-related reactions, occurring during the infusion and up to 24 hours after the infusion, have been observed with administration of sotrovimab. These reactions may be severe or life threatening. Signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions may include: fever, difficulty breathing, reduced oxygen saturation, chills, fatigue, arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia), chest pain or discomfort, weakness, altered mental status, nausea, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, vaso-vagal reactions (e.g., pre-syncope, syncope), dizziness and diaphoresis.

Consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care if an infusion-related reaction occurs.

Hypersensitivity reactions occurring more than 24 hours after the infusion have also been reported with the use of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies under Emergency Use Authorization.

<u>Clinical Worsening After SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibody Administration</u>

Clinical worsening of COVID-19 after administration of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment has been reported and may include signs or symptoms of fever, hypoxia or increased respiratory difficulty, arrythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), fatigue, and altered mental status. Some of these events required hospitalization. It is not known if these events were related to SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody use or were due to progression of COVID-19.

<u>Limitations of Benefit and Potential for Risk in Patients with Severe COVID-19</u>

Benefit of treatment with sotrovimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Therefore, sotrovimab is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity.

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events observed in the sotrovimab treatment group in COMET-ICE were rash (2%) and diarrhea (1%), all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate). No other treatment-emergent adverse events were reported at a higher rate with sotrovimab compared to placebo.
<h3><strong>Use in Specific Populations</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Pregnancy</strong></h3>
There are insufficient data to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcome. Sotrovimab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.
<h3><strong>Lactation</strong></h3>
There are no available data on the presence of sotrovimab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Individuals with COVID-19 who are breastfeeding should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.
<h2><strong>About the Vir and GSK Collaboration</strong></h2>
In April 2020, Vir and GSK entered into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The collaboration uses Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies will leverage GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They will also apply their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.
<h2><strong>GSK Commitment to Tackling COVID-19</strong></h2>
GSK’s response to COVID-19 has been one of the broadest in the industry, with three potential treatments in addition to our vaccine candidates in development with partner organisations.

GSK is collaborating with several organisations on COVID-19 vaccines by providing access to our adjuvant technology. In addition to our work with Medicago, we recently announced positive Phase 2 data from our collaboration with Sanofi to develop an adjuvanted, protein-based vaccine candidate and expect to begin a Phase 3 trial in Q2. An earlier stage collaboration with SK Bioscience is also ongoing. SK Bioscience receives funding from CEPI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop differentiated, affordable COVID-19 vaccines for supply globally through the COVAX facility. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and contributing to protecting more people. Based on experience with other adjuvanted vaccines, there is potential for increased cross protection against COVID-19 variants which will be further studied.

GSK is also working with mRNA specialist, CureVac, to jointly develop next generation, multi-valent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 with the potential to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine. GSK will also support manufacturing of up to 100m doses of CureVac’s first generation COVID-19 vaccine. GSK is also providing manufacturing support for up to 60m doses of Novavax’ COVID-19 vaccine in the UK.

GSK is also exploring potential therapeutic or treatment options for COVID-19 patients. We are collaborating with Vir Biotechnology to develop existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options for COVID-19. We recently reported that an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the Phase 3 COMET-ICE trial evaluating sotrovimab as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalisation be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy, based on an interim analysis of data from the trial. We have received Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. and are seeking authorisations in other countries. We are also assessing whether an investigational monoclonal antibody, otilimab, can help severely ill COVID-19 patients aged over 70 who experience an overreaction of their immune system.
<h2><strong>Vir’s Commitment to COVID-19</strong></h2>
Vir was founded with the mission of addressing the world’s most serious infectious diseases. In 2020, Vir responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging our unique scientific insights and industry-leading antibody platform to explore multiple monoclonal antibodies as potential therapeutic or preventive options for COVID-19. Sotrovimab is the first SARS-CoV-2-targeting antibody Vir advanced into the clinic. It was carefully selected for its demonstrated promise in preclinical research, including an anticipated high barrier to resistance and potential ability to both block the virus from entering healthy cells and clear infected cells. Vir is continuing to pursue novel therapeutic and prophylactic solutions to combat SARS-CoV-2 and future coronavirus pandemics, both independently and in collaboration with its partners.

BASEL, Switzerland and NEW YORK, May 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Myovant Sciences (NYSE: MYOV) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved MYFEMBREE<sup>®</sup> (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg), the first once-daily treatment for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women, with a treatment duration of up to 24 months. The approval is supported by efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies, which were published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Under the terms of their previously announced collaboration, Myovant and Pfizer will jointly commercialize MYFEMBREE in the U.S. MYFEMBREE is expected to be available in June 2021.

“With MYFEMBREE, we can offer women with uterine fibroids a non-invasive treatment that provides clinically meaningful symptom relief for heavy menstrual bleeding with one pill, once-a-day,” said Ayman Al-Hendy, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Chicago, and LIBERTY Program Steering Committee Member. “The FDA approval of MYFEMBREE represents a significant milestone in expanding treatment options for uterine fibroids, a chronic and debilitating disease for many women in the U.S.”

“Uterine fibroids affect millions of women in the U.S. and account for over 250,000 hysterectomies each year, with heavy menstrual bleeding being one of the most bothersome symptoms,” said David Marek, Chief Executive Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc. “The approval of MYFEMBREE represents the second FDA product approval for Myovant in less than one year. This is an important step forward as we seek to redefine care for women and for men, not only through new medicines but through continued collaboration with the community.”

“MYFEMBREE’s approval is a testament to the shared commitment between Myovant and Pfizer to support women living with uterine fibroids,” said Nick Lagunowich, Global President, Internal Medicine at Pfizer. “We are excited to offer this new treatment option which will help provide much needed symptom relief with the convenience of an oral, once-daily tablet.”

The Phase 3 LIBERTY studies each met the primary endpoint, with 72.1% and 71.2% of women in the MYFEMBREE groups achieving the responder criteria compared with 16.8% and 14.7% of women in the placebo groups at Week 24, respectively (both p &lt; 0.0001). A response was defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of treatment measured using the alkaline hematin method. Women receiving MYFEMBREE experienced reductions of 82.0% and 84.3% in menstrual blood loss from baselines, respectively (both p &lt; 0.0001 compared to placebo). Adverse reactions occurring in at least 3% of women treated with MYFEMBREE and at a greater incidence than placebo were hot flush, abnormal uterine bleeding, alopecia, and decreased libido. There were no pregnancies reported in the MYFEMBREE groups in either study.

<strong>About Uterine Fibroids</strong>
Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop in or on the muscular walls of the uterus and are among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women. In addition to an individual's genetic predisposition, estrogens are well known to play an important role in the regulation of fibroid growth.

Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors, they can cause debilitating symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding (frequently resulting in anemia and fatigue), pain (including painful periods, abdominal pain, painful intercourse, backache), increased abdominal girth and bloating, urinary frequency or retention, constipation, pregnancy loss, and, in some cases, infertility. These symptoms can also lead to loss of productivity at work, limitations in normal activities of daily living, and social embarrassment.

An estimated five million women in the U.S. suffer from symptoms of uterine fibroids, and an estimated three million women are inadequately treated by current medical therapy and require further treatment.

<strong>About MYFEMBREE</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup>
MYFEMBREE (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) is the first once-daily treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a treatment duration of up to 24 months. MYFEMBREE contains relugolix, which reduces the amount of estrogen (and other hormones) produced by ovaries, estradiol (an estrogen) which may reduce the risk of bone loss, and norethindrone acetate (a progestin) which is necessary when women with a uterus (womb) take estrogen.

<strong>Indications and Usage</strong>

MYFEMBREE is indicated for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) in premenopausal women. <u>Limitations of Use</u>: Use of MYFEMBREE should be limited to 24 months due to the risk of continued bone loss which may not be reversible.

<strong>Important Safety Information</strong>

<strong>BOXED WARNING: THROMBOEMBOLIC DISORDERS AND VASCULAR EVENTS</strong>

<strong>Estrogen and progestin combination products, including MYFEMBREE, increase the risk of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke and myocardial infarction, especially in women at increased risk for these events.</strong>

<strong>MYFEMBREE is contraindicated in women with current or a history of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders and in women at increased risk for these events, including women over 35 years of age who smoke or women with uncontrolled hypertension.</strong>

<strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS</strong>

MYFEMBREE is contraindicated in women with any of the following: high risk of arterial, venous thrombotic, or thromboembolic disorder; pregnancy; known osteoporosis; current or history of breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive malignancies; known hepatic impairment or disease; undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding; known hypersensitivity to components of MYFEMBREE.

<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>

<strong>Thromboembolic Disorders: </strong>Discontinue immediately if an arterial or venous thrombotic, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular event occurs or is suspected. Discontinue at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization, if feasible. Discontinue immediately if there is sudden unexplained partial or complete loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions and evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis as these have been reported with estrogens and progestins.

<strong>Bone Loss: </strong>MYFEMBREE may cause a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients, which may be greater with increasing duration of use and may not be completely reversible after stopping treatment. Consider the benefits and risks in patients with a history of low trauma fracture or risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss, including medications that may decrease BMD. Assessment of BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is recommended at baseline and periodically thereafter. Consider discontinuing MYFEMBREE if the risk of bone loss exceeds the potential benefit.

<strong>Hormone-Sensitive Malignancies: </strong>Discontinue MYFEMBREE if a hormone-sensitive malignancy is diagnosed. Surveillance measures in accordance with standard of care, such as breast examinations and mammography are recommended. Use of estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin has resulted in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

<strong>Depression, Mood Disorders, and Suicidal Ideation: </strong>Promptly evaluate patients with mood changes and depressive symptoms including shortly after initiating treatment, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits. Patients with new or worsening depression, anxiety, or other mood changes should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention for suicidal ideation and behavior and reevaluate the benefits and risks of continuing MYFEMBREE.

<strong>Hepatic Impairment and Transaminase Elevations: </strong>Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in these patients. Instruct women to promptly seek medical attention for symptoms or signs that may reflect liver injury, such as jaundice or right upper abdominal pain. Acute liver test abnormalities may necessitate the discontinuation of MYFEMBREE use until the liver tests return to normal and MYFEMBREE causation has been excluded.

<strong>Gallbladder Disease or History of Cholestatic Jaundice: </strong>Discontinue MYFEMBREE if signs or symptoms of gallbladder disease or jaundice occur. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, assess the risk-benefit of continuing therapy. Studies among estrogen users suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease.

<strong>Elevated Blood Pressure: </strong>For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop MYFEMBREE if blood pressure rises significantly.

<strong>Change in Menstrual Bleeding Pattern and Reduced Ability to Recognize Pregnancy: </strong>Advise women to use non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for one week after discontinuing MYFEMBREE. Avoid concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives. MYFEMBREE may delay the ability to recognize pregnancy because it alters menstrual bleeding. Perform testing if pregnancy is suspected and discontinue MYFEMBREE if pregnancy is confirmed.

<strong>Risk of Early Pregnancy Loss: </strong>MYFEMBREE can cause early pregnancy loss. Exclude pregnancy before initiating and advise women to use effective non-hormonal contraception.

<strong>Uterine Fibroid Prolapse or Expulsion: </strong>Advise women with known or suspected submucosal uterine fibroids about the possibility of uterine fibroid prolapse or expulsion and instruct them to contact their physician if severe bleeding and/or cramping occurs.

<strong>Alopecia:</strong> Alopecia, hair loss, and hair thinning were reported in phase 3 trials with MYFEMBREE. Consider discontinuing MYFEMBREE if hair loss becomes a concern. Whether the hair loss is reversible is unknown.

<strong>Effects on Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism: </strong>More frequent monitoring in MYFEMBREE-treated women with prediabetes and diabetes may be necessary. MYFEMBREE may decrease glucose tolerance and result in increased blood glucose concentrations. Monitor lipid levels and consider discontinuing if hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia worsens<em>. </em>In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations in triglycerides levels leading to pancreatitis. Use of MYFEMBREE is associated with increases in total cholesterol and LDL-C.

<strong>Effect on Other Laboratory Results: </strong>Patients with hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism may require higher doses of thyroid hormone or cortisol replacement therapy. Use of estrogen and progestin combinations may raise serum concentrations of binding proteins (e.g., thyroid-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin), which may reduce free thyroid or corticosteroid hormone levels. Use of estrogen and progestin may also affect the levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, and coagulation factors.

<strong>Hypersensitivity Reactions: </strong>Immediately discontinue MYFEMBREE if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs.

<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>
Most common adverse reactions for MYFEMBREE (incidence =3% and greater than placebo) were hot flush/hyperhidrosis/night sweats, abnormal uterine bleeding, alopecia, and decreased libido. These are not all the possible side effects of MYFEMBREE.

<strong>DRUG INTERACTIONS</strong>
<strong>P-gp Inhibitors:</strong> Avoid use of MYFEMBREE with oral P-gp inhibitors. If use is unavoidable, take MYFEMBREE first, separate dosing by at least 6 hours, and monitor patients for adverse reactions.

<strong>Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers: </strong>Avoid use of MYFEMBREE with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers.

<strong>LACTATION</strong>
Advise women not to breastfeed while taking MYFEMBREE.

<p align=""justify""><strong>PARIS</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>LONDON –</strong><strong> May 27, 2021 </strong>– Today, Sanofi and GSK started enrollment in their Phase 3 clinical study to assess the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of their adjuvanted recombinant-protein COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The global, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 study will include more than 35,000 volunteers aged 18 and older from several countries, including sites in the US, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The primary endpoint of the study is the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 naïve adults, with secondary endpoints being the prevention of severe COVID-19 disease and prevention of asymptomatic infection. In a two-stage approach, the study will initially investigate the efficacy of a vaccine formulation targeting the original D.614 virus (Wuhan), while a second stage will evaluate a second formulation targeting the B.1.351 (South African) variant. Recent scientific evidence<sup>1</sup> shows that antibodies created against the B.1.351 variant may provide broad cross-protection against other more transmissible variants. The design of the Phase 3, conducted across a broad diversity of geographies, also allows evaluation of the efficacy of the candidate against a variety of circulating variants.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Following encouraging interim results from the recent Phase 2 study, the companies will also begin clinical studies in the coming weeks to assess the ability of the adjuvanted recombinant-protein COVID-19 vaccine candidate to generate a strong booster response regardless of initial vaccine platform received.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“</em><em>We are encouraged to</em><em> see </em><em>first vaccinations </em><em>starting to take place </em><em>in </em><em>such an important, pivotal </em><em>P</em><em>hase 3 </em><em>study</em><em>, </em><em>as</em> <em>we </em><em>believe</em><em> that our </em><em>unique technology platform</em><em> will provide a </em><em>clinically-relevant</em><em> vaccine option</em><em>”</em> said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur. <em>“</em><em>W</em><em>e have adapted our </em><em>vaccine </em><em>development strategy based on forward-looking considerations as the virus continues to evolve, as well as anticipating what may be needed in </em><em>a </em><em>post-pandemic setting</em><em>.</em><em> This trial is testament </em><em>to</em> <em>the</em> <em>urgency and agility </em><em>in our approach to help overcome the ongoing </em><em>impact</em><em> of this pandemic.</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added, <em>“We believe further solutions for COVID-19 are very much needed to help reach people around the world, especially as the pandemic evolves and variants continue to emerge. Adjusting our technology and study designs reflects this need and will further build the potential of this adjuvanted protein-based vaccine. We are grateful to the volunteers who will take part in the trials and hope the results will </em><em>add</em> <em>to</em> <em>the encouraging data we’ve seen so far so we can make the vaccine available as quickly as possible.”</em></p>

<strong>Basel, May 27, 2021</strong> — Novartis and Molecular Partners announced today the start of the clinical trial EMPATHY, a Phase 2 and 3 study, to explore the use of its novel DARPin<sup>®</sup> therapeutic candidate ensovibep (MP0420) for the treatment of COVID-19. Novartis will conduct the clinical trial program for ensovibep, with Molecular Partners as sponsor of the studies. In March 2021, Molecular Partners reported positive initial Phase 1 results in healthy volunteers.

The EMPATHY clinical trial program is investigating the safety and efficacy of ensovibep in patients with COVID-19, who are in the early stages of infection, to prevent worsening symptoms and hospitalization. The study will enroll 400 patients in Phase 2 to identify a dose with optimal safety and activity, with initial results anticipated in August 2021. At that point Phase 3 will move ahead with an additional 1,700 patients with results anticipated in H1 2022. If the initial EMPATHY trial results are convincing, this would pave the way for Novartis to seek expedited approval via the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

Those eligible for the EMPATHY trial are adults, over the age of 18, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and who are experiencing at least two pre-determined mild/moderate symptoms of COVID-19 within 7 days of their diagnosis.

“Novartis remains unwavering in our efforts to help combat COVID-19, including our support to deliver treatment options for patients around the globe,” said Dr. Lutz Hegemann, Group Head, Corporate Affairs and Global Health, Novartis. “Today, with Molecular Partners, we’re announcing an important next step in the development of ensovibep, which holds promise to respond to breakthrough disease and new variants in the future. We are hopeful the results of this clinical trial program will provide a reliable treatment option for patients with COVID-19.”

Novartis believes a multi-solution strategy is needed to overcome COVID-19, one that utilizes a range of diagnostic and therapeutic options, depending on the needs of individual patients. Every country should have access to effective medicines to treat COVID-19 and despite availability of vaccinations, there continues to be disease transmission and there is likely to continue to be breakthrough disease.

“By virtue of its tri-specific design, ensovibep was built to resist viral mutations and indeed shows potent inhibition of all variants of concern to date, with the potential to maintain activity also for future variants. This type of broad spectrum activity is essential for any treatment of relevance for patients with COVID-19,” said Patrick Amstutz, Chief Executive Officer, Molecular Partners. “Reaching this important clinical milestone is not only a key step to combat this virus, but also validating our DARPin approach to generate multispecific antiviral therapies in the fight against global pandemics.”

Initial findings from the Phase 1 trial of ensovibep showed it to be safe and well tolerated with no significant adverse events. Predictable exposure was seen post-administration, confirming the expected half-life of two to three weeks. These data confirmed the systemic administration of a multi-specific DARPin<sup>?</sup> antiviral therapy to be safe and well tolerated and support plans for additional clinical work in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, as part of the EMPATHY trial. The preclinical work for MP0423 is still ongoing and is being led by Molecular Partners.

<strong>Sustained binding against new variants of Covid-19</strong>
Molecular Partners, in collaboration with academic and government partners, has conducted <em>in vitro</em> experiments using pseudovirion models of SARS-CoV-2 to analyze for infectivity in the presence of ensovibep. These models represent new variants first identified in UK (B1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), Brazil (P.1), California (B.1.429), New York (B.1.526), emerging variants R.1 and A.23.1, the individual key mutations of the variants identified in India, B.1.617 and B.1.618, and other key spike mutations identified to date. The results suggest ensovibep continues to retain full potency against the new viral variants of SARS-CoV-2, and could have the potential for sustained binding to additional COVID-19 variants, as they may appear in the future.

<strong>Ensovibep enrollment in ACTIV-3 trial</strong>
Molecular Partners and Novartis also recently announced the inclusion of ensovibep in the NIH-Sponsored ACTIV-3 Trial (National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) program) that aims to prioritize and push forward development of the most promising COVID-19 therapies. ACTIV-3 is a global Phase 3 trial that will investigate the safety and efficacy of ensovibep in adults hospitalized with COVID-19, with an aim to enroll up to 1,000 patients. The first patient dose is expected to be administered in June 2021, with an interim analysis after 300 patients with mild-to-moderate disease. These patients will receive either ensovibep or a placebo. Trial participants will also receive an existing standard of care for COVID-19, including the FDA-approved antiviral remdesivir. If the treatment has a positive risk-benefit profile, the study will enroll an additional 700 patients for further testing. Ensovibep is the first non-antibody therapy assessed in ACTIV-3, supporting a different approach for COVID-19 treatment.

<strong>The collaboration with Molecular Partners</strong>
Novartis is proud to be collaborating with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin<sup>®</sup> therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19, ensovibep and MP0423, with an option to in-license global rights from Molecular Partners and development responsibilities to both therapies. Novartis will also be responsible for manufacturing, distribution and commercialization of both therapies.

The development program will be led by Molecular Partners until Phase 1 is complete and will be handed over to Novartis to conduct the pivotal clinical trial EMPATHY, with Phase 2 and 3 trials, with Molecular Partners as sponsor of these trials. Molecular Partners will perform all remaining preclinical work for MP0423.

<strong>Novartis response to the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>
Novartis is making a number of contributions to the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and supporting the stability of global health systems. The company recently announced initial agreements to provide manufacturing capacity for a COVID-19 vaccination for BioNtech at its site in Stein, Switzerland and for CureVac in Kundl, Austria. In addition, Novartis has signed an initial agreement to reserve capacity and implement the technology transfer for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Roche’s Actemra/RoActemra. Novartis is committed to donating US $40 million to help communities affected by the pandemic around the world.

In addition, Novartis is active in several key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). Novartis has also announced this collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin<sup>®</sup> therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19. The company is separately supporting COVID-19-related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. In our labs, we have started a collaborative, longer-term drug discovery effort to develop the first oral medicines for COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low-and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is available. Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID8.

Under the terms of the agreement, Senti Bio will be responsible for designing, building and testing cell state- and disease- specific Smart Sensors and Regulator Dials for use in BlueRock Therapeutics’ regenerative medicine product candidates. BlueRock Therapeutics will receive the option to license gene circuits emerging from the collaboration for cell therapy products in specified indications. Upon option exercise, BlueRock Therapeutics will be responsible for conducting preclinical, clinical and commercialization activities for any cell therapy candidates that incorporate Senti Bio’s licensed gene circuits.

“There is tremendous opportunity at the intersection of cell, gene and systems biology. With control of all three axes, we believe we can further engineer the cell’s inherent potential to integrate multiple physiologic inputs to produce powerful therapeutic benefit <em>in vivo</em>,” said Emile Nuwaysir, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of BlueRock. “We are excited to bring together Senti Bio’s expertise in gene circuits with BlueRock’s deep understanding of engineered cells to enhance the efficacy, precision, and control of BlueRock’s future cell therapy products.”

Through this collaboration, Senti Bio will seek to bolster BlueRock’s <em>cell+gene</em> platform by developing gene circuits to precisely control cell differentiation and therapeutic payload expression, in an effort to accelerate BlueRock’s efforts to create next-generation cellular therapies, and further consolidate Bayer’s strategy in cell and gene therapies. It is a step forward in BlueRock and Bayer’s ambition to be at the forefront of innovation in cell and gene therapies, pioneering technology to offer the safest, highest quality and most efficient options for patients.

Tim Lu, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Senti Bio commented, “We are engineering gene circuits to reprogram cells with biological logic to sense inputs, compute decisions and respond to their cellular environments. By combining BlueRock’s iPSC platform with our sophisticated gene circuits, we believe that we have the potential to create the next generation of programmable regenerative medicines together.”

Senti Bio is developing proprietary engineered gene circuits designed to reprogram cells to sense inputs, compute decisions and respond with outputs. The company’s four core categories of gene circuits in development include Smart Sensors, Logic Gating, Regulator Dials and Multi-Arming, each of which is designed to confer greater efficacy, precision and control to cell and gene therapies. These gene circuits are driving Senti Bio’s oncology-focused therapeutics pipeline and enable potential collaborations involving other cell and gene therapies.

BlueRock Therapeutics develops engineered cell therapies using a proprietary <em>cell+gene</em> platform. Genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a highly consistent and unlimited source for allogeneic cell therapies. These cells can be differentiated into a wide variety of therapeutic cell types to potentially treat diseases across neurology, cardiology and immunology indications, as well as others. BlueRock Therapeutics plans to apply Senti Bio’s Smart Sensor and Regulator Dial gene circuit technology platform towards the goal of developing highly sophisticated engineered cell therapies.

<strong>About Smart Sensors and Regulator Dials</strong>
Smart Sensors are gene circuits designed to precisely detect cell type or disease environments, and thus distinguish between the “disease state” and “healthy state.” For example, Smart Sensors can be engineered to detect whether certain conditions, or disease biomarkers, are present before countering with a specific therapeutic response. These Smart Sensors include synthetic promoters, which are compact DNA sequences engineered to more precisely regulate the expression of genes. Conventional medicines are generally unable to dynamically change their behavior in response to cell- or disease-specific conditions.

Regulator Dials are gene circuits designed to enable the precise tuning of therapeutic activity from a cell or gene therapy product. For example, Regulator Dials can be engineered to regulate therapeutic payload expression in response to varying concentrations of FDA-approved drugs. Regulator Dials are expected to enable the exogenous regulation of next-generation cell and gene therapies even after they have been delivered <em>in vivo</em>. Most existing cell and gene therapies cannot be modulated once they have been delivered into patients.

<strong>About Senti Bio</strong>
Our mission is to create a new generation of smarter medicines that outmaneuver complex diseases in ways previously inconceivable. To accomplish this mission, we are building a synthetic biology platform that we believe may enable us to program next-generation cell and gene therapies with what we refer to as “gene circuits.” These gene circuits, which are created from novel and proprietary combinations of DNA sequences, are designed to reprogram cells with biological logic to sense inputs, compute decisions and respond to their cellular environments. We aim to design gene circuits to improve the “intelligence” of cell and gene therapies in order to enhance their therapeutic effectiveness against a broad range of diseases that conventional medicines do not readily address.

LEXINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: DRNA) (the “Company” or “Dicerna”), a leading developer of investigational ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) therapeutics, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) acceptance of the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application filed by Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”) for LY3819469, the second clinical-stage candidate to emerge from Dicerna’s collaboration with Lilly. The IND milestone triggers a $10 million payment to Dicerna and enables Lilly to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of LY3819469, an investigational GalXC™ RNAi candidate targeting the <i>LPA </i>gene as a potential treatment of cardiometabolic diseases.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“This milestone marks the second IND generated through our productive collaboration with Lilly,” said Bob D. Brown, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Vice President of R&amp;D at Dicerna. “In addition to the two candidates now at clinical stage, there are so far, nine discovery research programs connected to this alliance, emphasizing Dicerna’s and Lilly’s shared commitment to bringing forward new RNAi-based therapies to treat a broad range of diseases.”

The IND filing for LY3819469 is the second development milestone achieved under a 2018 global licensing and research collaboration between Dicerna and Lilly focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of potential new therapies for cardiometabolic and neurodegenerative diseases and pain. This investigational cardiometabolic therapy and future therapies to emerge from the two companies’ collaboration leverage Dicerna's proprietary GalXC RNAi technology platform.

Under the agreement, Dicerna is eligible to receive up to $350 million in development and commercialization milestones for each GalXC hepatocyte target and $355 million for each non-hepatocyte target, as well as tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single-digits to low double-digits on potential product sales.

<b>About RNAi and Dicerna’s GalXC™ RNAi Platform Technologies</b>

Ribonucleic acid interference, or RNAi, provides a unique advantage to other disease inhibitor technologies, like small-molecule pharmaceuticals or monoclonal antibodies. Instead of targeting proteins after they have been produced and released, RNAi silences the genes themselves via the specific destruction of the messenger RNA (mRNA) made from the gene. Rather than seeking to inhibit a protein, the RNAi approach can prevent a disease-causing protein’s creation, directly impacting disease manifestation.

Dicerna’s proprietary GalXC™ RNAi platform aims to advance the development of next-generation RNAi-based therapies. Investigational therapeutics developed using our flagship GalXC technology utilize a proprietary <i>N</i>-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc)-mediated structure of double-stranded RNA molecules that are designed to bind specifically to receptors on liver cells, leading to selective hepatocyte internalization and access to the RNAi machinery within the cells. Dicerna is continuously innovating and exploring new applications of RNAi technology beyond GalNAc-mediated delivery to the liver, including alternative RNA structures and fully synthetic ligands that target other tissues and enable new therapeutic applications, referred to as GalXC-Plus™.

<b>About Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</b>

Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan; President, Representative Director, Gyo Sagara; “ONO”) and Bristol-Myers Squibb K.K. (Shinjuku, Tokyo; President, Jean-Christophe Barland; “BMSKK”) today announced that the companies have received approvals in Japan for Opdivo® (generic name: nivolumab) Intravenous Infusion (“Opdivo”), a human PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and Yervoy® (generic name: ipilimumab) Injection (“Yervoy”), a human monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, in combination therapy for the first-line treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma, for a partial change in approved items of the manufacturing and marketing approval. This approval is based on the results of the preplanned interim analysis from a global multi-center, randomized, open-label Phase III clinical study (CheckMate -743 study), evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy combination treatment, compared to standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy (combination therapy with pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin) in patients with previously untreated unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. In this analysis, Opdivo plus Yervoy combination treatment demonstrated a significant extension of overall survival (OS), the primary endpoint, versus chemotherapy. The safety profile of Opdivo plus Yervoy combination treatment observed in this study was consistent with those previously reported in the studies for the combination treatment. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a malignant tumor derived from undifferentiated mesenchymal cells of the mesothelium covering the thoracic surface and its underlying connective tissue. It is estimated that there are about 2,000 affected patients* with MPM in Japan. It is known that the cause of its occurrence is highly related to asbestos inhaled into the body in occupational or living environment and that MPM develops after a period of about 30 to 50 years following asbestos exposure. The standard of care treatment for MPM is combination therapy of pemetrexed and cisplatin. This approval is expected to allow Opdivo plus Yervoy combination treatment to become a new treatment option for this patient population. *: Patient Survey 2017, Statistics and Information Department of the Minister's Secretariat at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) About CheckMate -743 CheckMate -743 is a global multi-center, randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy combination treatment compared to chemotherapy (combination treatment of pemetrexed and either of cisplatin or carboplatin) in patients with previously untreated malignant pleural mesothelioma. In the trial, patients were randomized to receive either Opdivo at 3 mg/kg every two weeks and Yervoy at 1 mg/kg every six weeks for up to 24 months, or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5 plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 in 21-day cycles for six cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the trial was OS in all randomized patients. Key secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS).

About Opdivo Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers since the approval for the treatment of melanoma in Japan in July 2014. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, the US and European Union. In Japan, ONO launched Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable melanoma in September 2014. Thereafter, Opdivo received an approval for additional indications of unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer in December 2015, unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma in August 2016, relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma in December 2016, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer in March 2017, unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer which has progressed after chemotherapy in September 2017, unresectable advanced or recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma which has progressed after chemotherapy in August 2018, and microsatellite instability high (MSI-High) unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer that has progressed following chemotherapy and unresectable advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer that has progressed following chemotherapy in February 2020. In addition, ONO is conducting clinical development program including hepatocellular carcinoma, urothelial cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer, etc. About Yervoy Yervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody, and binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyteassociated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4, and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Yervoy 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Yervoy is now approved in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for Yervoy spanning multiple tumor types. In Japan, BMSKK received an approval of Yervoy for the treatment of unresectable melanoma in July 2015. About the ONO and Bristol-Myers Squibb Collaboration In 2011, through a collaboration agreement made between ONO and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), ONO granted BMS its territorial rights to develop and commercialize Opdivo globally except in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where ONO had retained all rights to Opdivo except the US at the time. In July 2014, ONO and BMS further expanded the companies’ strategic collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize multiple immunotherapies – as single agent and combination regimens – for patients with cancer in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

<span class=""bw-dateline-wrapper"">PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span>Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zeposia<sup>®</sup> (ozanimod) 0.92 mg for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<sup>1 </sup><i>Zeposia</i>, an oral medication taken once daily, is the first and only sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator approved for patients with moderately to severely active UC. The mechanism by which <i>Zeposia</i> exerts therapeutic effects in UC is unknown but may involve the reduction of lymphocyte migration into the intestines. It is thought that by targeting S1P receptors on lymphocytes, a type of immune system cell, <i>Zeposia</i> reduces the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood.<sup>1,3,4</sup>

“Despite the availability of approved therapies, there is still unmet need and an opportunity to deliver additional treatment options to help patients better manage their disease,” said Adam Lenkowsky, general manager and head, U.S., Cardiovascular, Immunology and Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb.<sup>5</sup> “We’re thrilled that our pursuit of transformative science in immunology may benefit patients in their ulcerative colitis treatment by introducing a new option that has a different mechanism of action than available therapies. <i>Zeposia </i>combines disease control through lasting remission and demonstrated safety in a once-daily pill.”<sup>1</sup>

The approval is based on data from True North, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating <i>Zeposia</i> as an induction and maintenance therapy versus placebo in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. During induction at Week 10 (<i>Zeposia</i> N=429 versus placebo N=216) the trial met its primary endpoint of clinical remission<sup>a</sup> (18% versus 6%, p&lt;0.0001) as well as key secondary endpoints, including clinical response<sup>b</sup> (48% versus 26%, p&lt;0.0001), endoscopic improvement<sup>c</sup> (27% versus 12%, p&lt;0.0001) and endoscopic-histologic mucosal improvement<sup>d</sup> (13% versus 4%, p&lt;0.001) for <i>Zeposia</i> versus placebo, respectively. During maintenance at Week 52 (<i>Zeposia</i> N=230 versus placebo N=227) the trial met its primary endpoint of clinical remission<sup>a</sup> (37% versus 19%, p&lt;0.0001) as well as key secondary endpoints, including clinical response (60% versus 41%, p&lt;0.0001), endoscopic improvement (46% versus 26%, p&lt;0.001), corticosteroid-free clinical remission<sup>e</sup> (32% versus 17%, p&lt;0.001) and endoscopic-histologic mucosal improvement (30% versus 14%, p&lt;0.001) for <i>Zeposia</i> versus placebo, respectively. Decreases in rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores were observed as early as Week 2 (i.e.,1 week after completing the required 7-day dosage titration) in patients treated with <i>Zeposia</i>.

<i>Zeposia</i> is contraindicated in patients who in the last six months experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III/IV heart failure or have the presence of Mobitz type II second-degree or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial block, unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker; patients with severe untreated sleep apnea; and patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor. <i>Zeposia</i> is associated with the following Warnings and Precautions: increased risk of infections, bradyarrhythmia and atrioventricular conduction delays, liver injury, fetal risk, increased blood pressure, respiratory effects, macular edema, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), unintended additive immunosuppressive effects from prior immunosuppressive or immune-modulating drugs, and severe increase in disability and immune system effects after stopping <i>Zeposia</i>. Please see Important Safety Information for additional details. The most common adverse reactions (incidence = 4%) were liver test increased, upper respiratory infection, and headache.<sup>1</sup>

“In True North,<i> Zeposia</i> demonstrated efficacy for endpoints such as clinical remission, endoscopic and histological mucosal improvement and safety. All are very relevant considerations for patients with ulcerative colitis,” said Michael Chiorean, M.D., AGAF, FASGE, co-director of IBD Center, Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, Washington.<sup>6 </sup>“<i>Zeposia</i> has the potential to be an important new treatment option for adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.”<sup>1</sup>

“Ulcerative colitis can be debilitating and unpredictable for the people living with this chronic inflammatory bowel disease,” said Michael Osso, President &amp; CEO of the Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Foundation.<sup>2,7,8</sup> “The approval of this new oral treatment is welcome news for our community and provides hope to many patients who are looking for new options to achieve symptom relief and remission.”<sup>1</sup>

Bristol Myers Squibb is committed to making <i>Zeposia</i> accessible to the patients who need it. The <i>Zeposia</i> 360 Support™ program will facilitate access to <i>Zeposia</i> for appropriate patients with UC. This includes a co-pay program for eligible appropriate patients to pay as little as $0 for their <i>Zeposia</i> prescription, assistance with financial support and a program that may help eligible patients with commercial insurance to receive free medication while they are experiencing delays or issues with insurance coverage. Support for eligible patients is also available for the routine initiation assessments, such as lab work. Through the program, health care professionals can opt to have eligible patients receive these tests in their own homes. These costs, whether incurred at home or in office, may be reimbursed. Terms, conditions, and eligibility criteria apply.

A Marketing Authorization Application for <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC in the European Union is currently under review with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A regulatory decision from the EMA is expected the second half of 2021.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About True North
</span></b>True North is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of Zeposia<sup>® </sup>(ozanimod) 0.92 mg in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to any of the following: oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators or a biologic. Patients were to be receiving treatment with oral aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids prior to and during the induction period.<sup>1</sup> A total of 30% of patients had previously failed or were intolerant to TNF blockers. Of these patients, 63% received at least two biologics including TNF blockers. At study entry, mean age was 42 years, 60% were male and mean disease duration was 7 years; patient characteristics were well-balanced across treatment groups.<sup>9</sup> In the 10 week induction study (UC Study 1), a total of 645 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive <i>Zeposia</i> (N=429) or placebo (N=216), of whom 94% and 89%, respectively, completed the induction study.<sup>9</sup>

In maintenance (UC Study 2), a total of 457 patients who received <i>Zeposia</i> in either UC Study 1 or in an open-label arm and achieved clinical response at Week 10 were re-randomized 1:1 and were treated with either <i>Zeposia</i> 0.92 mg (N=230) or placebo (N=227) for 42 weeks, for a total of 52 weeks of treatment.<sup>1</sup> Concomitant aminosalicylates were required to remain stable through Week 52. Patients on concomitant corticosteroids were to taper their dose upon entering the maintenance study.<sup>1</sup> Of these, 80% and 54.6% of patients who received <i>Zeposia</i> and placebo, respectively, completed the study.<sup>10</sup>

All eligible patients were rolled into an open-label extension trial, which is ongoing and designed to assess the longer-term profile of <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.<sup>10</sup> More information can be found on <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov&amp;esheet=52436986&amp;newsitemid=20210527005878&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.clinicaltrials.gov&amp;index=4&amp;md5=114adf4b73b9d5de65970a94cabf3c32"" rel=""nofollow"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>, NCT02435992.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Ulcerative Colitis
</span></b>Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is characterized by an irregular, chronic immune response that creates inflammation and ulcers (sores) in the mucosa (lining) of the large intestine (colon) or rectum.<sup>6</sup> Symptoms include bloody stools, severe diarrhea and frequent abdominal pain.<sup>11</sup> Ulcerative colitis has a major impact on patients' health-related quality of life, including physical functioning, social and emotional well-being and ability to go to work/school.<sup>6</sup> Many patients have an inadequate response or do not respond at all to currently available therapies.<sup>5</sup> As of 2015, it was estimated that approximately 3 million adults in the United States have IBD, which includes UC and Crohn's disease.<sup>12</sup>

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Zeposia<sup>®</sup> (ozanimod)
</span></b>Zeposia<sup>® </sup>(ozanimod) is an oral, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5.<sup>1,4</sup><i>Zeposia</i> reduces the capacity of lymphocytes to migrate from lymphoid tissue, reducing the number of circulating lymphocytes in peripheral blood.<sup>4</sup> The mechanism by which <i>Zeposia</i> exerts therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis is unknown but may involve the reduction of lymphocyte migration into the intestines.

Bristol Myers Squibb is continuing to evaluate <i>Zeposia</i> in an open-label extension trial, which is ongoing and designed to assess the longer-term profile of <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The company is also investigating <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in the ongoing Phase 3 YELLOWSTONE clinical trial program.

<i>Zeposia</i> was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in March 2020. The European Commission approved <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with active disease as defined by clinical or imaging features in May 2020. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated Bristol Myers Squibb’s Marketing Authorization Application for <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in December 2020. A regulatory decision from the EMA is expected in the second half of 2021.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">INDICATIONS</span></b><span class=""bwuline"">
</span>ZEPOSIA<sup>® </sup>(ozanimod) is indicated for the treatment of:

1. Relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.
2. Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
</span></b><b>Contraindications:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Patients who in the last 6 months, experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III/IV heart failure or have the presence of Mobitz type II second-degree or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial block, unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker</li>
 	<li>Patients with severe untreated sleep apnea</li>
 	<li>Patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor</li>
</ul>
<b>Infections:</b> ZEPOSIA may increase the susceptibility to infections. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain a recent (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS or UC therapy) complete blood count (CBC) including lymphocyte count before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Delay initiation of ZEPOSIA in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. Consider interruption of treatment with ZEPOSIA if a patient develops a serious infection. Continue monitoring for infections up to 3 months after discontinuing ZEPOSIA
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Herpes zoster was reported as an adverse reaction in ZEPOSIA-treated patients. Herpes simplex encephalitis and varicella zoster meningitis have been reported with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. Patients without a healthcare professional-confirmed history of varicella (chickenpox), or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV), should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating ZEPOSIA. A full course of vaccination for antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with ZEPOSIA</li>
 	<li>Cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis (CM) were reported in patients treated with another S1P receptor modulator. If CM is suspected, ZEPOSIA should be suspended until cryptococcal infection has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be initiated</li>
 	<li>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that typically occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. No cases of PML were identified in active-controlled MS clinical trials with ZEPOSIA. PML has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators and other MS and UC therapies and has been associated with some risk factors. If PML is suspected, withhold ZEPOSIA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. If confirmed, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued</li>
 	<li>In the MS and UC clinical studies, patients who received ZEPOSIA were not to receive concomitant treatment with antineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies used for treatment of MS and UC. Concomitant use of ZEPOSIA with any of these therapies would be expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression. When switching to ZEPOSIA from immunosuppressive medications, consider the duration of their effects and their mode of action to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects</li>
 	<li>Use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and for 3 months after treatment with ZEPOSIA. If live attenuated vaccine immunizations are required, administer at least 1 month prior to initiation of ZEPOSIA</li>
</ul>
<b>Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Conduction Delays:</b> Since initiation of ZEPOSIA may result in a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays, dose titration is recommended to help reduce cardiac effects. Initiation of ZEPOSIA without dose escalation may result in greater decreases in heart rate. If treatment with ZEPOSIA is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought for those individuals:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>with significant QT prolongation</li>
 	<li>with arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class 1a or III anti-arrhythmic drugs</li>
 	<li>with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension</li>
 	<li>with a history of Mobitz type II second-degree or higher AV block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block</li>
</ul>
<b>Liver Injury:</b> Elevations of aminotransferases may occur in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain liver function tests, if not recently available (i.e., within 6 months), before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction should have hepatic enzymes checked and ZEPOSIA should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Caution should be exercised when using ZEPOSIA in patients with history of significant liver disease

<b>Fetal Risk:</b> There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal studies, ZEPOSIA may cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 3 months after stopping ZEPOSIA

<b>Increased Blood Pressure:</b> Increase in systolic pressure was observed after about 3 months of treatment and persisted throughout treatment. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment and managed appropriately. Certain foods that may contain very high amounts of tyramine could cause severe hypertension in patients taking ZEPOSIA. Patients should be advised to avoid foods containing a very large amount of tyramine while taking ZEPOSIA

<b>Respiratory Effects:</b> ZEPOSIA may cause a decline in pulmonary function. Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function should be performed during therapy, if clinically indicated

<b>Macular edema:</b> S1P modulators have been associated with an increased risk of macular edema. Patients with a history of uveitis or diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Patients with a history of these conditions should have an ophthalmic evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, prior to treatment initiation and regular follow-up examinations. An ophthalmic evaluation is recommended in all patients at any time if there is a change in vision. Continued use of ZEPOSIA in patients with macular edema has not been evaluated; potential benefits and risks for the individual patient should be considered if deciding whether ZEPOSIA should be discontinued

<b>Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES):</b> Rare cases of PRES have been reported in patients receiving a S1P receptor modulator. If a ZEPOSIA-treated patient develops unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms or any symptom/sign suggestive of an increase in intracranial pressure, a complete physical and neurological examination should be conducted. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued

<b>Unintended Additive Immunosuppressive Effects From Prior Immunosuppressive or Immune-Modulating Drugs:</b> When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects while at the same time minimizing risk of disease reactivation. Initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA after treatment with alemtuzumab is not recommended

<b>Severe Increase in Disability After Stopping ZEPOSIA:</b> Severe exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after discontinuation of a S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease should be considered after stopping ZEPOSIA treatment so patients should be monitored upon discontinuation

<b>Immune System Effects After Stopping ZEPOSIA:</b> After discontinuing ZEPOSIA, the median time for lymphocyte counts to return to the normal range was 30 days with approximately 90% of patients in the normal range within 3 months. Use of immunosuppressants within this period may lead to an additive effect on the immune system, therefore caution should be applied when initiating other drugs 4 weeks after the last dose of ZEPOSIA

<b>Most Common Adverse Reactions </b>that occurred in the MS clinical trials of ZEPOSIA-treated patients<b></b>(= 4%):<b></b>upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infection, back pain, and hypertension

In the UC clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions that occurred in =4% of ZEPOSIA-treated patients and greater than in patients who received placebo were upper respiratory infection, liver test increased, and headache

<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca’s<i> Tagrisso</i> (osimertinib) has been approved in the European Union (EU) for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early-stage (IB, II and IIIA) epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete tumour resection with curative intent. <i>Tagrisso</i> is indicated for EGFRm patients whose tumours have exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) mutations.

The approval by the European Commission was based on positive results from the ADAURA Phase III trial in which <i>Tagrisso</i> demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in the primary analysis population of patients with Stage II and IIIA EGFRm NSCLC. The trial also showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in DFS for <i>Tagrisso</i> in the overall trial population, a key secondary endpoint.

While up to 30% of all patients with NSCLC may be diagnosed early enough to have surgery with curative intent, recurrence is still common in early-stage disease. Historically, nearly half of patients diagnosed in Stage IB, and over three quarters of patients diagnosed in Stage IIIA, have experienced disease recurrence within five years.<sup>1-3</sup> About a fifth of the world’s lung cancer patients are in the EU and among those with NSCLC, approximately 15% have tumours with an EGFR mutation.<sup>4-6</sup>

Margarita Majem, MD, PhD, Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Spain, said: “In the early stages of lung cancer, where tumour resection is possible but recurrence is far too common, adjuvant <i>Tagrisso</i> has shown an unprecedented disease-free survival benefit for patients with EGFR mutations. I expect this approval will change clinical practice in the EU, as it heightens the critical importance of EGFR mutation testing across all stages of lung cancer to ensure as many patients as possible can benefit from targeted medicines like <i>Tagrisso.</i>”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “We know the earlier a patient’s cancer is detected and treated, the greater chance they may have of being cured, which is why this approval is significant. For the first time, patients in the EU with EGFR-mutated lung cancer have a targeted, biomarker-driven treatment option available in the early stages of their disease that can help them live cancer-free longer.”

In the ADAURA trial, adjuvant treatment with <i>Tagrisso</i> reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 83% in patients with Stage II and IIIA disease (hazard ratio [HR] 0.17; 99.06% confidence interval [CI] 0.11-0.26; p&lt;0.001) and by 80% in the overall trial population of patients with Stage IB-IIIA disease (HR 0.20; 99.12% CI 0.14-0.30; p&lt;0.001).

Consistent DFS results were seen regardless of prior adjuvant chemotherapy use and across all prespecified subgroups. The safety and tolerability of <i>Tagrisso</i> in this trial was consistent with previous trials in the metastatic setting. The ADAURA results were published in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2027071"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>.

<i>Tagrisso </i>is now approved to treat early-stage lung cancer in more than fifty countries, including in <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/tagrisso-approved-in-the-us-for-early-lung-cancer.html"">the US</a> and <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/tagrisso-approved-in-china-in-early-lung-cancer.html"">China</a>, and additional global regulatory reviews are ongoing. <i>Tagrisso</i> is also approved for the 1st-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC and for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC in the EU, the US, Japan, China and many other countries.

<b>Lung cancer
</b>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.<sup>4</sup> Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.<sup>7 </sup>The majority of NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease while approximately 25-30% present with resectable disease at diagnosis.<sup>1-2</sup> Early-stage lung cancer diagnoses are often only made when the cancer is found on imaging for an unrelated condition.<sup>8-9</sup>

For patients with resectable tumours, the majority of patients eventually develop recurrence despite complete tumour resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.<sup>3</sup>

Approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and Europe, and 30-40% of patients in Asia have EGFRm NSCLC.<sup>10-12</sup> These patients are particularly sensitive to treatment with an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which blocks the cell-signalling pathways that drive the growth of tumour cells.<sup>13</sup>

<b>ADAURA</b>
ADAURA is a randomised, double-blind, global, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with Stage IB, II and IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumour resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated. Patients were treated with <i>Tagrisso</i> 80mg once-daily oral tablets or placebo for three years or until disease recurrence.

The trial enrolled patients in more than 200 centres across more than 20 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint was DFS in Stage II and IIIA patients and a key secondary endpoint was DFS in Stage IB, II and IIIA patients.

The data readout was originally anticipated in 2022. In April 2020, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended for the trial to be unblinded two years early based on a determination of overwhelming efficacy. Treating physicians and patients continue to participate and remain blinded to treatment. The trial will continue to assess overall survival.

<b><i>Tagrisso</i></b>
<i>Tagrisso</i> (osimertinib) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR TKI with clinical activity against central nervous system metastases.<i> Tagrisso</i> (40mg and 80mg once-daily oral tablets) has been used to treat more than 250,000 patients across indications worldwide and AstraZeneca continues to explore <i>Tagrisso</i> as a treatment for patients across multiple stages of EGFRm NSCLC.

In Phase III trials, <i>Tagrisso </i>is being tested in the neoadjuvant resectable setting (NeoADAURA), in the Stage III locally advanced unresectable setting (LAURA) and, in combination with chemotherapy, in the Stage III locally advanced or Stage IV metastatic settings (FLAURA2). AstraZeneca is also researching ways to address tumour mechanisms of resistance through the SAVANNAH and ORCHARD Phase II trials, which test <i>Tagrisso </i>given concomitantly with savolitinib, an oral, potent and highly selective MET TKI, as well as other potential new medicines.

<p align=""justify"">LEXINGTON, Mass. and AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands, May 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- uniQure N.V. (NASDAQ: QURE), a leading gene therapy company advancing transformative therapies for patients with severe medical needs, today announced that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) overseeing the Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT-130 for the treatment of Huntington’s disease has met and reviewed safety data for the fully enrolled first cohort of ten patients. This data set included nine-month safety data from the first two enrolled patients, six-month safety data from the next two enrolled patients, and 30-day safety data on remaining six patients in the trial. The DSMB recommended continued dosing in the study, and uniQure will now begin to enroll patients in the higher-dose cohort of the trial. The Phase I/II study is a double-blind, randomized clinical trial being conducted in the United States. To date, six patients have been treated with AMT-130, and four patients received the imitation surgery.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are very pleased with the progress of the study and with the recommendations of the DSMB. We look forward to proceeding with dose-escalation in the second cohort of patients,” said Ricardo Dolmetsch, Ph.D., president of research and development at uniQure. “We remain highly focused on progressing this therapy given the significant unmet need in the Huntington’s disease community and are committed to initiating clinical development of AMT-130 in Europe in the second half of this year and to sharing initial imaging and biomarker data from the U.S. clinical trial before the end of the year.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Phase I/II Clinical Program of AMT-130</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The U.S. Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT-130 for the treatment of Huntington’s disease will explore the safety, tolerability, and efficacy signals in 26 total patients with early manifest Huntington’s disease split into a 10 patient, low-dose cohort followed by a 16 patient, higher-dose cohort randomized to treatment with AMT-130 or an imitation (sham) surgery. The multi-center trial consists of a blinded 12-month core study period followed by unblinded long-term follow-up for five years. Patients will receive a single administration of AMT-130 through MRI-guided, convection-enhanced stereotactic neurosurgical delivery directly into the striatum (caudate and putamen). Additional details are available on <a title=""www.clinicaltrials.gov"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9WbQGvITolr2IXHbV3-sLD0B4Gk1n5aavTE27FV19e7emRvHY2GYSGaegDpuXLzXoJOjQNA1HfcgdDTpDmTFQlMJY0jwSJzjh1GnmP-WRcg="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a> (NCT04120493).</p>
<p align=""justify"">The European, open-label Phase Ib/II study of AMT-130 will enroll 15 patients with early manifest Huntington’s disease across two dose cohorts. Together with the U.S. study, the European study is intended to establish safety, proof of concept, and the optimal dose of AMT-130 to take forward into Phase III development or into a confirmatory study should an accelerated registration pathway be feasible.</p>
<p align=""justify"">AMT-130 is uniQure’s first clinical program focusing on the central nervous system (CNS) incorporating its proprietary miQURE™ platform.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Huntington’s Disease</strong>
Huntington’s disease is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder that leads to motor symptoms including chorea, and behavioral abnormalities and cognitive decline resulting in progressive physical and mental deterioration. The disease is an autosomal dominant condition with a disease-causing CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the huntingtin gene that leads to the production and aggregation of abnormal protein in the brain. Despite the clear etiology of Huntington’s disease, there are no currently approved therapies to delay the onset or to slow the disease’s progression.</p>

(Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-advisory-committee-votes-in-favor-of-the-benefits-of-teplizumab-outweighing-the-risks-in-support-of-approval-to-delay-clinical-type-1-diabetes-t1d-301301444.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">PRVB</a>), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to intercepting and preventing immune-mediated disease, today announced that the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted 10 yes and 7 no on the question, ""Does the information provided in the background documents and presentations by the Applicant and FDA show that the benefits of teplizumab outweigh the risks in support of approval to delay clinical type 1 diabetes mellitus?"".</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The EMDAC based its recommendation on safety and efficacy data from the pivotal TN-10 Study in which a single 14-day course of teplizumab delayed insulin-dependent, clinical-stage disease by a median of at least two years in presymptomatic patients with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes (T1D) compared to placebo. Acknowledging the significant unmet medical need facing early-stage T1D patients, the Committee Members discussed the strengths and limitations of the clinical data and provided opinions on the proposed indication statement and potential post-marketing studies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""We want to first and foremost thank everyone throughout the T1D community, the patients, the caregivers and the clinicians for their support today,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Ashleigh Palmer</span>, co-founder and CEO, Provention Bio. ""We especially want to thank T1D clinicians, patients and families for having the courage and conviction to so articulately describe during today's open public hearing, as well as in the over 180 letters submitted to the EMDAC docket, what it means to live with T1D and how meaningful a delay in onset of two or more years would be. We also want to thank TrialNet, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the investigators and clinical teams, and all the patients and their families who participated in the TN-10 study and contributed to teplizumab-related foundational scientific and clinical research over the past two decades. Finally we would like to thank the EMDAC for their thorough discussion and deliberations resulting in today's favorable vote. We know the T1D community and at-risk patients and their families in particular are waiting urgently for access to clinical advancements to address their significant medical needs. We remain committed to working closely with the FDA to hopefully secure approval of teplizumab and potentially bring the first disease-modifying therapy in T1D to at-risk patients as soon as possible.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to teplizumab and priority review designation for the Biologics License Application (BLA). The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date is <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2, 2021</span>. The FDA will consider today's vote as it reviews the BLA, although it is not obligated to follow the Committee's recommendation. The previously disclosed matter surrounding Pharmacokinetic (PK) comparability was not a topic for discussion during the Advisory Committee meeting. The Company reiterates previous guidance that the FDA's PK comparability considerations are likely to result in a delay in potential BLA approval timelines.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The Unmet Need in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D):</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Over 1.6 million Americans have T1D, an autoimmune disease caused by the destruction of beta cells. Diagnosis of T1D usually occurs in children and young adults, but it can happen at any age after symptoms appear when a person cannot make enough insulin. However, T1D starts in the body long before any symptoms and can be detected through a blood test. The psychological impact of T1D is hard to quantify, but a diagnosis is life-altering, and regular monitoring and maintenance can be extremely stressful. T1D typically takes more than a decade off a person's life, and life expectancy is reduced by 16 years on average for people diagnosed before the age of 10. Insulin is the current T1D treatment. It is necessary to keep patients alive, but it is a constant effort for patients. No disease-modifying treatments for T1D are currently available.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Teplizumab (PRV-031):<br class=""dnr"" /><br class=""dnr"" /></b>Teplizumab is an investigational anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with a filed BLA under Priority Review by the FDA for the delay of clinical T1D in at-risk individuals. In the pivotal TN-10 Study, a single 14-day course of teplizumab delayed insulin-dependent, clinical-stage disease by a median of at least two years in presymptomatic patients with Stage 2 T1D compared to placebo. The observed adverse events are mechanism-based, transient, and predictable, including lymphopenia, transaminase elevations, rash, and cytokine release events.  These results were published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> and simultaneously presented at the American Diabetes Association meeting in 2019.   More than 800 patients have received teplizumab in multiple clinical studies involving more than 1,000 subjects. In previous studies of newly diagnosed patients, teplizumab consistently demonstrated the ability to preserve beta-cell function as shown by C-peptide, a measure of endogenous insulin production. It correspondingly reduced the need for exogenous insulin use. Teplizumab has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and PRIME designation by the European Medicines Administration. Provention is currently also evaluating teplizumab in patients with newly diagnosed insulin-dependent T1D (the Phase 3 PROTECT study).</p>

(Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seelos-therapeutics-receives-european-orphan-drug-designation-for-sls-005-trehalose-in-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-301300414.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">SEEL</a>), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapies for central nervous system disorders and rare diseases, today announced it has received European Orphan Drug Designation for SLS-005 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under orphan designation in the European Union (EU), Seelos stands to benefit from several incentives such as protocol assistance, reduced regulatory fees and market exclusivity. European guidelines for Orphan Drug Designation are for diseases affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In November, SLS-005 was granted Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ALS. SLS-005 was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and EMA for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), Sanfilippo syndrome and Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD). SLS-005 has also been granted Fast Track designation from the FDA for OPMD.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a group of rare neurological diseases that mainly involve the nerve cells (neurons) responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. In ALS, both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die and stop sending messages to the muscles. Unable to function, the muscles gradually weaken, start to twitch (called fasciculations), and waste away (atrophy). Eventually, the brain loses its ability to initiate and control voluntary movements. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time. The majority of ALS cases (90 percent or more) are considered sporadic. This means the disease seems to occur at random with no clearly associated risk factors and no family history of the disease. Although family members of people with sporadic ALS are at an increased risk for the disease, the overall risk is very low, and most will not develop ALS.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from when the symptoms first appear. However, about 10 percent of people with ALS survive for 10 or more years. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and no effective treatment to halt or reverse the progression of the disease.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Trehalose</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Trehalose is a low molecular weight disaccharide (0.342 kDa) that crosses the blood brain barrier, stabilizes proteins and, importantly, activates autophagy, which is the process that clears material from cells. In animal models of several diseases associated with abnormal cellular protein aggregation or storage of pathologic material, it has been shown to reduce aggregation of misfolded proteins and reduce accumulation of pathologic material. Trehalose activates autophagy through the activation of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a key factor in lysosomal and autophagy gene expression. Activation of TFEB is an emerging therapeutic target for a number of diseases with pathologic accumulation of storage material.</p>

""The FDA approval of LUMAKRAS is a breakthrough moment for patients with <i>KRAS</i> G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer because there is now a targeted therapy for this common, but previously elusive, mutation,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">David M. Reese</span>, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""<i>KRAS</i> has challenged cancer researchers for more than 40 years with many deeming it as 'undruggable.' The LUMAKRAS development program was a race against cancer for Amgen's scientists and clinical trial investigators who together have now successfully delivered this new medicine to patients in less than three years—from first patient dosed to U.S. regulatory approval.""

The FDA approval of LUMAKRAS is based on results from a subset of patients in CodeBreaK 100, the largest clinical trial conducted to date exclusively for patients with the <i>KRAS</i> G12C mutation. The trial demonstrated favorable efficacy and tolerability in 124 patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation-positive NSCLC who had disease progression after receiving an immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy. In the trial, 960 mg of LUMAKRAS administered orally once-daily demonstrated an ORR (a proportion of patients with = 30% decrease in tumor) of 36% (95% CI: 28-45) with 81% (95% CI: 73-87) of patients achieving disease control (percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease for more than three months). The median DoR was 10 months. The most common adverse reactions (= 20%) were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity and cough. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of LUMAKRAS occurred in 9% of patients.

""Sotorasib represents a major advancement in oncology and changes the treatment paradigm for patients with <i>KRAS</i> G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer,"" said Bob T. Li, M.D., Ph.D., MPH, principal investigator at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ""Patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed beyond first-line treatment face a poor prognosis and have limited treatment options available to them. Sotorasib delivers a new option for these patients, and it is the first KRAS-targeted therapy to be approved after nearly four decades of research.""

NSCLC accounts for approximately 84% of the 2.2 million new lung cancer diagnoses each year worldwide, including approximately 236,000 new cases in the U.S.<sup>2,3</sup> <i>KRAS </i>G12C is one of the most prevalent driver mutations in NSCLC, with about 13% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC in the U.S. having the <i>KRAS</i> G12C mutation.<sup>1</sup>

<b>Amgen's Commitment to Comprehensive Biomarker Testing and Patient Support<br class=""dnr"" /></b>About half of all patients with NSCLC harbor a targetable driver mutation, yet despite the integral role that biomarkers play in identifying patients who may benefit from targeted therapies, many patients are not tested.<sup>4,5</sup>

Amgen has partnered with two companies—Guardant Health and QIAGEN—to develop blood- and tissue-based companion diagnostics (CDx), respectively, for LUMAKRAS. With the addition of these tests, patients and clinicians will have more options and flexibility for conducting <i>KRAS</i> G12C biomarker testing.

""Biomarker testing for patients with non-small cell lung cancer is critical because it informs a patient's treatment path with a personalized and tailored approach. The only way to identify the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation is to test for it, so I urge patients to ask their care teams about comprehensive biomarker testing. It is important that patients and their healthcare providers know that <i>KRAS</i> G12C is now an actionable mutation,"" said Andrea Ferris, president and CEO of LUNGevity. ""Today's FDA approval of a therapy targeted for <i>KRAS</i> G12C, one of the most prevalent biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer, brings hope to the many patients who carry this mutation and is a significant moment for the lung cancer community who need more innovative treatment options.""

Amgen is committed to supporting patients with NSCLC and to helping appropriate patients with affordable access to LUMAKRAS. Patients, caregivers and physicians who need support, tools or resources can contact Amgen Assist360™(1-888-4ASSIST). Amgen also provides patient assistance for its medicines marketed in the U.S. in a variety of ways, including free medicines through the Amgen Safety Net Foundation for qualifying individuals with no or limited drug coverage.

<b>About LUMAKRAS™ (sotorasib)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Amgen has taken on one of the toughest challenges of the last 40 years in cancer research by developing LUMAKRAS, a KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor.<sup>6</sup> LUMAKRAS was the first KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor to enter the clinic and is being studied in the largest clinical program exploring 11 combinations with global investigator sites spanning five continents.

LUMAKRAS has demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile with rapid, deep and durable anticancer activity in patients with locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation with a once daily oral formulation. As part of the evaluation for this accelerated approval, FDA is requiring a post-marketing trial to investigate whether a lower dose will have a similar clinical effect.

LUMAKRAS is also being studied in multiple other solid tumors.<sup>6</sup>

In the U.S., LUMAKRAS was reviewed by the FDA under its Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR), a pilot program that aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible. Amgen submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the EU in <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2020</span> and New Drug Applications in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> (J-NDA) and <span class=""xn-location"">Switzerland</span> in <span class=""xn-chron"">April 2021</span>. Additionally, Amgen submitted MAAs for sotorasib in <span class=""xn-location"">Australia</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Brazil</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> and the <span class=""xn-location"">United Kingdom</span> in <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2021</span> to participate in the FDA's Project Orbis initiative. Sotorasib was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. and <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.

<b>LUMAKRAS™ (sotorasib) U.S. Indication<br class=""dnr"" /></b>LUMAKRAS™ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

<b>About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and the <i>KRAS </i>G12C Mutation<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and it accounts for more deaths worldwide than colon cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.<sup>3</sup> Overall survival rates for NSCLC are improving, but remain poor for patients with advanced disease and 5-year survival is only 7% for those with metastatic disease.<sup>7</sup>

<i>KRAS </i>G12C is the most common <i>KRAS</i> mutation in NSCLC.<sup>8</sup> In the U.S., about 13% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC harbor the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation.<sup>1</sup> Unmet medical need remains high and treatment options are limited for NSCLC patients with the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation whose first-line treatment has failed to work or has stopped working. The outcomes with current therapies are suboptimal with a median progression-free survival of approximately 4 months following second-line treatment of <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutated NSCLC.<sup>9 </sup>

<b>About CodeBreaK<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen's drug sotorasib is designed to treat patients with an advanced solid tumor with the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers. As the most advanced <i>KRAS </i>G12C clinical development program, CodeBreaK has enrolled more than 800 patients across 13 tumor types since its inception.

CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutant solid tumors. Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The Phase 2 trial in NSCLC enrolled 126 patients, 124 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline. The Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer (CRC) is fully enrolled and topline results are expected later in 2021.

A global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutated NSCLC (CodeBreaK 200) has completed enrollment. Amgen also has several Phase <span class=""xn-money"">1b</span> studies investigating sotorasib monotherapy and sotorasib combination therapy across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment.

<b>Forward-Looking Statements<br class=""dnr"" /></b>This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the integration of Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) into our business (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), or the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in <span class=""xn-location"">Puerto Rico</span>, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

<strong>NEW YORK and MAINZ, GERMANY, May 28, 2021</strong> — Pfizer Inc.(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced that the Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) for COMIRNATY<sup>®</sup> in the European Union (EU) has been expanded to include individuals 12 to 15 years of age. This follows the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) positive opinion to authorize the vaccine in this age group. The extended indication for the CMA for COMIRNATY is valid in all 27 EU member states.

COMIRNATY was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive authorization in the EU and is the first to have its CMA extended to adolescents. Distribution and administration of COMIRNATY by the EU member states will continue to be determined according to the populations identified in the EU and per national guidance.

“Today’s extension of our COVID-19 vaccine authorization in the European Union is another critical milestone in our collective effort to broaden vaccination programs to as many people as possible,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “Making vaccines available  to adolescents will help re-open schools, and support the return to a normal day-to-day life.”

“This is a meaningful moment for adolescents, parents and entire families who are seeking protection from this virus and a return to normalcy,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “We appreciate the agency’s thorough and efficient review of the data from our clinical trial, and look forward to seeing more people across Europe immunized as a result of today’s decision.”

The EU decision is based on data from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, which enrolled 2,260 participants aged 12 to 15 years. Participants received two 30 µg doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Results from this trial, which were <a class=""ext"" href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107456"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-extlink="""">published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em></a> on May 27, 2021, showed a vaccine efficacy of 100% in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and robust antibody responses. In the trial, the vaccine was also generally well tolerated. Participants will continue to be monitored for long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose.

In addition, the pediatric study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine in children 6 months to 11 years of age is ongoing. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to have definitive readouts and, subject to the data generated, submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (e.g., in the U.S.) or a variation to Conditional Marketing Authorizations (e.g., in the EU) for two cohorts, including children 2-5 years of age and 5-11 years of age, in September. The readout and submission for the cohort of children 6 months to 2 years of age are expected in the fourth quarter.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which is based on BioNTech proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder in the European Union, and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer), United Kingdom, Canada and other countries in advance of a planned application for full marketing authorizations in these countries.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has not been approved or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for use in individuals 12 years of age and older. The emergency use of this product is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564 (b) (1) of the FD&amp;C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.

<strong>Basel, May 28, 2021</strong> — Today, Novartis reported the first interpretable year one results of the Phase III MERLIN study, a two-year study initiated in H2 2018, assessing the efficacy and safety of Beovu<sup>®</sup> (brolucizumab) 6 mg versus aflibercept 2 mg given every four weeks following the loading phase in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who have persistent retinal fluid despite anti-VEGF therapy.

Beovu met MERLIN’s primary endpoint of non-inferiority in change in best corrected visual acuity from baseline and superiority on select anatomical secondary endpoints at year one versus aflibercept when given every four weeks following the loading phase<sup>1</sup>. However, given every four weeks in MERLIN, IOI including RV, and RO were reported with a higher frequency in the Beovu 6 mg every four weeks arm when compared to aflibercept 2 mg every four weeks (IOI: 9.3% vs 4.5% of which RV: 0.8% vs 0.0%; RO: 2.0% vs 0.0%.)<sup>1</sup>. The overall rate of vision loss (15 letters or more) due to all causes was 4.8% in the Beovu arm and 1.7% in the aflibercept arm<sup>1</sup>.

“Although longer dosing intervals may benefit many people living with wet AMD and other retinal diseases, some are in need of monthly dosing to address persistent fluid. We initiated MERLIN and other clinical programs to explore Beovu for these patients,” said John Tsai, MD, Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “These data help inform our trials moving forward, so we can best determine how appropriate patients can benefit most from this important medicine.”

Novartis evaluated all ongoing brolucizumab clinical programs assessing studies with four week dosing intervals after the loading phase. In the interest of patient safety, Novartis has decided to terminate the MERLIN study and the RAPTOR and RAVEN studies, which were assessing the efficacy and safety of brolucizumab with six initial monthly injections in retinal vein occlusion. All other relevant ongoing trial protocols will be amended to discontinue four week dosing intervals after the loading phase. Clinical trial investigators have been informed and will appropriately follow up with their patients. Physicians should not treat patients with Beovu 6 mg at intervals less than two months beyond the first three doses.

Novartis has proactively communicated these data to health authorities and will pursue an update to the Beovu prescribing information globally.

When used on a two- to three-month interval following the loading phase, Beovu continues to be an important and effective treatment option for appropriate patients with wet AMD<sup>2,3</sup>. Novartis remains committed to supporting the retina community with information regarding Beovu. Beovu is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation or known hypersensitivity to brolucizumab<sup>4</sup>.

Further analysis of the clinical data from MERLIN is ongoing, and detailed data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. Novartis has a strong ongoing commitment to Ophthalmology and to bringing innovative treatments to patients with or at risk of developing eye conditions where there is a high unmet need.

<strong>About wet AMD</strong>
Wet AMD is the leading cause of severe vision loss and legal blindness in people over the age of 65 in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia, impacting an estimated 20 million people worldwide<sup>5-7</sup>. Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula, the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision<sup>8-10</sup>. These blood vessels are fragile and leak fluid, disrupting the normal retinal architecture and ultimately causing damage to the macula<sup>8-10</sup>.

Early symptoms of wet AMD include distorted vision (or metamorphopsia) and difficulties seeing objects clearly<sup>11</sup>. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are essential. As the disease progresses, cell damage increases, further reducing vision quality<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>. This progression can lead to a complete loss of central vision, leaving the patient unable to read, drive or recognize familiar faces and potentially depriving them of their independence<sup>12,13</sup>. Without treatment, vision can rapidly deteriorate<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>.

<strong>About Beovu (brolucizumab)</strong>
Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) is approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in more than 60 countries, including in the US, EU, UK, Japan, Canada and Australia<sup>4,15-18</sup>. Additional trials, which study the effects of brolucizumab in patients with wet AMD, diabetic macular edema (DME), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), are currently ongoing.

PALO ALTO, Calif. and LUGANO, Switzerland, May 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBIO), through its affiliate QED Therapeutics, Inc., and Helsinn Group today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TRUSELTIQ™ (infigratinib) under the accelerated approval program for the treatment of patients with previously-treated locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) harboring an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement. TRUSELTIQ is an orally administered, ATP-competitive, tyrosine kinase inhibitor of FGFR. In the pivotal trial of patients with advanced, unresectable CCA, an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis, TRUSELTIQ led to cases of tumor shrinkage. CCA is known to affect approximately 20,000 people in the United States and European Union each year and has a median five-year survival rate of only 9%.<sup>1</sup>

“This is an important milestone for patients diagnosed with FGFR2-fusion-driven cholangiocarcinoma who have recurred after first-line therapy and are in need of targeted options for further treatment,” said Susan Moran, M.D., M.S.C.E., Chief Medical Officer for QED. “Based on the efficacy seen to date, our team believes infigratinib possesses promise for a range of FGFR-driven conditions, including other cancers. We will continue to evaluate its safety and efficacy in these areas of unmet need.”

The approval of TRUSELTIQ is based on a Phase 2 clinical study in which 108 patients who had undergone at least one prior treatment for advanced CCA received 125 mg of TRUSELTIQ daily for 21 days of 28-day cycles. Of these patients, 107 (99%) had Stage IV CCA. All patients had received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy. The study’s primary endpoint demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 23% (95% CI 16-32%). The study also showed a median duration of response (DOR) of 5.0 months (95% CI 3.7–9.3 months). Common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities (of &gt;30%) were increased creatinine, increased phosphate, decreased phosphate, nail toxicity, stomatitis, increased alkaline phosphatase, decreased hemoglobin, increased alanine aminotransferase, dry eye, fatigue, increased lipase, decreased lymphocytes, increased calcium, decreased sodium, alopecia, increased triglycerides, increased aspartate aminotransferase, decreased platelets, increased urate, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, arthralgia, and dysgeusia. Please see below for additional important safety information for TRUSELTIQ.

The above data were presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium by the lead investigator, Milind Javle, M.D., Professor of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

“While targeted treatments have extended survival for many types of cancer, people diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma have previously been presented with extremely limited treatment options coupled with low statistical survival data,” said Dr. Javle. “In this study, TRUSELTIQ showed promise as a targeted treatment option for patients with FGFR2-fusion-driven cholangiocarcinoma with a well-tolerated safety profile in line with previous observations in this patient population.”

“The approval of TRUSELTIQ provides a new and exciting treatment option for patients with CCA harboring an FGFR2 fusion,” said Stacie Lindsey, Chief Executive Officer of the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation. “We appreciate the fact that there is a robust patient support program, ForgingBridges, to help patients access care and support them throughout their treatment journey.”

Additional marketing applications for infigratinib are currently under review in Australia and Canada under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence that allows for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among participating international regulatory agencies.

BridgeBio and Helsinn Group’s affiliate, Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc., will be jointly responsible for commercialization activities in the U.S. and will share U.S. profits and losses on an equal basis. Helsinn Group will have exclusive commercialization rights on infigratinib outside of the U.S., excluding China, Hong Kong and Macau. BridgeBio will be eligible for tiered royalties as a percentage of adjusted net sales, and payments totaling up to approximately $2.45 billion USD in the aggregate. Helsinn Group will fund the majority of ongoing and future research and development related to infigratinib in oncology. BridgeBio and Helsinn Group entered into a global collaboration and licensing agreement in March 2021. BridgeBio previously entered a strategic collaboration with LianBio for development and commercialization of infigratinib in oncology indications in China, Hong Kong and Macau.

Paul Rittman, Chief Executive Officer of Helsinn Therapeutics, said, “Today’s FDA approval of TRUSELTIQ for patients with previously-treated locally advanced or metastatic CCA harboring an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement provides a new therapy option for patients with a very low rate of survival. This new therapy has the potential to make a life changing impact on patients with few treatment options, and Helsinn Therapeutics looks forward to working with BridgeBio to make it widely accessible to health care providers and patients in the US.”

<strong>About </strong><strong>Cholangiocarcinoma</strong><strong> (CCA)</strong>
Cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the bile ducts of the liver, is a serious and often fatal disease which affects approximately 20,000 people in the United States and European Union each year. FGFR2 genetic aberrations are present in approximately 15% to 20% of people who have this disease. Currently, the five-year survival rate is only 9%.<sup>1</sup> Advanced, unresectable CCA is a rare, aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis.

<strong>Clinical Studies</strong><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>
The efficacy of TRUSELTIQ was based on a single-arm Phase 2 study which included 108 patients with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement. Ninety-nine percent of patients had metastatic (Stage IV) disease at the time of study entry.

These 108 adult patients with advanced/metastatic CCA received infigratinib 125 mg orally for 21 days of each 28-day cycle until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. All patients received prophylaxis with the oral phosphate binder sevelamer. TRUSELTIQ achieved a 23% objective response rate (ORR) and a median duration of response (DOR) of 5.0 months.

<strong>U.S. Indication for TRUSELTIQ</strong>
TRUSELTIQ is indicated for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test.

Accelerated approval was granted based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).

the safety profile of TRUSELTIQ for the treatment of patients with FGFR2 fusion driven CCA, including the most common adverse reactions and drug interactions; plans for the supply, manufacturing and distribution of TRUSELTIQ; the incidence and survival rate of CCA; the current FDA-approved TRUSELTIQ dosage and administration; the planned approval of TRUSELTIQ by foreign regulatory authorities and the necessary clinical trial results, and timing and completion of regulatory submissions related thereto; and the competitive environment and clinical and therapeutic potential of TRUSELTIQ; reflect our current views about our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to us and on assumptions we have made.  Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved.  Furthermore, actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and will be affected by a variety of risks and factors that are beyond our control including, without limitation: the safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of TRUSELTIQ observed to date may change adversely in ongoing analyses of trial data or subsequent to commercialization; despite having ongoing interactions with the FDA or other regulatory agencies, the FDA or such other regulatory agencies may not agree with QED’s regulatory approval strategies, components of QED’s filings, such as clinical trial designs, conduct and methodologies, or the sufficiency of data; the fact that accelerated approval of TRUSELTIQ was granted by the FDA based on overall response rate and duration of response, and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s); QED and/or Helsinn may encounter delays in meeting manufacturing or supply timelines or disruptions in their distribution plans for TRUSELTIQ; whether and when any regulatory submissions may be filed in various foreign jurisdictions and ultimately approved by foreign regulatory authorities;

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) today announced that its New Drug Application (NDA) for palovarotene, an oral, investigational, selective RAR? agonist for the prevention of heterotopic ossification (new bone formation) as a potential treatment option for people living with the progressive disabling and ultra-rare genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), has been accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The target regulatory action date assigned by the FDA under a Priority Review status is 30 November 2021.

FOP is an ultra-rare genetic disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1.36 per million individuals; however, the number of confirmed cases varies by country.<sup>1,2</sup> It is characterized by new bone formation outside of the normal skeletal system, like in soft connective tissues, a process known as heterotopic ossification (HO),<sup>3</sup> which can be preceded by painful soft-tissue swelling or “flare-ups”.<sup>2</sup> Flare-up episodes are common and are a substantial contributor to the formation of new HO, however HO can form in the absence of a flare-up. HO, once formed, is irreversible and leads to loss of mobility and shortened life expectancy.<sup>3</sup>

Dr. Howard Mayer, Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development, Ipsen, said “With no approved treatments for this progressive and debilitating disease, there remains a great unmet medical need for the FOP community. This year marks 15 years since the discovery of the mutation in the gene <i>ALK2/ACVR1</i> which causes FOP, and the palovarotene submission is the first worldwide for a potential treatment in this disease. Our teams at Ipsen are now focused on working closely with regulatory authorities to bring this potential treatment option to people living with FOP around the world. We want to thank all the people living with FOP, their families, caregivers and healthcare teams who have participated in the palovarotene clinical program.”

The NDA for palovarotene is primarily based on data from the ongoing MOVE trial, the first global multi-center Phase III trial in FOP. MOVE is an open-label, single-arm trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of a chronic/flare-up dosing regimen of palovarotene in decreasing new annualized HO volume in patients with FOP. Post hoc analyses* of the primary endpoint from the trial demonstrated a 62% reduction in mean annualized new HO volume in participants treated with palovarotene (8,821 mm<sup>3</sup>) (n=97) versus untreated participants from a natural-history study (23,318 mm<sup>3</sup>) (n=98) (nominal weighted linear mixed effects [wLME] model est. –11,611mm<sup>3</sup>, p-value = 0.0292). Overall, 29.3% of participants reported at least one serious adverse event (AE), including premature physeal closure (PPC) or epiphyseal disorder in 27.1% of the participants who were skeletally immature at baseline.<sup>4</sup> As of the data cut-off, the most common treatment related AEs included skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (97%), gastrointestinal disorders (77.8%), and infections and infestations (74.7%).<sup>4</sup>

“This FDA filing acceptance marks a significant milestone for Ipsen and those living with this relentless condition of FOP, which we hope will have a significant impact,” said Robert J. Pignolo, M.D., Ph.D., Chair, Geriatric Medicine &amp; Gerontology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine. “News of this potential new treatment will be welcomed by the FOP community, and we await further updates from the FDA. With ultra-rare conditions by their nature affecting very few people around the world it is so important we continue to make progress and advance the management of diseases like FOP.”

In addition to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Swissmedic MAA validations, Ipsen anticipates additional applications to other regulatory agencies in due course.

<b>About the palovarotene FOP clinical program</b>

The Phase III MOVE (NCT03312634) trial is an ongoing open-label, single-arm trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a chronic/flare-up dosing regimen of palovarotene, which comprises a 5mg daily dose that is increased at the start of a flare-up to 20mg for four weeks, followed by 10mg for eight weeks. At the end of the flare-up dosing period, the dose returns to the chronic 5mg daily dose. All dosing is weight-adjusted in skeletally immature participants (those under the age of 18 years with less than 90% skeletal maturity on hand/wrist x-rays performed at screening). The trial is being conducted in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<sup>5</sup> There are two ongoing Phase II (PVO-1A-202 [NCT02279095] and PVO-1A-204 [NCT02979769]) extension trials: 1) Study 202, an open-label extension of Study 201, the initial Phase II randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial; and 2) Study 204, an open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different palovarotene dosing regimens in patients with FOP in France.

In December 2019, a partial clinical hold was applied to participants under the age of 14 years participating in the Phase II (PVO-1A-202/204 and PVO-2A-201) and Phase III (PVO-1A-301) studies at all clinical sites globally. This was due to reports of premature physeal closure (PPC). A decision to pause dosing of palovarotene in all remaining participants in the global Phase III MOVE trial (PVO-1A-301), as well as the ongoing Phase II (PVO-1A-202/204) extension studies in FOP was made by Ipsen on January 24, 2020, based on results of a futility analysis as part of the pre-specified interim analysis (Bayesian compound Poisson analysis with square root transformation of the new HO volume data).

*Encouraging therapeutic activity was observed in post hoc analyses of interim data for the Phase III MOVE trial and shared with, and acknowledged by, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Post hoc analyses included Bayesian compound Poisson analysis without square-root transformation, and weighted linear mixed-effects models (with/without square-root transformation of the new HO volume data). As such, the Company amended the protocol for the Phase III MOVE trial to include updates to the statistical-analysis section, including additional analyses requested by the IDMC, to be performed in addition to the primary pre-specified analysis. The protocol amendments are based on the IDMC’s observation that the protocol pre-specified statistical model may have negatively affected the efficacy analysis and appears to have shifted the statistical conclusion from significant therapeutic benefit to showing futility of the treatment. Dosing for eligible study patients =14 years of age has resumed as of March 26, 2020 across the Phase II and Phase III programs for palovarotene in FOP.

<b>About palovarotene</b>

Palovarotene is an oral investigational, selective retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RAR?) agonist being developed as a potential treatment for people living with the debilitating ultra-rare genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Palovarotene, which received rare pediatric disease and breakthrough therapy designations from the FDA for the potential treatment of FOP, was acquired by Ipsen through the acquisition of Clementia Pharmaceuticals in April 2019.

<b>Ipsen’s Forward Looking Statement</b>

The forward-looking statements, objectives and targets contained herein are based on the Group’s management strategy, current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect the Group’s future ability to achieve its financial targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ""believes"", ""anticipates"" and ""expects"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including the Group’s expectations regarding future events, including regulatory filings and determinations, and the outcome of this study or other studies. Moreover, the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by the Group. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably for regulatory or competition reasons. The Group must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore, the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that the Group may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore, the Group cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of 6 pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the Group's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the Group’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. The Group also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to the Group’s activities and financial results. The Group cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of the Group’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on the Group’s business, financial position or performance. The Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements, targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, unless so required by applicable law. The Group’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to the Group’s 2019 Universal Registration Document available on its website (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipsen.com&amp;esheet=52437414&amp;newsitemid=20210528005422&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.ipsen.com&amp;index=2&amp;md5=696fc069650fcb065156662b859b526b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.ipsen.com</a>).

<span class=""xn-location"">MONTREAL</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">May 31, 2021</span> /CNW/ - Bristol Myers Squibb Canada (BMS) today announced Health Canada has granted conditional approval (NOC/c) for ABECMA<sup>TM</sup> (idecabtagene vicleucel; ide-cel) as the first and only B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy for adults with multiple myeloma (MM). ABECMA<sup>TM</sup> is indicated for MM patients who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and who are refractory to their last treatment.<sup>2</sup> This conditional approval is based on the results of the pivotal Phase II KarMMa study which demonstrated ABECMA<sup>TM</sup>'s ability to deliver rapid, deep and durable responses with a single infusion.<sup>3
</sup>

""Today's approval is an important milestone in the treatment of multiple myeloma in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>,"" says Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Christine Chen</span>, Medical Director of Clinical Immune Effector Cell Therapy at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. ""Unlike traditional treatments, ABECMA<sup>TM</sup> is a one-time infusion. That means the therapy continues to put pressure on the disease while sparing patients the need for multiple treatment cycles. It offers them a treatment-free interval where they can experience a more normal life.""

&nbsp;

ABECMA<sup>TM</sup>, a CAR T therapy, uses patients' T cells to create a personalized version of their own immune system, potentially improving the chances of anti-tumour response long after treatment administration.<sup>4,5,6,7</sup> As an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy, ABECMA<sup>TM</sup> recognizes and binds to BCMA, a protein that is nearly universally expressed on cancer cells in MM, leading to the death of BCMA-expressing cells.<sup>8</sup>

""Nine Canadians are diagnosed with multiple myeloma every single day, but despite the growing prevalence, current treatment options are not enough and there continues to be a critical unmet need for patients who have received many therapies,"" says <span class=""xn-person"">Martine Elias</span>, Executive Director, Myeloma Canada. ""Introducing CAR T therapy means there is now an important new option for Canadians living with advanced multiple myeloma.""

MM is a hematologic cancer which develops when a buildup of malignant plasma cells forms in the bone marrow and limits the ability for other blood cells to develop and work normally.<sup>9</sup> In 2020 alone, an estimated 3,400 Canadians were diagnosed with MM,<sup>10</sup> and an estimated 7,460 currently live with MM.<sup>11</sup> An incurable disease that mutates over time, the natural progression of multiple myeloma is for patients to experience relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM). This results in an increased burden of disease and decreased depth and duration of response to each successive line of therapy.<sup>12,13,14,15,16,17 </sup>

""ABECMA<sup>TM</sup> is the first of a portfolio of CAR T therapies BMS currently has in development, addressing the needs of patients who have limited treatment options,"" says <span class=""xn-person"">Al Reba</span>, General Manager, Bristol Myers Squibb Canada. ""Working with our network of treatment facilities across <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, this approval is a critical step in our journey to bring innovative cell therapies to Canadians living with advanced blood cancers such as multiple myeloma.""

Health <span class=""xn-location"">Canada's</span> approval of ABECMA<sup>TM</sup> is based on the results of the Phase II KarMMa trial of 122 patients with RRMM who received at least three prior therapies including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and who were refractory to their last treatment.<sup>18</sup> The conditional approval is based upon the overall response rate, complete response rate, and durability of response.<sup>19</sup> Patients included in the trial were heavily pretreated with 84% being refractory to all three classes of treatment.<sup>20</sup> The median duration of follow-up throughout the KarMMa trial was 13.3 months.<sup>21</sup> ABECMA demonstrated an overall response rate of 74% and a complete response (CR) rate of 32%.<sup>22</sup> The onset of response was rapid with a median time to response of one month.<sup>23</sup>

Median duration of response was 11 months in those who achieved a partial response (PR) or better and 19 months for those who achieved a CR.<sup>24</sup> An improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival has not yet been established.<sup>25</sup>

The safety profile of ABECMA<sup>TM</sup> was generally manageable <sup>26</sup> with, most adverse events occurring in the first 8 weeks of therapy, except for those of hypogammaglobulinemia and infections.<sup>27</sup> The most common nonlaboratory AEs included cytokine release syndrome (CRS), infections – pathogen unspecified, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, viral infections, encephalopathy, pyrexia, cough, decreased appetite, headache, edema and hypogammaglobulinemia.<sup>28</sup> Serious AEs occurred in 67% of patients.<sup>29</sup> The most common serious AEs included CRS, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and febrile neutropenia.<sup>30</sup> The most common Grade 3 or 4 nonlaboratory AEs were febrile neutropenia and infections – pathogen unspecified.<sup>31</sup> In patients with persistent neutropenia the median time to recovery was 1.9 months.<sup>32</sup> In patients with persistent thrombocytopenia, the median time to recovery was 2.1 months.<sup>33</sup>

<p align=""justify""><strong>P</strong><strong>ARIS</strong><strong> – </strong><strong>JUNE </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> 20</strong><strong>21</strong> – A pivotal Phase 2/3 study of venglustat in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) did not meet futility criteria, and the company has halted the clinical program in ADPKD. The safety profile of venglustat remains consistent with previously reported results with more than 500 patients treated to date over a period of up to four years across all clinical programs. Biomarker data from the study confirmed venglustat effectively inhibits the glycosphingolipid (GSL) pathway by demonstrating a reduction in GL-1, a lipid that accumulates in certain cells.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The STAGED-PKD study was stopped for futility following an independent analysis of the annualized rate of change in total kidney volume (TKV) in patients receiving venglustat compared to placebo. Trends from the analysis showed venglustat did not provide a meaningful reduction in TKV growth rate, the primary endpoint of stage 1 of the Phase 2/3 study. This interim analysis suggests the reduction of GSLs may not play a significant role in the prevention of kidney cyst growth, and as such, may not be a primary pathway associated with the progression of ADPKD. The investigational research of venglustat in ADPKD was an attempt to explore a novel biological role for GSLs beyond the established role of these lipids in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs).

<em>“</em><em>The </em><em>venglustat</em><em> development program started with our confidence in the promise </em><em>of a</em><em> potential breakthrough treatment to address the unmet needs of people living with </em><em>lysosomal storage disorders</em><em>,” </em>said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. <em>“</em><em>In parallel, we</em> <em>set out to evaluate</em> <em>venglustat</em> <em>in</em><em> autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, </em><em>a leading cause of kidney transplant. </em><em>This outcome is not </em><em>what</em><em> we hoped for, especially for these patients. However, </em><em>our</em><em> research has furthered the scientific understanding of ADPKD by </em><em>demonstrating that modulating</em><em> the GSL pathway </em><em>is insufficient to restore kidney function in adults affected by </em><em>this disease.”</em></p>
Sanofi has both completed and active studies evaluating venglustat in Gaucher disease type 3, Fabry disease and GM2 Gangliosidosis. These diseases are LSDs caused by inherited genetic abnormalities. The abnormal accumulation of GSLs is central to certain LSDs and therapeutics promoting the clearing of these accumulated lipids have been validated in Fabry disease and Gaucher disease through clinical research. In this context, venglustat operates as a Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT), which is a concept that has also been previously validated for certain LSDs.
<p align=""justify""><strong>About </strong><strong>venglustat</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">GSLs are cellular building blocks whose abnormal accumulation is implicated in several rare diseases, responsible for both cell dysfunction and disease progression. Venglustat is a novel, oral investigational therapy that has the potential to slow the progression of certain diseases by inhibiting abnormal GSL accumulation. Venglustat is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","NEW HAVEN, Conn., May 27, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved NURTEC® ODT (rimegepant 75 mg) for the preventive treatment of migraine. NURTEC® ODT is indicated for adult patients with episodic migraine, e.g. those who experience less than 15 headache days per month. The approved product label was also expanded to include the use of NURTEC ODT 75 mg up to 18 doses/month, allowing for both acute and preventive therapy in the same patient.  This new approval makes NURTEC ODT the first oral CGRP antagonist approved for the preventive treatment of migraine, and the only migraine medication approved as a dual therapy for both the acute and preventive treatment. NURTEC ODT is approved for acute treatment in all eligible adult patients with migraine, regardless of the number of monthly migraine days. Since approximately 95% of all U.S. migraine patients experience less than 15 headache days per month, the new indication of preventive treatment significantly expands the market potential of NURTEC ODT and provides a new preventive treatment option for the vast majority of people living with migraine.

Peter J. Goadsby, M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc., Professor of Neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles and King’s College London, recipient of the 2021 Brain Prize for his groundbreaking research discovering the role of CGRP in migraine, and co-author of the Phase 3 preventive study published in The Lancet, commented, “The FDA approval of NURTEC ODT for the preventive treatment of migraine–along with its acute treatment indication–is one of the most groundbreaking things to happen to migraine treatment in my 40 years of practicing headache medicine. To have one medication patients can use to treat and prevent migraine will likely change the treatment paradigm for many of the millions of people who live with migraine.”

NURTEC ODT, with its novel quick-dissolve tablet formulation, works by blocking the CGRP receptor, treating a root cause of migraine. With this targeted mechanism of action, NURTEC ODT provides a more complete, flexible treatment plan that gives people with migraine increased control of their disease. A single dose of NURTEC ODT can deliver fast pain relief that lasts up to 48 hours for many patients. NURTEC ODT can be taken up to once daily as needed to stop migraine attacks or taken every other day to help prevent migraine and reduce the number of monthly migraine days. This approval represents an important advancement in care for the several hundreds of millions of people living with migraine across the globe. For the first time, one medication can treat and prevent migraine attacks.

Vlad Coric, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Biohaven noted, “This FDA approval marks the beginning of a new era for migraine treatments, allowing the potential for healthcare professionals to prescribe, and patients to have, a single medication to treat and prevent migraine attacks. NURTEC ODT is dissolving the line between acute and preventive treatment. This groundbreaking approach to treating the full spectrum of migraine disease, from acute therapy to prevention, can have a significant impact in a patient’s life by helping to decrease treatment plan complexity and reduce challenges with adherence and polypharmacy. At Biohaven, neuroinnovation is at the center of our focus and we are committed to finding and advancing paradigm shifting treatment options to help people with neurological diseases so they can live life without the burden of these illnesses.”

The FDA approval of NURTEC ODT is based on a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial with an open label extension. Primary study endpoint results demonstrated that NURTEC was superior to placebo, decreasing monthly migraine days by 4.3 days/month after three months of treatment. The preventive effects of NURTEC were seen as early as the first week of therapy. Further, a key secondary endpoint result showed that approximately half of NURTEC-treated patients had a 50% or greater reduction in the number of moderate-to-severe migraine days per month.

Carolyn Armitage, a NURTEC preventive clinical trial participant shared, “As a middle and high school teacher, I know how important it is to show up every day for my students. I value the opportunity my career provides me to help shape young minds and lives. But having a migraine attack almost three times a week has had a devastating impact on my professional and personal life. I wasn’t able to be present for my students, family or friends. After trying NURTEC ODT through the clinical trial, I’m so pleased that the frequency and severity of my migraine have subsided making them more manageable.”

In a pivotal trial for the preventive treatment of migraine, NURTEC was generally well tolerated with the most common side effects being nausea (2.7% vs 0.8% in placebo) and stomach pain/indigestion (2.4% vs. 0.8% in placebo). NURTEC ODT is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to rimegepant, NURTEC ODT, or to any of its components.

A recent survey, Preventing Migraine Attacks: A Current Perspective by the National Headache Foundation confirms that 84 percent of people currently taking a preventive treatment wish there was a better treatment option. Among respondents, 53% wanted more migraine free days and 67% reported that their risk of anxiety and depression increases as the number of migraine attacks increase. Nearly all respondents (98%) reported they are willing to consider a new oral treatment.

Biohaven Patient Access Commitment
NURTEC ODT is now available in pharmacies for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. People with migraine should talk with their healthcare provider about using NURTEC ODT to treat and prevent migraine attacks.

Biohaven is committed to supporting the migraine community by eliminating barriers to medication access. The company plans to continue the $0 co-pay card in which eligible people will pay as little as $0. For eligibility requirements and to enroll in the patient support program, please call 1-833-4-NURTEC or visit www.NURTEC.com.

About NURTEC ODT
NURTEC® ODT (rimegepant) is the first and only calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist available in a quick-dissolve ODT formulation that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura and the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults. The activity of the neuropeptide CGRP is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. NURTEC ODT is a CGRP receptor antagonist that works by reversibly blocking CGRP receptors, thereby inhibiting the biologic activity of the CGRP neuropeptide. The recommended dose of NURTEC ODT is 75 mg, taken as needed, up to once daily to treat or every other day to help prevent migraine attacks. For more information about NURTEC ODT, visit www.NURTEC.com. The most common adverse reaction was nausea and abdominal pain/indigestion. Avoid concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A or inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP. Avoid another dose of NURTEC ODT within 48 hours when it is administered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4.

Indication
NURTEC ODT orally disintegrating tablets is a prescription medicine that is used to treat migraine in adults. It is for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura and the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. It is not known if NURTEC ODT is safe and effective in children.

Important Safety Information
Do not take NURTEC ODT if you are allergic to NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) or any of its ingredients.

Before you take NURTEC ODT, tell your healthcare provider (HCP) about all your medical conditions, including if you:

have liver problems,
have kidney problems,
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant,
breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.
Tell your HCP about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

NURTEC ODT may cause serious side effects including allergic reactions, including trouble breathing and rash. This can happen days after you take NURTEC ODT. Call your HCP or get emergency help right away if you have swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, or throat or trouble breathing. This occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with NURTEC ODT.

The most common side effects of NURTEC ODT were nausea (2.7%) and stomach pain/indigestion (2.4%). These are not the only possible side effects of NURTEC ODT. Tell your HCP if you have any side effects.

You are encouraged to report side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.  Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1–800–FDA–1088 or report side effects to Biohaven at 1–833–4NURTEC.

About Migraine
Migraine is the 3rd most prevalent illness in the world and the World Health Organization classifies migraine as one of the 10 most disabling medical illnesses. Approximately 40 million people in the U.S., and hundreds of millions worldwide, suffer from migraine. Migraine is characterized by debilitating attacks lasting four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including pulsating headaches of moderate to severe pain intensity that can be associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia). There is a significant unmet need for new acute and preventive treatments as more than 90 percent of people with migraine are unable to work or function normally during an attack.

About CGRP Receptor Antagonism
Small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists represent a novel class of drugs for the treatment of migraine. This unique mode of action potentially offers an alternative to current agents, particularly for patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans, or who have a poor response to triptans or are intolerant to them.

About Biohaven
Biohaven is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, best-in-class therapies to improve the lives of patients with debilitating neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, including rare disorders. Biohaven’s neuroinnovation portfolio includes FDA-approved NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine and a broad pipeline of late-stage product candidates across three distinct mechanistic platforms: CGRP receptor antagonism for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine; glutamate modulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, and spinocerebellar ataxia; and MPO inhibition for multiple system atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

""Kyowa Kirin has a long legacy of partnering with other companies to deliver the full value of our scientific discoveries and novel medicines for patients,"" says <span class=""xn-person"">Masashi Miyamoto</span>, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer at Kyowa Kirin. ""KHK4083 is an important asset in our global pipeline. We know Amgen well, and this alliance will build on the past success and trust we have, bringing additional resources and therapeutic expertise to KHK4083's development and commercialization, to meet the needs of patients living with atopic dermatitis who seek alternative treatment options.""

KHK4083 is an anti-OX40 fully human monoclonal antibody discovered by Kyowa Kirin and engineered with Kyowa Kirin's patented POTELLIGENT® defucosylation technology to enhance its antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity.  KHK4083 has been shown to selectively deplete activated T cells that are critical in the development of atopic dermatitis.  Kyowa Kirin antibodies powered by POTELLIGENT technology with ADCC activity are currently marketed in therapeutic areas including Oncology and Asthma. This potent antibody-enhancement platform is also licensed to numerous third parties throughout the biopharmaceutical industry.

""Kyowa Kirin was one of Amgen's very first collaborators and we are delighted to be joining forces with them once again to advance this promising late-stage asset to treat atopic dermatitis,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Robert A. Bradway</span>, chairman and chief executive officer at Amgen.  ""We will take advantage of our two decades of experience in inflammatory disease, as well as our industry-leading human genetics capabilities, to help realize the full potential of KHK4083 as quickly as possible.""

Amgen is a global leader in treating inflammatory diseases, with a portfolio of marketed medicines that includes Otezla®, Enbrel®, AMGEVITA® (a biosimilar to Humira®), and AVSOLA® (a biosimilar to Remicade®).  Amgen's pipeline of investigational therapies includes tezepelumab (filed for U.S. FDA approval in <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2021</span> as a potential first-in-class treatment for severe asthma), ABP 654 (a biosimilar to STELARA®), and several innovative molecules in Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span> development for systemic lupus erythematosus and celiac disease.

""KHK4083 is another example of our world-leading expertise in antibody engineering, applied target selection and optimization. We are proud to be a science-led organization whose research capabilities continue to produce meaningful discoveries, while also taking advantage of open innovation, that offers potential for improving treatment paradigms,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Yoshifumi Torii</span>, Ph.D., executive officer, vice president, Head of Global R&amp;D Division at Kyowa Kirin. ""Results from clinical trials for KHK4083, including Phase 2 data, show great promise and we look forward to initiating a late-stage global program with Amgen to deepen our understanding of this asset.""

In 1984, Amgen and Kirin Holdings Co., Ltd (former Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd), the parent company of Kyowa Kirin, established a 50-50 joint venture to develop and commercialize EPOGEN® (Japanese brand name: ESPO®), which, in 1989, became the first Amgen medicine approved in the U.S., and, in 1990, became the first Kirin medicine approved in Japan.  Over time, the joint venture expanded to include the development and commercialization of several other medicines, including NEUPOGEN® (GRAN® in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>), Neulasta® (G-Lasta® in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>), Aranesp® (NESP® in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>), and Nplate® (Romiplate® in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>).  In 2017, the companies announced that the joint venture would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, with Kyowa Kirin in-licensing certain Amgen medicines in the <span class=""xn-location"">Asia-Pacific</span> region.

<b>About the KHK4083 Phase 2 Study</b>

In <span class=""xn-chron"">February 2021</span>, Kyowa Kirin reported that KHK4083 met the primary endpoint in a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical study conducted in the U.S., <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, and Germany.  The study included 274 patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, who were not adequately controlled with topical agents.  All KHK4083 cohorts achieved superiority to the placebo cohort for the primary endpoint of percent change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at 16 weeks with statistical significance. In addition, there was significant difference in the percentage of patients achieving an EASI-75 (EASI score of 75% or greater improvement from baseline) at 16 weeks and the percentage of patients achieving the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of 0 or 1 with an improvement of 2 points or more at 16 weeks in all KHK4083 cohorts compared to the placebo cohort. Sustained  efficacy of KHK4083 was observed beyond week 16.

Common treatment-emergent adverse events for KHK4083 cohorts were pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, worsening of atopic dermatitis and chills during the first 16 weeks. Pyrexia and chills events were mild to moderate in intensity, most of them were due to injection reaction and observed only after the first administration of the investigational product. There were no events of severe hypersensitivity reactions and no deaths observed in the study.

<b>About Atopic Dermatitis</b>

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic disease in which the immune system becomes disordered and overactive, triggering inflammation that damages the skin barrier.  People with atopic dermatitis can get rashes anywhere on the body that can ooze, weep fluid and bleed when scratched, making skin vulnerable to infection. Skin can become dry and discolored, and repeated scratching can cause thickening and hardening of the skin.  Atopic dermatitis typically begins in childhood, affecting 15% to 20% of children and 1% to 3% of adults worldwide.  The incidence of the disease has increased two- to three-fold since the 1970s.  People who have asthma and/or hay fever or who have family members who do, are more likely to develop atopic dermatitis.

<b>About OX40</b>

OX40 is a co-stimulatory molecule that is one of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family members.  It plays an important role in maintaining T cell proliferation and survival and in the formation of memory T cells.  OX40 is expressed on the surface of effector T cells (CD4 positive) activated by antigens.  It has been reported that effector T cells expressing OX40 are present in the lesions of atopic dermatitis.

<b>Amgen Forward-Looking Statements</b>

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, or the collaboration with Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. to jointly develop and commercialize KHK4083, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Amgen's business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.

Amgen's results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen's products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen's research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen's business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen's business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in <span class=""xn-location"">Puerto Rico</span>, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for Amgen's manufacturing activities, the distribution of Amgen's products, the commercialization of Amgen's product candidates, and Amgen's clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on Amgen's product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen's products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen's distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen's products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen's efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology Amgen has acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen's systems and Amgen's data. Amgen's stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect Amgen's business. Amgen's business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to Amgen's product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for Amgen's products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

Pratteln, Switzerland, and Rockville, MD, USA, June 1, 2021 – Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN)
and ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc (US: private) announce positive key results from the VISION-DMD
study, demonstrating robust efficacy across multiple efficacy endpoints and favorable safety and
tolerability of vamorolone in the treatment of patients with DMD.
VISION-DMD is a pivotal Phase 2b study designed to demonstrate efficacy and safety of vamorolone
compared to placebo and prednisone (active control) in the treatment of DMD. In the first 24-week
double-blind period, of which the topline data readout is presented here, 121 ambulant boys aged 4 to
&lt;7 years with DMD were randomized to receive vamorolone (low dose 2 mg/kg/day or high dose
6 mg/kg/day) or prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) or placebo. A second period of 24 weeks, where all
participants receive vamorolone treatment on either of the two dose levels, will continue to capture
additional longer term safety and tolerability data.
Vamorolone demonstrates efficacy across primary and secondary endpoints and over a broad dose
range
The study met its primary endpoint of superiority in change of time to stand from supine positioning to
standing (TTSTAND) velocity with vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day versus placebo (p=0.002) with a treatment
difference of 0.06 [95% CI: 0.02–0.10] rises/second from baseline. This corresponds to a clinically
relevant improvement in TTSTAND in the vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day group from 6.0 to 4.6 seconds and a
corresponding deterioration in the placebo group from 5.4 to 5.5 seconds. The study also demonstrated
superiority of vamorolone versus placebo across multiple secondary endpoints which include (in the
order of pre-defined hierarchy): TTSTAND velocity for 2 mg/kg/day (p=0.02), 6MWT for 6 mg/kg/day
(p=0.003) and 2 mg/kg/day (p=0.009), TTRW for 6 mg/kg/day (p=0.002). The clinical results establish the
efficacy of vamorolone over a wide, threefold dose range from 2 to 6 mg/kg/day. No statistically
significant differences were observed between vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day and prednisone across the
above endpoints.
Santhera and ReveraGen Announce Positive and Statistically Highly Significant Topline Results
in Favor of Vamorolone in Pivotal VISION-DMD Study
June 1, 2021 / Page 2 of 5
Vamorolone showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile over prednisone
The study completion rate at 24 weeks was 94% (or 114 of 121 participants). Vamorolone at both doses
of 2 and 6 mg/kg/day showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile. In the vamorolone groups, no
grade 3 or higher treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or adverse events leading to study
discontinuation were observed. The total number of TEAEs was lower in the vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day
(events n=96) and 6 mg/kg/day (n=91) groups compared to prednisone (n=120). In a prespecified analysis
of clinically relevant adverse events (moderate, severe, serious or leading to discontinuation due to
safety), defined for the EMA and conducted by Santhera, vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day was significantly
superior to prednisone (n=6 vs n=19, p=0.02).
As previously published, in open-label studies of 2.5 years duration (113 patient years), vamorolone did
not show stunting of growth as reported with conventional corticosteroids. Particularly noteworthy, this
was validated in the current 24-week double-blind study where vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day versus
prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day showed a significant difference in growth velocity (p=0.02). “Stunting of
growth is a major concern of families and patients treated with corticosteroids, and we are delighted to
see this superiority of vamorolone proven in this double-blind study,” said Paula Clemens, MD, study
Co-Chair, and Vice Chair of VA Affairs and Professor of Neurology, University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine.
“Today’s news is a tremendous milestone for patients and Santhera as we further advance vamorolone
as a foundational treatment option in DMD. The treatment effect translates into the potential to delay
disease progression by about two years and indicates disease modifying potential of vamorolone,” said
Dario Eklund, Chief Executive Officer of Santhera. “We now look forward to working with regulatory
authorities to bring vamorolone to DMD patients, first in the US and subsequently in Europe.
“We are thrilled about the positive results of the VISION-DMD study as it represents a culmination over
a decade of scientific research,” said Eric Hoffman, PhD, President and CEO at ReveraGen BioPharma
and Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Binghamton University – State University of New York. “We
are grateful to have been able to gather such important data and would like to thank all VISION-DMD
participants, their families and caregivers, as well as investigators and study personnel, for their
commitment to this ongoing program.”
“The strength of evidence for both efficacy and safety of vamorolone over such a wide dose range from
2 to 6 mg/kg/day allows clinicians to individually tailor treatment of Duchenne patients by starting at the
higher 6 mg/kg/day dose of vamorolone with equivalent efficacy to daily prednisone and titrate the dose
according to how well the treatment is tolerated whilst maintaining optimal efficacy. I am enthusiastic
that this approach may allow patients to avoid side effects that currently lead to discontinuing steroid
treatment, meaning they are able stay on for longer,” said Craig McDonald, MD, Professor and Chair,
Department of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation and Director of Neuromuscular Disease Clinics, UC
Davis Health, USA.
Santhera plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) in the US in Q1-2022, requesting a priority review
based on the fast track designation granted by the FDA. The VISION-DMD study continues to 48 weeks
and will, subject to a positive outcome, deliver data for the submission of a marketing authorization
application in Europe in Q2-2022. Upon approval, Santhera intends to commercialize vamorolone for the
treatment of DMD through its own organization in the United States and main markets in Europe, and is

seeking collaborations outside those regions for DMD and for additional indications worldwide. Santhera
estimates the peak sales potential for vamorolone in the indication DMD alone to be in excess of USD 500
million in the US and the largest five European countries combined.
Vamorolone has been granted Orphan Drug status in the US and in Europe, and has received Fast Track
and Rare Pediatric Disease designations by the US FDA and Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) status
from the UK MHRA. On September 2, 2020, Santhera signed agreements with ReveraGen and Idorsia
that granted Santhera an exclusive license to vamorolone for all indications worldwide.

About VISION-DMD
VISION-DMD is a 48-week Phase 2b study designed as a pivotal trial to demonstrate efficacy and safety
of vamorolone (2 and 6 mg/kg/day) versus prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) and placebo in 121 ambulant
boys aged 4 to &lt;7 years with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The topline results cover data from
the first period of 24 weeks of the study where vamorolone is compared to placebo (FDA-prerequisite
for filing an NDA) and prednisone. The primary endpoint of the study is TTSTAND velocity at 24 weeks
comparing the 6 mg/kg/day dose of vamorolone to placebo. TTSTAND velocity measures the speed at
which patients are able to stand up from lying in a supine position and is a strong and recognized marker
for muscle function. Secondary efficacy outcome measures include TTSTAND velocity for vamorolone at
the lower dose of 2 mg/kg/day, Six-Minute Walk (6MWT) and Time to Run/Walk 10 meters (TTRW) tests
at 24 weeks. The VISION-DMD study continues to completion at 48 weeks. During the second period of
this 48-week study, all participants receive vamorolone. Participants from the placebo and prednisone
arms are randomized to either the 2 or 6 mg/kg/day dose of vamorolone and the current vamorolone
arms continue on their existing dose. The final data readout is expected in Q4-2021. In addition to
efficacy, the study aims to confirm the favorable tolerability profile of vamorolone with the potential to
offer an alternative to current standard of care. Although glucocorticoids are part of the current care
recommendations for DMD, their adverse effect profile limits their use.
About Vamorolone
Vamorolone is a first-in-class dissociative steroid which retains the anti-inflammatory activity of
corticosteroids while decreasing the deleterious side effects. As such, vamorolone could emerge as a
promising alternative to existing corticosteroids, the current standard of care in children and adolescent
patients with DMD. There is substantial unmet medical need in this patient group as high-dose
corticosteroids have significant systemic side effects that diminish patient quality of life.

About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare inherited X-chromosome-linked disease, which almost
exclusively affects males. DMD is characterized by inflammation which is present at birth or shortly
thereafter. Inflammation leads to fibrosis of muscle and is clinically manifested by progressive muscle
degeneration and weakness. Major milestones in the disease are the loss of ambulation, the loss of selffeeding, the start of assisted ventilation, and the development of cardiomyopathy. DMD reduces life
expectancy to before the fourth decade due to respiratory and/or cardiac failure.

<span class=""xn-location"">EAST HANOVER, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 1, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Novartis, a leader in immuno-dermatology and rheumatology, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Cosentyx<sup>®</sup> (secukinumab) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients six years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy<sup>1</sup>. This is the first approval for Cosentyx in a pediatric population in the US. The Cosentyx clinical profile is supported by five years of adult data showing long-lasting efficacy and a consistent safety profile across moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis<sup>4-10</sup>.

""Treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children can be complicated, as we need to balance the ability of a treatment to provide symptom relief while considering the safety profile as the top priority,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">John Browning</span>, MD, FAAD, FAAP, MBA, clinical trial investigator, Adjunct Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Dermatology at the <span class=""xn-org"">University of Texas</span> Health, <span class=""xn-location"">San Antonio</span>. ""In the pediatric pivotal study, the majority of patients treated with Cosentyx were able to achieve clear or almost clear skin with a safety profile consistent with previous clinical trials in adults. Due to the systemic nature of the disease, Cosentyx is a welcome addition as a treatment option for families dealing with this challenging condition.""

Psoriasis is a common chronic, inflammatory condition which affects approximately 8 million Americans and 1% of children and adolescents in the US<sup>2,11</sup>. Onset is most common during adolescence, with one-third of psoriasis cases beginning in the pediatric years<sup>2,12</sup>. Psoriasis can have a negative impact on the quality of life of children, especially during their formative years<sup>13</sup>.

The approved pediatric dosing for Cosentyx is 75 mg or 150 mg depending on the child's weight at the time of dosing and is administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks after an initial loading regimen<sup>1</sup>. After initial counseling and proper training in injection technique, Cosentyx can be administered by an adult caregiver outside of a healthcare provider's office via a single-dose prefilled syringe or Sensoready<sup>®</sup> pen.

""Today's FDA approval represents an important milestone for Cosentyx demonstrating our commitment to help meet the needs of pediatric plaque psoriasis patients and their families,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Victor Bulto</span>, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. ""With more than 400,000 patients treated in over 100 countries worldwide, this expanded indication builds on the established safety and efficacy profile of Cosentyx.""

This Cosentyx approval is based on two Phase III studies evaluating the use of Cosentyx in children aged 6 to &lt;18 years with plaque psoriasis. The safety profile reported in these trials was consistent with the safety profile reported in adult plaque psoriasis trials. No new safety signals were observed.

The first study, which evaluated efficacy and safety, was a 52-week (236 weeks total), randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study which included 162 children six years of age and older with severe plaque psoriasis. The data showed Cosentyx reduced psoriasis severity at Week 12 compared with placebo as demonstrated by the following efficacy results by baseline weight strata for the approved doses (75mg for &lt;50kg and 150mg for =50kg): Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75 response (55% 75 mg vs 10% placebo (N=22 and N=20, respectively), 86% 150 mg vs 19% placebo (N=21 and N=21, respectively), 70% total Cosentyx vs 15% total placebo (N=43 and N=41, respectively) and Investigator's Global Assessment modified 2011 (IGA) ""clear"" or ""almost clear"" skin response (32% 75 mg vs 5% placebo, 81% 150 mg vs 5% placebo, 56% total Cosentyx vs 5% total placebo), co-primary endpoints of the study<sup>1</sup>.

The second Phase III study was a randomized open-label, 208-week trial of 84 subjects six years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis<sup>1</sup>.

""Living with psoriasis is challenging, and can be highly stressful for children and adolescents,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Randy Beranek</span>, President and CEO, National Psoriasis Foundation. ""Having expanded treatment options for this patient population is a step in the right direction to help reduce the burden of plaque psoriasis.""

<span class=""xn-location"">RARITAN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 1, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for teclistamab in the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This distinction for teclistamab, an off-the-shelf, T-cell redirecting, bispecific antibody targeting both B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD3 receptors, follows a PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) received earlier this year. Today's BTD marks the 11<sup>th</sup> received by Janssen's Oncology Therapeutic Area.

""We are pleased to have received Breakthrough Therapy and PRIME Designations for our novel bispecific antibody, teclistamab,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Peter Lebowitz</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""This program exemplifies our commitment to advancing science for patients living with multiple myeloma, and it builds upon our robust portfolio in this disease.""

The FDA grants BTD to expedite the development and regulatory review of an investigational medicine that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and is based on preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy.<sup>1</sup> PRIME designation offers enhanced interaction and early dialogue to optimize development plans and speed up the evaluation of scientific advances that target a high unmet medical need.<sup>2</sup>

The Breakthrough and PRIME designations are supported by data from the Phase 1 MajesTEC-1 study (NCT03145181), an open-label, multicenter clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of teclistamab in adults with measurable multiple myeloma that is relapsed or refractory to established therapies or be intolerant of those established multiple myeloma therapies.<sup>3</sup>

Updated results from the MajesTEC-1 study will be presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting on <span class=""xn-chron"">June 8</span>.

<b>About Teclistamab<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Teclistamab is an off-the-shelf, T-Cell redirecting, bispecific antibody targeting both BCMA and CD3 receptors. BCMA is expressed at high levels on multiple myeloma cells.<sup>4</sup><sup>,5,6,7,8</sup> Teclistamab redirects CD3-positive T-cells to BCMA-expressing myeloma cells to induce killing of tumor cells.<sup>5</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>6</sup> Results from preclinical studies demonstrate that teclistamab kills myeloma cell lines and bone marrow-derived myeloma cells from heavily pretreated patients.<sup>6</sup>

Teclistamab is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3179960-1&amp;h=2513525808&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04557098&amp;a=NCT04557098"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT04557098</a>) and is also being explored in combination studies (<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3179960-1&amp;h=218412728&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04586426&amp;a=NCT04586426"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT04586426</a>, <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3179960-1&amp;h=3024049728&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04108195&amp;a=NCT04108195"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT04108195</a>, <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3179960-1&amp;h=1452952762&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04722146&amp;a=NCT04722146"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT04722146</a>). In 2020, the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration each granted teclistamab orphan drug designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2021</span>, teclistamab was granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). PRIME offers enhanced interaction and early dialogue to optimize drug development plans and speed up evaluation of cutting-edge, scientific advances that target a high unmet medical need.<sup>9</sup>

<b>About Multiple Myeloma<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.<sup>10,11</sup> When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow. In 2021, it is estimated that nearly 35,000 people will be diagnosed and more than 12,000 will die from the disease in the U.S.<sup>12</sup> While some patients with multiple myeloma initially have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood cell counts, tiredness, high calcium levels, kidney problems or infections.<sup>13</sup>

<b>About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson<br class=""dnr"" /></b>At Janssen, we're creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, announced today that it has achieved full patient enrollment in its APOLLO-B Phase 3 study of patisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in patients with transthyretin-mediated (ATTR) amyloidosis. Enrollment was completed with over 300 ATTR amyloidosis patients across 90 sites in more than 20 countries. ATTR amyloidosis is a rare, progressively debilitating, and fatal disease that is caused by misfolded transthyretin (TTR) proteins that accumulate as amyloid deposits in multiple tissues, including the nerves, heart and gastrointestinal (GI) tract and encompasses hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis and wild-type ATTR (wtATTR) amyloidosis. hATTR amyloidosis is estimated to impact approximately 50,000 people worldwide and is a multisystem disease that can include sensory and motor, autonomic, and cardiac symptoms. wtATTR amyloidosis is estimated to impact between 200,000 and 300,000 people worldwide and primarily manifests as cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure and mortality. APOLLO-B is the industry’s furthest progressed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a TTR silencer investigational medicine for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in hATTR and wtATTR amyloidosis patients.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Patisiran is the established name for ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup>, which is approved in the United States, Canada and Japan for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults and in the European Union, Switzerland and Brazil for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adults with Stage 1 or Stage 2 polyneuropathy.

“The APOLLO-B trial was initiated based on encouraging data from previous studies that support further investigation of patisiran in ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. Specifically, encouraging results were obtained from the landmark Phase 3 APOLLO study in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy on a number of exploratory cardiac endpoints. Today’s milestone marks an important step forward as we continue to study the safety and efficacy of patisiran in the treatment of cardiovascular-related manifestations of ATTR amyloidosis, which can often be devastating for these patients,” said Rena Denoncourt, Vice President, TTR Franchise Lead. “We look forward to announcing topline APOLLO-B results in mid-2022 and are excited about the potential of patisiran to treat multiple manifestations of this rapidly progressive disease and further advance our aspiration to build the industry leading franchise of RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis.”

<b>About the APOLLO-B Phase 3 Study Design</b>

The APOLLO-B study is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter global study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patisiran in patients with transthyretin-mediated (ATTR) amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which enrolled over 300 adult patients with ATTR amyloidosis (hereditary or wild-type) with cardiomyopathy. Patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive 0.3 mg/kg of patisiran or placebo intravenously administered every three weeks over a 12-month treatment period. After 12 months, all patients will receive patisiran in an open-label extension period. The primary outcome measure of APOLLO-B is the change from baseline in the 6-minute walk test at 12 months compared to placebo. Key secondary and exploratory endpoints will evaluate the efficacy of patisiran on health-related quality of life, mortality and cardiovascular events, cardiac biomarkers and additional manifestations of cardiac amyloid involvement.

<b>About ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> (Patisiran)</b>

ONPATTRO is an RNAi therapeutic that is approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults. ONPATTRO is also approved in the European Union, Switzerland and Brazil for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adults with Stage 1 or Stage 2 polyneuropathy, and in Japan for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. ONPATTRO is an intravenously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting transthyretin (TTR). It is designed to target and silence TTR messenger RNA, thereby blocking the production of TTR protein before it is made. ONPATTRO blocks the production of TTR in the liver, reducing its accumulation in the body’s tissues in order to halt or slow down the progression of the polyneuropathy associated with the disease. For more information about ONPATTRO, including full Prescribing Information and Important Safety Information, visit <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onpattro.com%2F&amp;esheet=52437810&amp;newsitemid=20210601005231&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=ONPATTRO.com&amp;index=3&amp;md5=4f7ab795eb0adf9af82dadb52f0613cf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">ONPATTRO.com</a>.

<b>ONPATTRO Indication and Important Safety Information</b>
<i>Indication
</i>ONPATTRO is indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults.

<i>Infusion-Related Reactions
</i>Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been observed in patients treated with ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> (patisiran). In a controlled clinical study, 19% of ONPATTRO-treated patients experienced IRRs, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. The most common symptoms of IRRs with ONPATTRO were flushing, back pain, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and headache.

To reduce the risk of IRRs, patients should receive premedication with a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and antihistamines (H1 and H2 blockers) at least 60 minutes prior to ONPATTRO infusion. Monitor patients during the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRRs. If an IRR occurs, consider slowing or interrupting the infusion and instituting medical management as clinically indicated. If the infusion is interrupted, consider resuming at a slower infusion rate only if symptoms have resolved. In the case of a serious or life-threatening IRR, the infusion should be discontinued and not resumed.

<i>Reduced Serum Vitamin A Levels and Recommended Supplementation
</i>ONPATTRO treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels. Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin A is advised for patients taking ONPATTRO. Higher doses than the RDA should not be given to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment with ONPATTRO, as serum levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body. Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g., night blindness).

<i>Adverse Reactions
</i>The most common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with ONPATTRO were upper respiratory tract infections (29%) and infusion-related reactions (19%).

<b>About ATTR Amyloidosis</b>

Transthyretin-mediated (ATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, rapidly progressive, debilitating disease caused by misfolded transthyretin (TTR) proteins which accumulate as amyloid fibrils in multiple tissues including the nerves, heart, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There are two different types of ATTR amyloidosis – Hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis, caused by a TTR gene variant, and Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis (wtATTR), which occurs without a TTR gene variant. hATTR amyloidosis affects approximately 50,000 people worldwide, while wtATTR amyloidosis is estimated to impact 200,000 – 300,000 people worldwide.

<b>About RNAi</b>

RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

<div class=""rich-text"">

A new post-hoc analysis of pooled data from the TULIP Phase III clinical trials being presented at the annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR 2021) showed anifrolumab was consistently associated with improvements in both skin rash and arthritis across three different disease measures each, compared to placebo, in patients with moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).<sup>1</sup>

The analysis examined disease manifestations in the two most commonly impacted organ domains in SLE.<sup>2-3</sup> Anifrolumab is a potential first-in-class type I interferon inhibitor.

For skin rash, the difference in response rates for anifrolumab versus placebo at week 52 were 13.5% SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), 15.5% British Isles Lupus Assessment Group index (BILAG) and 15.6% modified Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (mCLASI). For arthritis, differences in response rates were 8.2% SLEDAI, 11.8% BILAG and 12.6% joint response.<sup>3</sup>

Joan Merrill, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Arthritis &amp; Clinical Immunology Research Program, US, said: “Arthritis and rash are the most common and persistent problems in lupus and often have a significant impact on a person's life. The strength of the data from this analysis is that anifrolumab was found to be consistently effective using three different ways of looking at rash and three different approaches to arthritis. Capturing multiple aspects of improvement increases confidence that anifrolumab may be an important option for patients.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “The data being presented at EULAR add to the growing body of evidence for anifrolumab that demonstrate a compelling clinical profile with the potential to address significant unmet medical needs in this debilitating disease. With no new systemic lupus erythematosus treatments in over a decade, we’re working to make this new medicine available as soon as possible.”

The most frequently reported adverse events for anifrolumab in the TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials were upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, infusion-related reactions and herpes zoster.<sup>4-5</sup>

AstraZeneca’s application for anifrolumab in SLE is under review by regulatory authorities in the US, EU and Japan, with decisions anticipated in the second half of 2021. Anifrolumab is not currently approved in any country.

<b>Systemic lupus erythematosus
</b>Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue in the body.<sup>6 </sup>It is a chronic and complex disease with a variety of clinical manifestations that can impact many organs and can cause a range of symptoms including pain, rashes, fatigue, swelling in joints and fevers.<sup>7</sup> More than 50% of patients with SLE develop permanent organ damage, caused by the disease or existing treatments, which exacerbates symptoms and increases the risk of mortality.<sup>8-9</sup> At least five million people worldwide have a form of lupus.<sup>10</sup> No new treatments have been approved for SLE in over 10 years.<sup>11</sup>

<b>TULIP-1, TULIP-2 in SLE
</b>The pivotal TULIP (Treatment of Uncontrolled Lupus via the Interferon Pathway) Phase III programme includes two trials, <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2018/update-on-tulip-1-phase-iii-trial-for-anifrolumab-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-31082018.html"">TULIP-1</a> and <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/anifrolumab-demonstrated-superiority-across-multiple-efficacy-endpoints-in-patients-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-phase-iii-tulip-2-trial.html"">TULIP-2</a>, that evaluated the efficacy and safety of anifrolumab versus placebo. Both were randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials in patients with moderate to severe autoantibody-positive SLE who were receiving standard therapy.<sup>4-5 </sup>Standard therapy consisted of oral corticosteroids (OCS), antimalarials and immunosuppressants (methotrexate, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, known as MMF). TULIP-2 demonstrated superiority across multiple efficacy endpoints versus placebo with both arms receiving standard therapy. In the trial, 362 eligible patients were randomised (1:1) and received a fixed-dose intravenous infusion of 300mg anifrolumab or placebo every four weeks. TULIP-2 assessed the effect of anifrolumab in reducing disease activity as measured by the BILAG-Based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) scale.<sup>4</sup> In TULIP-1, 457 eligible patients were randomised (1:2:2) and received a fixed-dose intravenous infusion of 150mg anifrolumab, 300mg anifrolumab or placebo every four weeks, in addition to standard therapy. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint based on the SLE Responder Index 4 (SRI4) composite measure.<sup>5</sup>

In SLE, along with the pivotal TULIP Phase III programme, anifrolumab continues to be evaluated in a long-term extension Phase III trial.<sup>12</sup> A Phase II trial of anifrolumab in SLE using subcutaneous delivery has been completed.<sup>13</sup> In addition, AstraZeneca is exploring the potential of anifrolumab in a variety of diseases where type I interferon plays a key role, including lupus nephritis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus and myositis.<sup>14</sup>

The analysis presented at EULAR included three different disease measures per organ domain.<sup>3</sup>

<b>Anifrolumab
</b>Anifrolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to subunit 1 of the type I interferon receptor, blocking the activity of type I interferons.<sup>15</sup> Type I interferons such as IFN-alpha, IFN-beta and IFN-kappa are cytokines involved in regulating the inflammatory pathways implicated in lupus.<sup>16-17</sup> The majority of adults with lupus have increased type I interferon signalling, which is known to be associated with disease activity and severity.<sup>16,18</sup>

AstraZeneca acquired global rights to anifrolumab through an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Medarex, Inc. in 2004. Medarex was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2009.

<strong>Basel, June 2, 2021</strong> — Novartis, a leader in rheumatology and immuno-dermatology, today announced 2-year positive results from the Phase III JUNIPERA study, demonstrating that Cosentyx<sup>®</sup> (secukinumab) significantly delayed time to flare vs placebo (<em>P</em>&lt;.001) in pediatric patients with juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) – two subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)<sup>2</sup>. The data will be presented as a late-breaker at the EULAR 2021 Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (Abstract #LB0004; oral presentation: Saturday, June 5, 8:10 AM CEST) <sup>2</sup>.

“Both JPsA and ERA are progressive, chronic, debilitating diseases with limited treatment options. JIA can impact the daily lives of children and teenagers, with over 30% of children with JIA finding it difficult to attend school due to their condition, and many children still having active disease as adults,” said Dr. Hermine Brunner, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and lead investigator of the JUNIPERA study. “The JUNIPERA data are encouraging and pave the way for an effective treatment option that delays the worsening of symptoms leading to improvement in quality of life for these children.”

The JUNIPERA study also demonstrated sustained efficacy for Cosentyx with more patients achieving and maintaining the JIA American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 30 and JIA ACR 70 responses from Week 12 to Week 104 vs placebo. Cosentyx demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no new safety signals reported in pediatric patients (age 2 to 17 years) with two years of treatment.

“JPsA and ERA are associated with high levels of pain and functional disability, which can impact children as young as two years of age. These new data in pediatric patients are an example of our continued commitment to reimagine the future of rheumatology for those with inflammatory rheumatic diseases,” said Todd Fox, Global Head of Medical Affairs Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology at Novartis.

Cosentyx is the first and only fully human biologic that directly inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA).

Regulatory submissions in Europe and the US are anticipated in the coming weeks. In August 2020, Cosentyx received EU approval as a first-line systemic treatment for pediatric psoriasis and recently received US approval for the same indication.

<strong>About the JUNIPERA study</strong><sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>
JUNIPERA is a two-year, three-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, Phase III study investigating the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in the juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) subtypes of juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA). The JUNIPERA study enrolled 86 children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of JPsA or ERA according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria. Patients were given open-label secukinumab 75 mg/150 mg (prefilled syringe at doses of 75 mg in patients &lt;50 kg and 150 mg in patients =50 kg) up until Week 12. In this treatment period 1, patients achieving at least JIA ACR 30 response then progressed onto treatment period 2. In treatment period 2, patients were allocated to one of two arms: secukinumab 75 mg/150 mg (depending on bodyweight) or placebo and responses observed up until Week 104.

The primary endpoint of the study was time to flare in the treatment period 2 (Week 12 to Week 104). Secondary endpoints in treatment period 1 (up to Week 12) included evaluation of JIA ACR 30/50/70/90/100 responses and each JIA ACR core component, change from baseline of the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS), and total enthesitis and dactylitis count. Additional secondary endpoints during treatment period 2 from Week 12 to Week 104 included: effect of withdrawing secukinumab treatment with respect to JIA ACR 30/50/70/90/100 response and inactive disease; secukinumab serum concentration; safety/tolerability and immunogenicity of secukinumab.

An extension study of secukinumab to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability up to four years in patients with JPsA and ERA is currently ongoing.

<strong>About Cosentyx</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (secukinumab)</strong>
Cosentyx is the first and only fully human biologic that directly inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)<sup>8,</sup><sup>11,</sup><sup>12</sup>. Cosentyx is the only biologic with proven efficacy in all six key manifestations of PsA<sup>8,13,</sup><sup>14</sup>.

Cosentyx is backed by more than 14 years of clinical experience and long-term five-year clinical data across three indications of psoriasis, PsA and AS, as well as real-world evidence<sup>6-8</sup>. These data strengthen the unique position of Cosentyx as a rapid and long-lasting comprehensive treatment across axial spondyloarthritis, PsA and psoriatic disease, with more than 400,000 patients treated worldwide with Cosentyx since launch<sup>9</sup>.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About Rheumatoid Arthritis</b>

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic and debilitating immune-mediated inflammatory disease that affects an estimated 23.7 million people worldwide.<sup class=""first-child"">10,11</sup> As the most common form of autoimmune arthritis, it causes pain, stiffness, swelling and loss of function in the joints.<sup>10,12</sup> Many patients with rheumatoid arthritis still do not achieve clinical remission or low disease activity targets.<sup class=""last-child"">13</sup>

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About SELECT-COMPARE<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1,14</sup></b>

SELECT-COMPARE is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RINVOQ compared to placebo and HUMIRA in adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to MTX and continued a stable background of MTX. Patients received background MTX and were randomized 2:2:1 to receive RINVOQ (15 mg, once daily), placebo or HUMIRA (given as a subcutaneous injection of 40 mg every other week).

The primary endpoints included the percentage of subjects achieving ACR20 and clinical remission (based on DAS28-CRP) after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo. Ranked secondary endpoints included change in the mTSS compared to placebo and a comparison versus HUMIRA in percentage of subjects achieving ACR50, low disease activity, changes in pain as measured by the Patient's Assessment of Pain (based on VAS) and changes in physical function, as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability-Index (HAQ-DI). The trial is ongoing and included a 48-week randomized, double-blind treatment period followed by an ongoing long-term extension study for an overall study length of up to ten years.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About the Integrated Safety Analysis<sup class=""first-child last-child"">2</sup></b>

The integrated safety analysis included pooled data from six randomized, controlled RINVOQ rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. Treatment-emergent adverse events, including adverse events of special interest were summarized for RINVOQ 15 mg (pooled), upadacitinib 30 mg (pooled), MTX and HUMIRA. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported as exposure adjusted event rates (events/100 PY), which included both incident and recurrent events, up to a cut-off date of <span class=""xn-chron first-child last-child"">June 2020</span>.

<b class=""first-child"">About RINVOQ<sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup></b><b> </b><b class=""last-child"">(upadacitinib)</b>

Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.<sup class=""first-child"">3,</sup><sup>15-21</sup> In human cellular assays, RINVOQ preferentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2.<sup>3</sup> In <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2019</span>, RINVOQ received U.S. FDA approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. RINVOQ is approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs); for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs; and for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. The approved dose for RINVOQ is 15 mg. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis are ongoing.<sup class=""last-child"">16-21</sup>

<b class=""first-child"">Important Safety Information about RINVOQ</b><b><sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup></b><b> </b><b class=""last-child"">(upadacitinib)<sup class=""first-child last-child"">3</sup></b>

RINVOQ is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients, in patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections, in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and during pregnancy.

Use in combination with other potent immunosuppressants is not recommended.

Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving upadacitinib. The most frequent serious infections reported included pneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of bacterial meningitis have been reported. Among opportunistic infections, TB, multidermatomal herpes zoster, oral/oesophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis have been reported with upadacitinib. Prior to initiating upadacitinib, consider the risks and benefits of treatment in patients with chronic or recurrent infection or with a history of a serious or opportunistic infection, in patients who have been exposed to TB or have resided or travelled in areas of endemic TB or endemic mycoses, and in patients with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection. As there is a higher incidence of infections in patients =65 years of age, caution should be used when treating this population.

Patients should be screened for TB before starting upadacitinib therapy. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiation of upadacitinib in patients with previously untreated latent TB or in patients with risk factors for TB infection.

Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes zoster, were reported in clinical studies. The risk of herpes zoster appears to be higher in Japanese patients treated with upadacitinib. Consider interruption of therapy if a patient develops herpes zoster until the episode resolves. Screening for viral hepatitis and monitoring for reactivation should be performed before starting and during therapy with upadacitinib.

The use of live, attenuated vaccines during, or immediately prior to therapy is not recommended. It is recommended that patients be brought up to date with all immunizations, including prophylactic zoster vaccinations, prior to initiating upadacitinib, in agreement with current immunization guidelines.

The risk of malignancies, including lymphoma is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancies, including lymphoma. The clinical data are currently limited and long-term studies are ongoing. Malignancies, including non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), have been reported in patients treated with upadacitinib. Consider the risks and benefits of upadacitinib treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated NMSC or when considering continuing upadacitinib therapy in patients who develop a malignancy. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup class=""first-child"">3</sup>, absolute lymphocyte count &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, or haemoglobin levels &lt;8 g/dL were reported in <u class=""last-child"">&lt;</u>1% of patients in clinical trials. Treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients with these haematological abnormalities observed during routine patient management.

RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients treated with upadacitinib should have risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.

Upadacitinib treatment was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

Treatment with upadacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. If increases in ALT or AST are observed during routine patient management and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded.

Events of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, including upadacitinib. Upadacitinib should be used with caution in patients at high risk for DVT/PE. Risk factors that should be considered in determining the patient's risk for DVT/PE include older age, obesity, a medical history of DVT/PE, patients undergoing major surgery, and prolonged immobilisation. If clinical features of DVT/PE occur, upadacitinib treatment should be discontinued and patients should be evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate treatment.

The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions were upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, nausea, blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased and cough. The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About HUMIRA<sup class=""first-child"">®</sup> in the European Union<sup class=""last-child"">22</sup></b>

HUMIRA, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, including methotrexate, has been inadequate.

<b class=""first-child"">Important EU Safety Information about HUMIRA</b><b><sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup></b><b class=""last-child""> (adalimumab)</b>

HUMIRA is contraindicated in patients with active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections and in patients with moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV). It is also contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients; serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported. The use of HUMIRA increases the risk of developing serious infections, including hepatitis B reactivation, which may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. Rare cases of lymphoma and leukemia have been reported in patients treated with HUMIRA. On rare occasions, a severe type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been observed and often results in death. A risk for the development of malignancies in patients treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. Rare cases of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, demyelinating disease, lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported in patients treated with HUMIRA. The most frequently reported adverse events across all indications included respiratory infections, injection site reactions, headache and musculoskeletal pain.

PLANEGG/MUNICH, Germany &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MorphoSys AG (FSE: MOR; NASDAQ: MOR) (“MorphoSys”), and Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (NASDAQ: CNST) (“Constellation”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement whereby MorphoSys will acquire Constellation for $34.00 per share in cash, which represents a total equity value of $1.7 billion. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the management board (<i>Vorstand</i>) and the supervisory board (<i>Aufsichtsrat</i>) of MorphoSys, as well as the Board of Directors of Constellation and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Constellation is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using its expertise in epigenetics to discover and develop novel therapeutics that address serious unmet medical needs in patients with various forms of cancer. Constellation’s two lead product candidates, pelabresib (CPI-0610), a BET inhibitor, and

CPI-0209, a second-generation EZH2 inhibitor, are in mid- to late-stage clinical trials and have broad therapeutic potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients with various hematological and solid tumors. Pelabresib has the potential to be a first- and best-in-class BET inhibitor and is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials for myelofibrosis, a bone marrow cancer that disrupts the body’s normal production of blood cells. CPI-0209 is currently in Phase 2 with best-in-class potential for treating hematological and solid tumors. Constellation’s pipeline also includes numerous preclinical compounds.

“This transformational acquisition represents a major step forward for MorphoSys as we bolster our position in hematology-oncology,” said Jean-Paul Kress, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of MorphoSys. “Both pelabresib and CPI-0209 have broad potential and we look forward to unlocking their full benefits for cancer patients. Our existing clinical and commercial expertise is ideally suited to accelerate Constellation’s programs, enabling us to maximize Constellation’s potential and bring these novel therapies to market. With Constellation’s high-potential product candidates, complementary R&amp;D capabilities, and outstanding team, we can further advance our mission in the fight against cancer.”

“We are proud that MorphoSys has recognized the strength of our team, our expertise in epigenetics, and our high-potential oncology development pipeline and discovery programs,” said Jigar Raythatha, President and Chief Executive Officer of Constellation. “Becoming part of MorphoSys creates an industry leader with commercial capabilities, a deep R&amp;D pipeline and complementary small molecule and biologics discovery and translational capabilities, as well as the financial strength to compete to win. Our shareholders will receive attractive, immediate and certain cash value for their shares, the employees of the combined entity will have a broader platform and greater opportunities, and patients will potentially benefit from innovative new therapies that address serious unmet needs.”

</ul>
<b>Transaction Details</b>

Under the terms of the merger agreement, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MorphoSys will promptly commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Constellation’s common stock at a price of $34.00 per share in cash. Following successful completion of the tender offer, MorphoSys will acquire all remaining shares not tendered in the offer through a second step merger at the same price as in the tender offer.

MorphoSys plans to pay an all-cash consideration for the transaction. The tender offer is not subject to a financing condition.

The purchase price of $34.00 per share in cash represents a premium of approximately 70% to Constellation’s volume-weighted average price for the last five trading days.

Consummation of the tender offer is subject to various conditions including a minimum tender of at least a majority of outstanding Constellation shares, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the receipt of any approvals or clearances required to be obtained under the applicable antitrust laws, and other customary conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021.

Following close, MorphoSys will remain headquartered in Munich, Germany, and will maintain a significant commercial and R&amp;D presence in Boston, Massachusetts.

<b>EAGAN, Minn. – </b>Today, Prime Therapeutics (Prime), a leading pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) serving nearly 33 million members across 23 Blue Plans, unveiled MedDrive™ a new medical drug management program that provides solutions to help its Blue Plan clients manage the high costs associated with medically billed drugs. With the growth of drug spend under the medical benefit, Prime believes that effective total drug management for health plans is paramount. Effective total drug management requires solutions that integrate the entire health care ecosystem through a strong collaborative model to optimize health care value. Prime designed MedDrive for this purpose by leveraging the market-leading, collective health care footprint of our Blue Plan clients and Prime’s core mission of serving our Blue Plan clients through a 100% transparent, unbiased PBM model.

“Drug prices are a major concern for many Americans. With use of high-cost specialty drugs on the rise, we must look beyond the pharmacy benefit and find new ways to better manage prices for drugs paid for on the medical benefit,” said Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina's Vice President of Pharmacy Services, Arif Khan. “This aligned collaboration will deliver improved affordability without compromising patient outcomes.”

The MedDrive program will be launched in multiple phases.  The first phase focuses on drug savings strategies through greater biosimilar drug adoption, most which are paid on the medical benefit. Other elements of the initial program include benefit designs that prefer lowest net cost non-biosimilar drugs, plus enhancements to predictive data analytics, medical sourcing opportunities, and consultation services.

“Biosimilars often have initial prices that are 15% to 35% lower than the reference products. This makes them a sustainable option that offers therapeutic benefits while helping to lower costs. But significant barriers to greater adoption remain today – including a fragmented approach to managing drugs under the medical benefit,” said Joseph Leach, MD, chief medical officer at Prime. “With MedDrive, Prime now offers a transparent, comprehensive medical drug management solution to harness the collective strength of our Blue Plan clients to drive greater adoption of biosimilars and implement other cost-saving strategies.”

“We’re eager to work with Prime and Blue Cross plans to improve the use of biosimilars and other lower cost, yet equally effective drug alternatives” said Dr. Paul Thurmes, MD, medical director of Minnesota Oncology.  “Just as generics transformed the marketplace years ago, so can biosimilars. Working together the cost savings can be far reaching while still allowing us to maintain the highest quality care for our patients.”

“Our experience demonstrates that biosimilars can deliver savings while offering patients safe and effective treatments,” added Leach, who, in addition to his role as Prime’s CMO, continues his practice at Minnesota Oncology. “But to overcome existing barriers, biosimilar adoption needs to be intentional. It needs to be driven and for all parts of the system to embrace new approaches to care.”",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prime_Therapeutics-1.jpg,Biosimilars,Prime Therapeutics,,Biosimilars|Biosimilar Uptake|MedDrive,publish,26-05-2021,2

<span class=""bw-dateline-wrapper"">PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span>Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) plus <i>Yervoy</i> (ipilimumab) for the first-line treatment of adults with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The EC’s decision is based on results from the CheckMate -743 trial, the first and only positive Phase 3 study of an immunotherapy in first-line MPM. The trial met its primary endpoint, showing superior overall survival (OS) with <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> versus chemotherapy (pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin) in all randomized patients. The safety profile for <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy </i>in first-line MPM<i></i>was manageable using established adverse event management protocols and consistent with previous studies of the combination in other tumor types.

“After many years of limited progress in the treatment of malignant mesothelioma, we saw an important clinical benefit for patients with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate -743 trial,” said Paul Baas, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Thoracic Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute and the University of Leiden. “With the European Commission approval of this dual immunotherapy combination, patients and doctors will now have a new treatment option that has shown significant improvements in survival to manage this resistant disease.”

The EC decision allows for the use of <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> in first-line unresectable MPM in the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In addition to the EU, the combination has been approved in six countries, including the United States, and additional regulatory applications are under review by global health authorities.

“Mesothelioma can be a devastating diagnosis for patients and their families, and the disease has a significant impact throughout Europe, which has the highest incidence rate of mesothelioma globally,” said Stefania Vallone, board member, Women Against Lung Cancer in Europe. “Mesothelioma is often detected decades after exposure to asbestos, and for years these patients have faced this aggressive cancer with few treatment options. We are pleased to see a new therapy approved that may offer patients and their families hope for a longer life. Our wish is that it will soon be available in all European countries.”

“The European Commission’s approval of <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> is a crucial step in addressing the unmet needs of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. In the CheckMate -743 trial, this dual immunotherapy combination demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in survival over the standard of care, with 41% of patients who received <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy </i>still alive at two years, compared to only 27% with chemotherapy,” said Abderrahim Oukessou, M.D., vice president, thoracic cancers development lead, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We thank the patients and investigators involved in the CheckMate -743 trial, whose contributions were essential to bringing the first immunotherapy option to mesothelioma patients throughout the EU.”

 	<li><b>Progression-free survival (PFS): </b>The median time that patients lived without disease progression or death was 6.8 months with <i>Opdivo</i>plus <i>Yervoy</i> and 7.2 months with chemotherapy (HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.21).</li>
 	<li><b>Safety: </b>The most frequent adverse reactions, occurring in 10% or more of patients treated with <i>Opdivo</i>plus <i>Yervoy</i>, were fatigue (43%), diarrhea (31%), rash (30%), musculoskeletal pain (27%), nausea (24%), decreased appetite (24%), pruritus (21%), constipation (19%) and hypothyroidism (13%).</li>
</ul>
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CheckMate -743</span></b>

CheckMate -743 is an open-label, multi-center, randomized Phase 3 trial evaluating <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> compared to chemotherapy (pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin) in patients with previously untreated malignant pleural mesothelioma (n=605). Patients with interstitial lung disease, active autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, or active brain metastasis were excluded from the trial. In the trial, 303 patients were randomized to receive <i>Opdivo</i> at 3 mg/kg every two weeks and <i>Yervoy</i> at 1 mg/kg every six weeks; 302 patients were randomized to receive cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5 plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 in 21-day cycles for six cycles. Treatment in both arms continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or, in the <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> arm, up to 24 months. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival (OS) in all randomized patients. Additional efficacy outcome measures included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) utilizing modified RECIST criteria. Exploratory endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and patient reported outcomes.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</span></b>

Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare but aggressive form of cancer that forms in the lining of the lungs. It is most frequently caused by exposure to asbestos. Diagnosis is often delayed, with the majority of patients presenting with advanced or metastatic disease. Prognosis is generally poor: in previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma, median survival is between 12 and 14 months and the five-year survival rate is approximately 10%.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Opdivo</i></span></b>

<i>Opdivo</i> is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, <i>Opdivo</i> has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.

<i>Opdivo</i>’s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the <i>Opdivo</i> clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The <i>Opdivo</i> trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from <i>Opdivo</i> across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.

In July 2014, <i>Opdivo</i> was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. <i>Opdivo</i> is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Yervoy </i>combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Yervoy</i></span></b>

<i>Yervoy</i> is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. <i>Yervoy</i> binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <i>Yervoy</i> 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. <i>Yervoy</i> is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for <i>Yervoy</i> spanning multiple tumor types.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Important Safety Information</span></b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY . Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY . Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY . In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

<div class=""mfn-body"" style=""text-align: justify;"">

<strong>Ambition to generate positive operating cash flow monthly by late 2023/early 2024 and to initiate one new development program per annum</strong>
Leveraging the foundation established, Xbrane now set the ambition to initiate one new biosimilar development program per year. Xbrane applies a stringent selection process targeting blockbuster biologics with a realistic plan for launch at the time of patent expiry. There are multiple attractive opportunities to target – biologics with patent expiry 2028-2030 and estimated sales of +30bn euro in 2020. Leveraging its previously proven business model to partner at pre-clinical development stage on the back of comparative analytical data Xbrane expects to get meaningful co-funding of the clinical development. Based on this business model and expected net-income generated from Xlucane™, Xbrane has the ambition to generate positive operating cash flow monthly by late 2023/early 2024.

<strong>Xlucane™ on track towards regulatory submission in EU Q3 and US Q4 2021</strong>
Xlucane™ (Lucentis® biosimilar candidate) is currently in a pivotal phase III trial with expected top-line data mid 2021. Provided positive data Xbrane will, together with its partners STADA and Bausch + Lomb, proceed towards regulatory submission in Q3 and Q4 2021. If approved Xlucane™ could be launched subsequently across Europe and the US and tapping into the ophthalmic anti-VEGF-market estimated to more than 10bn euro. As earlier communicated, Xbrane has an ambition to generate +100m euro annually in net-income three years after launch.

<strong>New biotech lab established</strong>
Xbrane has established a new biosimilar development lab at Campus Solna outside Stockholm. This lab enables development of production processes for both mammalian cell- and E.coli-based biosimilars, as well as the advanced bio-chemical analytics required for developing biosimilars. Xbrane, together with other leading Swedish Life Science companies and organizations, will form a large cluster in the new Campus Solna focusing on development and innovation in the Life Science sector. Campus Solna is part of the multibillion “Hagastaden” re-development project, north of Stockholm, which includes the new Karolinska Hospital, Karolinska Institute, new apartments and offices. With its team of +50 professionals with capabilities to take biosimilars from cell-line to approval and its patented high yield/low-cost platform technology Xbrane has set the foundation for further growth.

<strong>Capital Markets Day</strong>
Xbrane will host a virtual capital markets day for investors, analysts and journalists tomorrow on May 17, 2021, 14.00-15.30 CET.

<strong>Basel, June 2, 2021</strong> — Novartis today announced robust data from the primary analysis of the pivotal Phase II ELARA trial of Kymriah<sup>® </sup>(tisagenlecleucel) in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL)<sup>1</sup>. Data will be presented as an oral presentation during the 2021 Annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Virtual Scientific Meeting (Abstract #7508; oral presentation: Monday, June 7, 10:30 AM CDT).

“Patients with follicular lymphoma who do not respond to their current treatment or who relapse early after treatment often have to endure multiple treatments, which can result in diminished clinical outcomes with each successive therapy,” said Stephen J. Schuster, MD, the Robert and Margarita Louis-Dreyfus Professor in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Lymphoma Clinical Care and Research in Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine and director of the Lymphoma Program at the Abramson Cancer Center. Schuster will present the results at ASCO. “Our goal as researchers is to continue to explore the potential of CAR-T therapy, and the robust ELARA safety and efficacy findings suggest Kymriah may play an important role in the third-line treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.”

In the primary ELARA analysis, 97 patients were infused and evaluated for safety, 94 patients were evaluable for efficacy with a median follow-up of 11 months. Importantly, no patients experienced grade 3/4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), the most common side effect associated with CAR-T therapy. Grade 1 or 2 CRS, as defined by the Lee Scale, occurred in 49% of patients. Grade 1 or 2 neurological events (NEs) (per CTCAE v4.03) occurred in 9% of patients and one patient experienced grade 4 NEs and recovered. Sixty-five percent of patients experienced grade =3 adverse events within 8 weeks post-infusion, most commonly neutropenia (28%) and anemia (13%). Three patients died from progressive disease and no deaths were treatment related. Kymriah was administered in the outpatient setting for 18% of patients in the ELARA trial<sup>1</sup><sup>,3</sup>.

Kymriah led to responses for the majority of patients treated, with 66% achieving a complete response (CR) (95% CI, 56-75). The overall response rate was 86% (95% CI, 78-92). Response rates were consistent across high-risk patient subgroups. The median duration of response (DOR) in all responders (95% CI, NE-NE), progression free survival (PFS) (95% CI, 12.1-NE), and overall survival (OS) (95% CI, NE-NE) were not reached. Estimated DOR in patients with CR and PFS rates at six months were 94% (95% CI, 82-98) and 76% (95% CI, 65-84), respectively. Efficacy findings include data from nearly twice as many patients as were reported at the interim analysis, including high-risk and heavily pretreated patients who continued to relapse or have refractory disease despite exposure to numerous prior lines of therapy. The median number of prior therapies was 4 (range, 2-13), 78% of patients were refractory to their last treatment (76% to =2 prior regimens) and 60% progressed within 2 years of initial anti-CD20-containing treatment<sup>1</sup><sup>,3</sup>.

“The strength of these pivotal results from the ELARA trial underscore the promising potential of Kymriah in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma,” said Stefan Hendriks, Global Head Cell &amp; Gene, Novartis Oncology. “With deep experience in CAR-T cell therapy and the largest global manufacturing footprint, Novartis is boldly committed to bringing the benefits of Kymriah to more patients with advanced blood cancers, and we look forward to advancing global regulatory submissions in this indication as quickly as possible.”

<strong>About Follicular Lymphoma</strong>
Follicular lymphoma (FL), the second most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), is an indolent lymphoma, and represents approximately 22% of NHL cases<sup>2,</sup><sup>4</sup>. Despite new treatments that improve overall survival, FL is regarded as an incurable malignancy with a relapsing and remitting pattern<sup>5</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>6</sup>. Throughout the lifetime of a patient with relapsing FL, they may be exposed to a median of five lines of prior treatment, with an upper range of 12 lines<sup>7</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>8</sup>. Although patients in third or later line treatment for FL have multiple systemic therapies available, the efficacy of these regimens drops off rapidly in later lines<sup>2</sup>. Additionally, because of this relapsing and remitting pattern, patients who are refractory to treatment or quickly relapse may exhaust available treatment options<sup>6</sup>.

<strong>About the ELARA trial</strong>
ELARA is a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label trial investigating the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in adult patients with r/r FL. This international trial has enrolled patients from over 30 sites in 12 countries worldwide. The primary endpoint is CRR based on best response by central review (Lugano 2014 criteria). Patients evaluable for efficacy had measurable disease at infusion and more than six months of follow-up from infusion or discontinued early. After infusion, disease assessments were performed every three months. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival and safety.

In Q2 2020, the FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to Kymriah in r/r FL, based on preliminary results from the ELARA trial. RMAT designation is intended to expedite the development and review of Kymriah as a regenerative therapy for this underserved patient population. Kymriah also has Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for this disease.

<strong>About Kymriah</strong>
Kymriah is the first-ever FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy, and the first-ever CAR-T to be approved in two distinct indications. It is a one-time treatment designed to empower patients’ immune systems to fight their cancer. Kymriah is currently approved for the treatment of r/r pediatric and young adult (up to and including 25 years of age) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and r/r adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)<sup>9</sup>.

<strong>About Novartis Commitment to Oncology Cell &amp; Gene</strong>
Novartis has a mission to reimagine medicine by bringing curative cell &amp; gene therapies to patients worldwide. Novartis has a deep CAR-T pipeline and ongoing investment in manufacturing and supply chain process improvements. With active research underway to broaden the impact of cell and gene therapy in oncology, Novartis is going deeper in hematological malignancies, reaching patients with other cancer types and evaluating next-generation CAR-T cell therapies that focus on new targets and utilize new technologies.

This comprehensive, integrated footprint strengthens the flexibility, resilience and sustainability of the Novartis manufacturing and supply chain.

<strong>Kymriah</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (tisagenlecleucel) US Important Safety Information</strong>
Kymriah may cause side effects that are severe or life-threatening, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or Neurological Toxicities. Patients with CRS may experience symptoms including difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, or dizziness/lightheadedness. Patients may be admitted to the hospital for CRS and treated with other medications.

Patients with neurological toxicities may experience symptoms such as altered or decreased consciousness, headaches, delirium, confusion, agitation, anxiety, seizures, difficulty speaking and understanding, or loss of balance. Patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if they experience any of these signs and symptoms of CRS or neurological toxicities.

Because of the risk of CRS and neurological toxicities, Kymriah is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called Kymriah REMS.

Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur after Kymriah infusion. Kymriah can increase the risk of life-threatening infections that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they develop fever, chills, or any signs or symptoms of an infection.

Patients may experience prolonged low blood cell counts (cytopenia), where one or more types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets) are decreased. The patient's healthcare provider will do blood tests to check all of their blood cell counts after treatment with Kymriah. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they get a fever, are feeling tired, or have bruising or bleeding.

Patients may experience hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition in which the level of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood is low and the risk of infection is increased. It is expected that patients may develop hypogammaglobulinemia with Kymriah and may need to receive immunoglobulin replacement for an indefinite amount of time following treatment with Kymriah. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their treatment with Kymriah before receiving a live virus vaccine.

After treatment with Kymriah, patients will be monitored lifelong by their healthcare provider, as they may develop secondary cancers or recurrence of their cancer.

Patients should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities for eight weeks after receiving Kymriah because the treatment can cause temporary memory and coordination problems, including sleepiness, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and seizures.

Some of the most common side effects of Kymriah are difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, confusion, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, dizziness/lightheadedness, and headache. However, these are not all of the possible side effects of Kymriah. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.

Prior to a female patient starting treatment with Kymriah, their healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test. There is no information available for Kymriah use in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Therefore, Kymriah is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and pregnancy.

Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

After receiving Kymriah, patients should be advised that some commercial HIV tests may cause a false-positive test result. Patients should also be advised not to donate blood, organs, or tissues and cells for transplantation after receiving Kymriah.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Toronto, ON /CNW/ – Biosimilars Canada today congratulated the Government of Quebec and Minister of Health and Social Services Christian Dubé for announcing the province’s intention to implement a biosimilar switching policy under its public prescription drug insurance plan.

The expanded use of biosimilars in Quebec is expected to generate annual savings of $100Mn as of 2022. These savings will be reinvested into the healthcare system and will also improve access to innovative drug therapies, according to Minister Dubé. Under the policy, patients who are being treated with an originator biologic drug for which a biosimilar biologic drug is available will switch to a biosimilar under the supervision of their treating physician by April 12, 2022. The government will be providing further details on its switching policy in the coming weeks.

Quebec is home to the second largest provincial drug plan in Canada, and is the fourth province to announce its intention to implement a biosimilar switching policy.

“Biosimilars Canada congratulates the Government of Quebec and Minister Dubé for prioritizing the expanded use of biosimilar medicines in the province to generate important savings and reinvest in Quebec’s healthcare system,” said Michel Robidoux, Chair of Biosimilars Canada.

Biologic medicines have revolutionized the treatment of many debilitating and life-threatening diseases, including arthritis, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. It can cost $10,000 to $25,000 or more to treat a single patient with a biologic drug for a year, which is placing an enormous financial strain on the province’s drug budget. The COVID-19 pandemic has also burdened healthcare systems and public finances like never before.

Switching to biosimilars represents an important way to control healthcare spending and fund coverage for new treatments, while supporting high quality patient care and treatment outcomes.

“Biosimilar switching policies are essential to ensuring the long-term sustainability of drug benefit plans and healthcare systems,” said Jim Keon, President of Biosimilars Canada.

British Columbia, Alberta and New Brunswick have implemented switching policies in recent years to ensure the use of cost-saving biosimilars1,2,3. Quebecers indicated their support for a provincial switching policy in a recent poll, with 85 per cent in favour of switching from originator biologic drugs to biosimilar biologic drugs.4

Switching from an originator biologic drug to a biosimilar is a safe and effective practice. Health Canada confirms that “patients and health care providers can have confidence that biosimilars are effective and safe for each of their authorized indications, and that no differences are expected in efficacy and safety following a change in routine use between a biosimilar and its reference biologic drug in an authorized indication.”5

There is extensive real-world experience with biosimilars in Canada, with more than 600,000 retail prescriptions filled annually, according to IQVIA data. Biosimilars are also used extensively in the hospital and oncology markets. There have also been more than 178 clinical trials worldwide involving approximately 21,000 switched patients which confirm that switching from an originator biologic drug to a biosimilar biologic drug is not associated with any major efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity issues.6

Biosimilars Canada looks forward to working with the government and supporting the implementation of the new policy as further details become available.

The Government of Quebec’s announcement is available at the following link and more information can be found on the ministry website here.

<p align=""justify"">BOUCHERVILLE, Quebec, May 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sandoz Canada, a leader in generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars, welcomes the Quebec Government’s shift towards biosimilars. <a title="""" href=""https://www.quebec.ca/nouvelles/actualites/details/le-ministre-christian-dube-annonce-un-virage-vers-les-medicaments-biosimilaires-31498"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>According to the government’s announcement</u></a>, this transition will generate annual savings of more than $100 for the public drug insurance plan and its insured parties. These savings will be reinvested in the healthcare system to improve access to innovative drug therapies, in particular.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Quebec is following the biosimilar transition policies implemented by British Columbia and Alberta in 2019 and, more recently, New Brunswick in 2021. With this announcement, the provinces that have adopted and implemented such a policy now make it possible for almost half of the Canadian population to benefit from it<sup>1</sup>. Under the Quebec initiative, the province will eventually cover only biosimilar drugs on formularies, with some exceptions, and will transition patients who use the reference biologic medicine to the listed biosimilar by April 12, 2022, under the supervision of their attending physicians.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“At Sandoz Canada, we are pleased to see that Quebec is adopting a switch policy already initiated by other provinces and is moving towards biosimilars. We are ready to support the government, physicians, pharmacists and all healthcare professionals with our six quality biosimilars, while helping to generate significant savings for the healthcare system,” said Michel Robidoux, President and General Manager, Sandoz Canada. “With COVID-19 placing our healthcare system under major budget constraints, biosimilar transition policies are an opportunity to contribute to the sustainability of health system financing and provide funding for new innovations,” he added.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The government has stated its intention to engage in discussions with key healthcare partners, and Sandoz intends to actively cooperate in these discussions. We want to share our experience with the Ministry in order to provide patients with the highest quality of care. It will also be an opportunity to clarify certain details of the shift towards biosimilars, in particular with the <a title="""" href=""http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=1&amp;file=104957.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>new regulation (section 80.2)</u></a> coming into effect as part of the Act respecting prescription drug insurance,” said Karine Matteau, Vice President, Bio-Generic Hospital/Physician channel and Head of Biosimilars at Sandoz Canada. “Sandoz is fully committed to supporting patients and their healthcare team during this transition period and beyond through our education initiatives and our patient support programs. We have set up a website for Canadians, <a title="""" href=""http://www.biosimilarsgeneration.ca/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>BiosimilarsGeneration.ca</u></a>, which contains a wealth of information and resources related to biosimilars,” she added.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Biosimilars</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">A biosimilar is a biologic medicine that has demonstrated it is highly similar and has no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety compared to the reference biologic already authorized for sale.<sup>2</sup> Biosimilars may become commercially available following the expiry of patents and data protection periods of the reference biologic medicine.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The Patented Medicines Pricing Review Board has estimated that private and public drug plans across Canada could save from CA$294 million to CA$1.136 billion by 2021 for established biosimilars<sup>3</sup> available in Canada for at least two years, and from CA$222 million to CA$447 million by 2023<sup>4</sup> for new biosimilars that recently entered the Canadian market.</p>

? Launch marks the World’s first biosimilar Antibody Drug Conjugate of Trastuzumab
Emtansine.
? The therapy will be priced at nearly 80% less than the currently available option in the market
? Developed in-house, the antibody drug conjugate is considered to be one of the most complex
technologies in drug development.
Zydus Cadila, a global innovation driven healthcare company, launched Trastuzumab Emtansine, the
first Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) biosimilar and a highly effective drug for treating both Early and
Advanced HER2 positive Breast Cancer, under the brand name ‘Ujvira’. HER2 positive Breast Cancer
is considered an aggressive form and constitutes 20 to 25% of all Breast Cancers.
In a step that can significantly reduce treatment cost by almost 80%, the drug is being offered at Rs.
32495 for a 100 mg vial. The current MRP of existing Trastuzumab Emtansine drug is Rs. 1,59,225 for
100 mg vial. Ujvira will be available in two strengths, 100 mg and 160 mg.
Speaking on this milestone, Dr. Sharvil Patel, Managing Director, Cadila Healthcare Limited said, “The
launch of Ujvira reinforces the innovation capabilities that India has to be able to create complex
therapies like ADCs and Zydus' ongoing commitment to offer breakthroughs backed by science and
innovation. This research breakthrough enables access to a critical drug for patients who are undergoing
therapy for Breast Cancer. We hope that with this innovation, patients will be able to adhere to the
treatment and stand to benefit from the advanced technology without worrying about the cost of the
treatment.”
Trastuzumab Emtansine ADC biosimilar is developmental breakthrough due to its complexity in
manufacturing and similarity assays. This drug is made by combining Trastuzumab and a cytotoxic
compound Emtansine (DM1) with the help of a stable linker by a process called Antibody Drug
Conjugation. Due to this technology the targeted delivery of the cytotoxic agent is enabled and the other
toxicities on body are reduced. Ujvira is backed up with rigorous drug development programme. Patients
already treated with Trastuzumab may still have the disease and would require this therapy as the next
step. The high cost of therapy is a barrier to availing this therapy and Ujvira bridges this need.
With more than 2.1 lakh new cases in 2020, Breast Cancer is the leading cancer in females in India and
the risk increases with age. It is estimated that 1 in 29 women in India has a risk of developing Breast
Cancer in her lifetime. Though rare, the incidence of HER2 Breast Cancer is also found in men. Other
risk factors such as obesity, family history, genetics, alcohol, smoking, hormonal imbalance and improper
diet have been identified as the contributing factors towards an increased incidence of Breast Cancer.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

INCHEON, South Korea--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Celltrion Healthcare today presented positive results from the Phase III CT-P17 3.1 trial comparing the efficacy and safety of biosimilar adalimumab,<i> </i>Yuflyma™, with reference adalimumab in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology 2021 (EULAR Virtual Congress 2021). The trial met its primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating that the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and immunogenicity of CT-P17, a high-concentration (100mg/mL), low-volume and citrate-free adalimumab biosimilar, is comparable to reference adalimumab in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe active RA up to one year. The abstract has been published in an official supplement of the Annals of Rheumatic Diseases (ARD).<sup>1</sup>

The randomised, double-blind, Phase III study has demonstrated therapeutic equivalence of CT-P17 to reference adalimumab in 648 patients with active moderate-to-severe RA, despite methotrexate treatment, who were randomised (1:1) to receive either 40mg of CT-P17 or reference adalimumab every two weeks up to week 24.<sup>2</sup> Prior to dosing at week 26, 608 patients were randomised again to either maintaining their treatment or being switched from reference adalimumab to CT-P17. After the second randomisation, 303 patients continued with CT-P17, 153 patients continued with reference adalimumab and 151 patients were switched from reference adalimumab to CT-P17 up to week 48.

Results demonstrated comparable efficacy in terms of ACR20/50/70 response rates, both in patients receiving maintenance therapy and in patients switched from reference adalimumab to CT-P17 up to week 52. With respect to PK, mean Ctrough levels were maintained after week 24 in all three treatment groups with the observed mean Ctrough levels recorded within the reported therapeutic ranges of reference adalimumab trough levels (5-8 µg/ml) in RA patients. The safety profile among the three treatment groups was comparable, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) being neutropenia and similar proportions seen across all treatment groups experiencing at least one TEAE: injection site reactions, hypersensitivity/allergic reactions and infections. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralising antibody (NAb) results were also similar among the three treatment groups; the proportions of patients who had ADA/NAbs were 28.4%/24.8% in CT-P17 maintenance, 27.0%/24.3% in reference adalimumab maintenance and 28.3%/26.3% in switched to CT-P17 groups.

Professor Jonathan Kay of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and Principal Investigator of the trial said, “CT-P17 is administered at 100 mg/mL, reflecting the high-concentration formulation of reference adalimumab, and is also citrate-free, which could lessen discomfort during injection. Demonstration of equivalent efficacy and comparable safety of CT-P17 to EU-sourced adalimumab in this study supports the ongoing clinical evaluation of CT-P17 as an adalimumab biosimilar.”

Celltrion are also pleased to announce that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorisation for Remsima<sup>® </sup>SC (infliximab) to be used without IV infusion both for new and existing RA patients.<sup>3</sup> The EC approval follows a positive Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), opinion issued for direct use of subcutaneous therapy without IV loading in adults with RA in March 2021.

“Celltrion now has biosimilars of both infliximab and adalimumab with value-added features, and thus CT-P17 could be used sequentially with Remsima<sup>® </sup>SC to bring clinical benefit for chronic diseases which require long- term treatment,” said Dr. HoUng Kim, Ph.D., Head of Medical and Marketing Division at Celltrion Healthcare. “Having both Remsima<sup>®</sup> SC and Yuflyma™ in our product pipeline furthers our efforts to deliver value-added medicines to both payers and patients.”

<b>Notes to Editors:</b>

<b>About CT-P17 (biosimilar adalimumab)</b>

CT-P17 is the first proposed high-concentration, low-volume and citrate-free adalimumab biosimilar. CT-P17 is indicated for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS (nr-axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis (PsO), paediatric plaque psoriasis (pPsO), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Crohn’s disease (CD), paediatric Crohn’s disease (pCD), ulcerative colitis (UC), uveitis (UV) and paediatric uveitis (pUV). CT-P17 is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that contains the active ingredient adalimumab. Adalimumab is a fully human anti–tumour necrosis factor a (anti-TNF-a) monoclonal antibody. CT-P17 provides pain-reducing features as it has a citrate-free formulation, meaning it causes less pain upon injection.

<b>About Remsima<sup>®</sup> CT-P13 subcutaneous (SC) formulation<sup>4,5</sup></b>

A 120 mg fixed dose of Remsima<sup>®</sup> SC has been granted marketing authorisation in the EU, in adults regardless of body weight, in all previously approved indications for the IV formulation. Remsima<sup>®</sup> SC has three administration options; via a pre-filled pen (auto injector), pre-filled syringe or pre-filled syringe with needle safeguard. The SC formulation has the potential to enhance treatment options for the use of infliximab biosimilar by providing high consistency in drug exposure and a convenient method of administration.

MEIJI SEIKA PHARMA: PROMISING RESULTS OF PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL OF DMB-3115, A PROPOSED USTEKINUMAB BIOSIMILAR, AND INITIATION OF PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL IN PATIENTS WITH PLAQUE PSORIASIS

Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, Japan, President and Representative Director: Daikichiro Kobayashi, “Meiji”) today announced that the bioequivalence of DMB-3115, a proposed ustekinumab biosimilar, has been demonstrated in phase I clinical trial compared to the reference products marketed in Europe and the United States. Meiji also announced the initiation of phase III multi-regional clinical trial in patients with plaque psoriasis. Those clinical trials are conducted in collaboration with Dong-A Socio Holdings (Headquarters: Seoul, Korea, CEO: JUNG Jae-Hun, “Dong-A”).

DMB-3115 is a proposed biosimilar to ustekinumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with several inflammatory diseases such as plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Meiji and Dong-A are co-developing DMB-3115 under the strategic collaboration partnership agreement on biosimilars signed in September 2011. DMB-3115 is produced by using Sp2/0 cells, the same as those used in reference products to achieve high similarity in quality aspects.

The Phase I clinical trial is a randomized double-blind, three-arm, single-dose study to compare pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of DMB-3115 with its reference products (US- and EU-marketed products) in 296 healthy volunteers at a single site in Europe. As a result, bioequivalence of DMB-3115 compared to reference products was demonstrated in terms of several pharmacokinetic parameters. A single subcutaneous injection of DMB3115 in healthy volunteers was well tolerated. The reported adverse events corresponded with the known safety profile of ustekinumab. There were no new unexpected adverse events.

The Phase III multi-regional clinical trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, with the target number of patient being 590, has been initiated in Europe and the United States. In this study, efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of DMB-3115 and reference products (45 mg or 90mg subcutaneous injection, respectively) are being compared in randomized, double-blinded controlled trial.

Meiji aims to contribute to medical care and society by developing and launching biosimilars with high quality as well as biologics products.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and GUANGZHOU, China, June 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Bio-Thera Solutions, Ltd. (688177.SH) today announced results from the Phase 3 study of BAT1806, a proposed biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA<sup>®</sup>/RoACTEMRA<sup>®</sup> (tocilizumab). The study met its primary endpoints, demonstrating equivalence to the reference medicine in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inadequately controlled by methotrexate therapy. The primary endpoint in the study was the American College of Rheumatology 20 percent response criteria (ACR20).

ACTEMRA/RoACTEMRA’s primary indication is for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults as well as juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, giant cell arteritis and cytokine release syndrome. Biosimilars are products that demonstrate similar efficacy and safety to the originator’s reference product, with the advantage that they can be more affordable for patients and healthcare systems. In 2020 global sales of ACTEMRA were 2.8 billion CHF. Biogen has exclusive regulatory, manufacturing and commercial rights to BAT1806 in all countries excluding China (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan).

“We are excited about these results and believe BAT1806 demonstrates equivalence in efficacy and pharmacokinetics as well as a comparable safety and immunogenicity profile to the reference product,” said Ian Henshaw, head of global biosimilars at Biogen. “Biosimilars have the potential to generate cost savings, healthcare sustainability and, if approved, BAT1806 would enable us to bring an additional therapeutic option to patients.”

“We are pleased to report on our third proposed biosimilar with positive Phase 3 study results. These results demonstrate the potential of our proposed tocilizumab biosimilar to be a safe and effective treatment,” said Shengfeng Li, Ph.D., chief executive officer at Bio-Thera Solutions. “Bio-Thera is committed to increasing patient access to innovative medicines through the development of high-quality biosimilars.”

Biogen and Bio-Thera announced a commercialization and license agreement in April 2021 to develop, manufacture and commercialize BAT1806. As satisfactory results were met, Biogen will make a payment of $30 million to Bio-Thera Solutions. Should certain commercial milestones be achieved, Bio-Thera Solutions will be eligible to receive potential milestone payments. Biogen will also pay Bio-Thera Solutions tiered royalties.

<strong>About Biosimilars</strong>

Biosimilars are biologic products that have been demonstrated to be similar in efficacy, safety and immunogenicity to the originator’s approved reference product, with the advantage that they offer cost savings to healthcare systems. Biosimilars may lower healthcare system costs broadly, creating headroom for innovation and could enable governments to potentially redirect savings to priorities such as increasing access to transformative therapies.

<strong>About BAT1806 Phase 3 Trial Design</strong>

The BAT1806 clinical trial was a global, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase 3 active-control study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, immunogenicity and PK of BAT1806 compared to ACTEMRA<sup>®</sup>/RoACTEMRA<sup>®</sup> in 621 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis with inadequate response to methotrexate.

The Federal Circuit previously ruled against Sandoz in a divided decision upholding Amgen’s patents.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We are disappointed the Supreme Court decided not to review our case,” said Keren Haruvi, President of Sandoz US and Head of North America. “Today’s decision means Erelzi, a more affordable biosimilar, will not be available to US patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases until 2029; nonetheless we remain committed to providing important treatment options for patients affected by these diseases.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With the trend towards increased spending on specialty medicines only expected to grow,<sup>1</sup> biosimilars play an important role in enabling more patients to access biologic medicines and may offer significant savings for patients, helping to alleviate the overburdened healthcare system.<sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>3</sup> Estimates suggest that a biosimilar etanercept could have saved the US healthcare system around USD one billion per year.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sandoz was the first company to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a biosimilar etanercept and the first to launch a biosimilar medicine in the US. Erelzi has been approved in the US for more than four years, since August 2016, however Sandoz has been unable to launch this medicine in the US due to the patent litigation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>About biosimilars</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A biosimilar is a successor to a biological medicine (known as the “reference medicine”) for which the patent has expired and exclusivity has been lost. Biosimilars have been shown to have equivalent efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity. Therefore, physicians and patients can expect the same clinical outcome.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>About Erelzi</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Erelzi is the Sandoz biosimilar of the reference medicine Enbrel<sup>®</sup>. Erelzi has been studied in a global development program, which included a comprehensive comparison of Erelzi and Enbrel<sup>®</sup> at the analytical, preclinical, and clinical levels. The program included preclinical studies, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, and the Phase III confirmatory safety and efficacy EGALITY study. Erelzi is being studied in a real world setting through COMPACT, a global non-interventional study conducted in countries such as Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Erelzi is approved by the US FDA for the following indications: adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO).</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","<div class=""bw-release-story"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">VIRGINIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alvotech today filed a federal lawsuit (Case 1:21-cv-00589) seeking to end the monopoly that pharmaceutical giant AbbVie has long-maintained on the adalimumab market, sold as Humira. Humira is the highest grossing prescription drug in the United States with over $16 billion in sales in 2020 (nearly $20Bn globally).</p>

<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“Our new product will be a gamechanger that will provide consumers who are suffering from chronic pain with significant savings, and we look forward to bringing this drug onto the market as soon as possible”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Alvotech has developed a biosimilar (analogous to a generic) of Humira called AVT02, the first-filed biosimilar drug equal in strength to Humira’s latest formulation, which AbbVie markets as a high-concentration, pain-free drug. The company is also developing AVT02 as an interchangeable product and it expects results from its ongoing interchangeability study in Q2 of this year. AVT02 could save U.S. taxpayers and the overall healthcare system $8-10 billion annually.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Our new product will be a gamechanger that will provide consumers who are suffering from chronic pain with significant savings, and we look forward to bringing this drug onto the market as soon as possible,” said <b>Alvotech Founder and Chairman Robert Wessman</b>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As alleged in court today, AbbVie seeks to overwhelm Alvotech with 60+ patent claims of questionable validity in order to keep its closest competitor off the market, a tactic it has long used against other competitors. At stake are billions of dollars of cost to the U.S. healthcare system, which is largely driven by AbbVie’s significant price increases that its Humira monopoly makes possible. Later this month, AbbVie will <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Foversight.house.gov%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Fchairwoman-maloney-announces-oversight-committee-hearing-with-abbvie-ceo&amp;esheet=52427441&amp;newsitemid=20210511005833&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=face+questions+from+Congress&amp;index=1&amp;md5=94bf816e436bb19bafdb55bf15c2fcff"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" shape=""rect"">face questions from Congress</a> about whether the company improperly suppresses competition in order to maintain their monopoly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As alleged in the filing, AbbVie has taken several improper steps to inflate its patent portfolio, specifically:</p>

<ul class=""bwlistdisc"" style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>patenting purported inventions that it does not use in the production of Humira;</li>
 	<li>seeking multiple patents on the same invention but as part of different patent families in a manner designed to cause confusion;</li>
 	<li>obtaining patents through inequitable conduct;</li>
 	<li>by seeking patents that cover Humira already in the prior art; and</li>
 	<li>obtaining patents on purported inventions that AbbVie did not invent.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Today, affordable biosimilars to Humira are available across Europe and in Japan, Canada and Australia. The settlement agreements that allowed launches in 2018 of biosimilars in Europe were done to delay launches of similar products in the U.S., thus allowing AbbVie the ability to maintain and even increase prices on the U.S. consumer and taxpayer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As pointed out in Alvotech’s lawsuit, AbbVie did not invent adalimumab or the subject matter of the original patents surrounding adalimumab and its use, instead acquiring them from German BASF AG. Nevertheless, despite those original patents expiring in 2016, AbbVie has been able to extend its monopoly to 2023 and beyond by deliberately seeking to block legitimate competition.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 2010, AbbVie developed and tested a less-painful and higher-concentration version of Humira that was as a 100 mg/ml formulation, which the FDA approved in 2015. Yet the company waited nearly three years before bringing this new formulation to the public, a strategic move meant to entrench their control over the market and hobble the competition. Alvotech has developed and is seeking interchangeability for the less-painful, high-concentration version of Humira, which will offer patients the treatment at a more affordable price point.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Furthermore, AbbVie successfully sought and obtained over 100 additional patents of dubious validity that extended its Humira monopoly beyond 2016. Through settlements reached with their competitors, other biosimilars will not enter the market until 2023.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In just the last four years, since its monopoly should have run its course, AbbVie has reported selling over $75 billion worth of Humira and is forecasted to make an additional nearly $40 billion through 2022.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As alleged in today’s filing, this strategy has been called a “minefield of IP” by those in AbbVie’s leadership, meaning the company will engage in endless litigation not to protect innovation but to make challenges to its patent claims cost- and resource-prohibitive for competitors.</p>

<span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span> and SUZHOU, China, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 3, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high-quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/innovent-and-lilly-jointly-announce-the-china-nmpa-approval-of-tyvyt-sintilimab-injection-in-combination-with-gemcitabine-and-platinum-chemotherapy-as-first-line-therapy-for-people-with-squamous-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-301304894.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">LLY</a>) today jointly announced that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China has approved the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy as first-line therapy for people with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC).

This is the third NMPA-approved indication of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), following the approval in <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2018</span> for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the approval in <span class=""xn-chron"">February 2021</span> for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsqNSCLC). This is also the first regulatory approval of a PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment for people with sqNSCLC.

This new approval was based on a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical trial (ORIENT-12) which evaluated TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) or placebo in combination with GEMZAR® (gemcitabine) and platinum chemotherapy as first-line therapy for people with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC.

Professor Caicun Zhou, head of the Oncology Department at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, stated: ""Lung cancer is the leading cause (nearly 25%) of all cancer deaths, of which non-small cell lung cancer accounts for about 80 to 85 percent. Approximately 70 percent of patients with non-small cell lung cancer have unresectable tumors at the time of diagnosis, and 30 to 60 percent of patients with Stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer who undergo radical surgery subsequently have recurrence or distant metastasis. Over the past two decades, drug development for non-small cell lung cancer has been mainly focused on nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, while drug development for squamous non-small cell lung cancer has been relatively slow due to its unique epidemiology, histopathology and molecular biology. The ORIENT-12 study showed that, in the first-line treatment of patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer, TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to placebo and gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy. Meanwhile, although the median overall survival data was not yet mature, the TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) combination arm showed a potential overall survival benefit over chemotherapy alone. The approval of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) provides a new clinical approach in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> for the first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We look forward to offering this new indication of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) and helping to treat people with squamous non-small cell lung cancer in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.""

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Yongjun Liu</span>, President of Innovent, stated: ""As one of the most life-threatening diseases, cancer has always been a key focus for the pharmaceutical companies, researchers and clinicians that help develop oncology treatments. Innovent is committed to discovering and developing innovative medicines for diseases with unmet medical needs. This approval of TVYYT® (sintilimab injection) in a third indication represents another remarkable achievement for our novel, high quality PD-1 inhibitor in cancer treatment. We are very excited about this approval, and we look forward to now offering this as a first-line treatment option for people with squamous non-small cell lung cancer.""

Dr. Hui ZHOU, Senior Vice President of Clinical Development of Innovent, stated: ""In China, lung cancer has the highest incidence and mortality rate among all tumor types. Although treatment development has been advancing in recent years, there is still a large number of people with lung cancer that lack effective treatment options – particularly those with the squamous type. This new indication of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) provides an additional first-line treatment option for people with squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We are hopeful that TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) will help many people with this type of cancer.""

<span class=""xn-person"">Julio Gay</span>-ger, <span class=""xn-person"">Lilly China President</span> and General Manager, stated: ""Oncology is one of the most important strategic therapeutic areas for Lilly. In particular, we have been deeply rooted in lung cancer treatment for many years. We're excited to see two new indications for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with two Lilly classic anti-tumor drugs – pemetrexed and gemcitabine, respectively – and platinum chemotherapy as first-line therapy for people with non-small cell lung cancer, both approved this year by the NMPA within a few months of each other. We are committed to the development and commercialization of effective cancer therapies and devote ourselves to helping patients with more innovative products through independent R&amp;D and strategic collaborations.""

Dr. Li WANG, Senior Vice President of <span class=""xn-person"">Lilly China</span> and Head of Lilly China Drug Development and Medical Affairs Center, stated: ""Results of multiple clinical studies show that immuno-oncology therapy has become one of the standard global treatment options for lung cancer due to its proven clinical efficacy and safety. The approval of this new indication has further demonstrated its potential to treat people with lung cancer. Lilly will continue to work closely with Innovent to further explore TYVYT's clinical potential in other tumor types with the hopes of helping more cancer patients.""

<b>About Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</b>

Lung cancer is a malignancy with the highest morbidity and mortality in China. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 80 to 85 percent of lung cancer. Approximately 70 percent of people with NSCLC have locally advanced or metastatic disease at initial diagnosis, rendering many of those patients with no chance of radical resection. Meanwhile, even after radical surgery, patients still have a high chance of recurrence and eventually die from disease progression. About 30 percent of people in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> with NSCLC have tumors of the squamous subtype and there are limited approved second-line therapies for these patients. Therefore, this remains a huge unmet medical need in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.

<b>About ORIENT-12</b>

ORIENT-12 (ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03629925"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03629925</a>)is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) or placebo in combination with GEMZAR® (gemcitabine) and platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) as a first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC). A total of 357 participants were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio (179 participants in the TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) combination arm, 178 participants in the placebo combination arm).

ORIENT-12 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), the study's primary endpoint, of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with GEMZAR® and platinum chemotherapy compared with placebo in combination with GEMZAR® and platinum chemotherapy. The median PFS of the TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) combination arm was 5.5 months compared to 4.9 months on the placebo combination arm (HR=0.536, 95% CI: 0.422-0.681, P&lt; 0.00001) as assessed by Independent Radiographic Review Committee (IRRC), and 6.7 months compared to 4.9 months respectively (HR=0.532, 95% CI: 0.419-0.674, P&lt; 0.00001), as assessed by the study's investigators. Overall survival (OS), a secondary endpoint, of the TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) combination arm showed a positive trend when compared to the placebo combination arm (HR=0.567, 95%CI: 0.353-0.909, P=0.01701), though the data were not yet mature at an interim analysis. The safety profile is consistent with previously reported TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) studies, and no new safety signals were identified.

<b>About Sintilimab</b>

Sintilimab, marketed as TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, is an innovative PD-1 inhibitor with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Lilly. Sintilimab is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1 / PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies of sintilimab to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials.

In China, sintilimab has been approved for three indications, including:
<ul>
 	<li>The treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy</li>
 	<li>In combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
 	<li>In combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
</ul>
Additionally, Innovent currently has regulatory submissions under review in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> for sintilimab:
<ul>
 	<li>In combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab injection) for the first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma</li>
 	<li>The second-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
</ul>
In <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2021</span>, the U.S. FDA accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Sintilimab was included in China's National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in 2019 as the first PD-1 inhibitor and the only PD-1 included in the list in that year.

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced first-time results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-564 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, for the potential adjuvant treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence following nephrectomy (surgical removal of a kidney) or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions. After a median follow-up of 24.1 months (14.9-41.5), KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death by 32% compared to placebo (HR=0.68 [95% CI, 0.53–0.87]; p=0.0010). Additionally, a favorable trend in overall survival (OS) was observed with a 46% reduction in the risk of death with KEYTRUDA as compared to placebo (HR=0.54 [95% CI, 0.30–0.96]; p=0.0164). As previously <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmercks-keytruda-pembrolizumab-demonstrated-superior-disease-free-survival-dfs-compared-with-placebo-as-adjuvant-therapy-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma-rcc-following-surgery%2F&amp;esheet=52440174&amp;newsitemid=20210603006033&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=1&amp;md5=27ff0d6a12de1b16e6e2d2c669a1bf6f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">announced</a>, the trial will continue to evaluate OS, a key secondary endpoint.

“With the results of KEYNOTE-564, pembrolizumab is the first immunotherapy to show a clinical benefit in the adjuvant setting in kidney cancer,” said Dr. Toni K. Choueiri, director of the Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “It took several decades to achieve this milestone. We hope to build on this important research and provide new treatment options to kidney cancer patients.”

“As nearly half of early-stage renal cell carcinoma patients experience disease recurrence after surgery, we are particularly encouraged to see that KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the risk of recurrence or death by 32% compared with placebo in this study,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “These data highlight the opportunity for KEYTRUDA to become a new standard of care for patients with early-stage renal cell carcinoma and we look forward to working closely with regulatory authorities to make this treatment option available to patients.”

The late-breaking results will be presented in the Plenary session of the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (Abstract #LBA5) on Sunday, June 6, 2021. As <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-highlights-scientific-data-at-2021-asco-annual-meeting-across-more-than-20-cancer-types-from-broad-oncology-research-program%2F&amp;esheet=52440174&amp;newsitemid=20210603006033&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=2&amp;md5=e9042101efea7faedc4053bffb9dd3c5"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">announced</a>, data spanning more than 20 types of cancer will be presented from Merck’s oncology research program at ASCO.

Merck is continuing to study KEYTRUDA, in combination or as monotherapy, as well as other investigational products across multiple settings and stages of RCC including adjuvant and advanced or metastatic disease through our broad clinical development program, which includes over 20 clinical studies and more than 4,000 patients.

KEYTRUDA is currently approved in the U.S., Europe and Japan in combination with axitinib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC.

<b>Study Design and Additional Data from KEYNOTE-564</b>

KEYNOTE-564 is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 trial (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2F&amp;esheet=52440174&amp;newsitemid=20210603006033&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=ClinicalTrials.gov&amp;index=4&amp;md5=6b2920fdc46a9111485205c817116a82"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03142334&amp;esheet=52440174&amp;newsitemid=20210603006033&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT03142334&amp;index=5&amp;md5=88dde16f2207938857ff65cd55bdbc79"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03142334</a>) evaluating KEYTRUDA<strong> </strong>monotherapy versus placebo for the adjuvant treatment of patients with RCC who have undergone nephrectomy and who have intermediate-high risk, high risk, or M1 no evidence of disease (M1 NED) RCC with clear cell component. The study enrolled 994 patients who were randomized to receive either KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to 17 cycles) or placebo (saline solution IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to 17 cycles). The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary endpoints include OS and safety.

As of data cutoff (Dec. 14, 2020), the median study follow-up was 24.1 months. Findings showed KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in DFS in patients with RCC<i> </i>following nephrectomy or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions compared with placebo (HR=0.68 [95% CI, 0.53–0.87]; p=0.0010). Additionally, the two-year estimated DFS rate was 77.3% with KEYTRUDA versus 68.1% with placebo. Overall, the DFS benefit was consistent across subgroups. Median DFS was not achieved in either treatment arm based on event accrual.

Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 18.9% of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm and 1.2% of patients in the placebo arm. TRAEs resulting in discontinuation of any treatment occurred in 17.6% of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm and 0.6% of patients in the placebo arm. The most common TRAEs of any grade (occurring in =5% of patients) were fatigue (20.3%), pruritus (18.6%) and hypothyroidism (17.6%) in the KEYTRUDA arm and fatigue (14.3%), pruritus (11.5%) and diarrhea (10.3%) in the placebo arm. The most common immune-mediated adverse events of any grade (occurring in =3% of patients) were hypothyroidism (21.1%) and hyperthyroidism (11.9%) in the KEYTRUDA arm and hypothyroidism (3.6%) in the placebo arm. No treatment-related deaths occurred.

<b>About Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)</b>

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancers are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men as in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. Worldwide, it is estimated there were nearly 431,300 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and almost 179,400 deaths from the disease in 2020. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated there will be nearly 76,100 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and almost 13,800 deaths from the disease in 2021.

<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong>

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,400 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% of these patients interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.

<span class=""bwuline"">Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</span>

<i>KEYTRUDA</i> <i>as a Single Agent</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.

<i>KEYTRUDA with Axitinib</i>

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen, which was at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT =3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT =3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT =3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</span>

<i>Adrenal Insufficiency</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.

<i>Hypophysitis</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.

<i>Thyroid Disorders</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.

Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism.

<i>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic Ketoacidosis</i>

Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1). All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal Dysfunction</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.

<span class=""bwuline"">Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</span>

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. <i>Cardiac/Vascular:</i> Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; <i>Nervous System:</i> Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; <i>Ocular:</i> Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; <i>Gastrointestinal:</i> Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; <i>Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue:</i> Myositis/polymyositis rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; <i>Endocrine:</i> Hypoparathyroidism; <i>Hematologic/Immune:</i> Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.

<span class=""xn-location"">SILVER SPRING, Md.</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 3, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- United Therapeutics Corporation (Nasdaq: UTHR) announced today that the first patient has enrolled in the phase 3 <i>TETON</i> study, which is expected to evaluate approximately 396 adult patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (<b>IPF</b>). This 52-week study will evaluate the impact of Tyvaso on a key prognostic indicator for IPF known as forced vital capacity (<b>FVC</b>). IPF is a progressive lung disease characterized by the loss of the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen, ultimately resulting in respiratory failure and death. IPF is estimated to affect 100,000 people in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>.

""Despite the availability of two approved products in the therapeutic category, there remains a critical unmet need in IPF,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Steven Nathan</span>, M.D., the Medical Director of the Advanced Lung Disease and Lung Transplant Program at Inova Fairfax Hospital in <span class=""xn-location"">Falls Church, Virginia</span>, who is also chair of the <i>TETON</i> trial steering committee. Dr. Nathan further added, ""We were pleasantly surprised to note the intriguing post-hoc analysis of safety data collected from the <i>INCREASE</i> study that showed a positive impact of inhaled treprostinil on FVC in IPF patients with pulmonary hypertension. In follow-up to this, the <i>TETON</i> study has been designed to validate the potential antifibrotic effects of inhaled treprostinil in IPF patients.""

Tyvaso is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (<b>FDA</b>) to treat both pulmonary arterial hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension (<b>PH</b>) associated with interstitial lung disease (<b>PH-ILD</b>). The PH-ILD indication, which includes patients with PH associated with IPF, was added to the Tyvaso label in <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2021</span> based on the successful results of the <i>INCREASE </i>study. Tyvaso is not approved for use for IPF patients without documented PH.

""The initiation of the <i>TETON </i>study is an important milestone in potentially bringing an improved treatment option to patients with IPF,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Leigh Peterson</span>, Ph.D., United Therapeutics' Senior Vice President of Global Product Development. ""The <i>TETON</i> study is an example of our company's flexible development model to expand beyond PH and will help us to better understand the impact of treprostinil in mitigating the FVC decline seen in IPF patients.""

The FDA has granted Tyvaso orphan drug designation for the treatment of IPF. As a result, if the FDA updates Tyvaso's labeling to include an IPF indication following a successful <i>TETON </i>study, the FDA should confer seven years of market exclusivity in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> following marketing approval by FDA.

<b>About <i>TETON<br class=""dnr"" /></i></b>The <i>TETON</i> study is a 396-patient, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 registration study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled treprostinil in subjects with IPF over a 52-week period.

Subjects will be randomly allocated 1:1 to receive inhaled treprostinil or placebo. All subjects will initiate inhaled treprostinil or placebo at a dose of three breaths administered four times daily (<b>QID</b>) and will titrate to a target dosing regimen of 12 breaths QID. Study drug doses may be titrated up as tolerated, until the target dose or maximum clinically tolerated dose is achieved.

The primary endpoint of the study is the change in FVC from baseline to week 52. Secondary endpoints include: (1) time to clinical worsening; (2) time to first acute exacerbation of IPF; (3) overall survival at week 52; (4) change in percent predicted FVC from baseline to week 52; and (5) change in the King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire.

Other data collected in the study will include the plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (<b>NT-proBNP</b>) concentration, supplemental oxygen use, and lung diffusion capacity. Safety assessments include the development of adverse events, serious adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and electrocardiogram parameters.

<b>About IPF<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (<b>IPF</b>) is a scarring disease of the lungs of an unknown (idiopathic) cause and is the most common of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. IPF is characterized by the progressive loss of the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen, ultimately resulting in respiratory failure and death. While the precise causes of IPF remain unknown, IPF rarely presents before age 50 and can be associated with cigarette smoking and certain genetic dispositions. In addition, some evidence suggests that gastroesophageal reflux (acid reflux, or heartburn), certain viral infections, air pollution, and some exposures in the workplace may be risk factors for IPF. IPF is estimated to affect approximately 100,000 patients in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> and the median survival of patients with IPF ranges from 2 to 3 years.

<b>About TYVASO<sup>®</sup> (treprostinil) Inhalation Solution</b>

INDICATION

TYVASO (treprostinil) is a prostacyclin mimetic indicated for the treatment of:
<ul>
 	<li>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing effectiveness predominately included patients with NYHA Functional Class III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (56%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (33%).<br class=""dnr"" /> <br class=""dnr"" />The effects diminish over the minimum recommended dosing interval of 4 hours; treatment timing can be adjusted for planned activities.<br class=""dnr"" /> <br class=""dnr"" />While there are long-term data on use of treprostinil by other routes of administration, nearly all controlled clinical experience with inhaled treprostinil has been on a background of bosentan (an endothelin receptor antagonist) or sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor). The controlled clinical experience was limited to 12 weeks in duration.<br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li>Pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD; WHO Group 3) to improve exercise ability. The study establishing effectiveness predominately included patients with etiologies of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) (45%) inclusive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) (25%), and WHO Group 3 connective tissue disease (22%).</li>
</ul>
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
<ul>
 	<li>TYVASO is a pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. In patients with low systemic arterial pressure, TYVASO may produce symptomatic hypotension.</li>
 	<li>TYVASO inhibits platelet aggregation and increases the risk of bleeding.</li>
 	<li>Co-administration of a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor (e.g., gemfibrozil) may increase exposure (both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of a CYP2C8 enzyme inducer (e.g., rifampin) may decrease exposure to treprostinil. Increased exposure is likely to increase adverse events associated with treprostinil administration, whereas decreased exposure is likely to reduce clinical effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
DRUG INTERACTIONS/SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
<ul>
 	<li>The concomitant use of TYVASO with diuretics, antihypertensives, or other vasodilators may increase the risk of symptomatic hypotension.</li>
 	<li>Human pharmacokinetic studies with an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diolamine) indicated that co-administration of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor, gemfibrozil, increases exposure (both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer, rifampin, decreases exposure to treprostinil. It is unclear if the safety and efficacy of treprostinil by the inhalation route are altered by inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8.</li>
 	<li>Limited case reports of treprostinil use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. However, pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal mortality. There are no data on the presence of treprostinil in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.</li>
 	<li>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</li>
 	<li>Across clinical studies used to establish the effectiveness of TYVASO in patients with PAH and PH–ILD, 268 (47.8%) patients aged 65 years and over were enrolled. The treatment effects and safety profile observed in geriatric patients were similar to younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of hepatic, renal, or cardiac dysfunction, and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.</li>
</ul>
ADVERSE REACTIONS
<ul>
 	<li><u>Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (WHO Group 1)<br class=""dnr"" /></u>In a 12-week, placebo-controlled study (TRIUMPH I) of 235 patients with PAH (WHO Group 1 and nearly all NYHA Functional Class III), the most common adverse reactions seen with TYVASO in =4% of PAH patients and more than 3% greater than placebo in the placebo-controlled study were cough (54% vs 29%), headache (41% vs 23%), throat irritation/pharyngolaryngeal pain (25% vs 14%), nausea (19% vs 11%), flushing (15% vs &lt;1%), and syncope (6% vs &lt;1%). In addition, adverse reactions occurring in =4% of patients were dizziness and diarrhea.<br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li><u>Pulmonary Hypertension Associated with ILD (WHO Group 3)<br class=""dnr"" /></u>In a 16-week, placebo-controlled study (INCREASE) of 326 patients with PH-ILD (WHO Group 3), adverse reactions were similar to the experience in studies of PAH.</li>

For the combination of <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy, median OS was 15.4 months vs. 9.1 months for chemotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1, a primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 99.5% CI: 0.37-0.80, p&lt;0.0001), and 13.2 months vs. 10.7 months in the all-randomized patient population, a secondary endpoint (HR 0.74, 99.1% CI: 0.58-0.96, p=0.0021). A statistically significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was also observed with <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1, with a median PFS by blinded independent central review (BICR) of 6.9 months compared to 4.4 months with chemotherapy alone (HR 0.65, 98.5% CI: 0.46-0.92, p=0.0023).

For the combination of <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i>, median OS was 13.7 months vs. 9.1 months for chemotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1, a primary endpoint (HR 0.64, 98.6% CI: 0.46-0.90, p=0.001), and 12.8 months vs. 10.7 months, respectively, in the all-randomized patient population, a secondary endpoint (HR 0.78, 98.2% CI: 0.62-0.98, p=0.011). <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> did not meet its other primary endpoint of PFS by BICR in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (4.0 months vs. 4.4 months; HR 1.02, 98.5% CI: 0.73-1.43, p=0.8958).

The safety profiles of <i>Opdivo </i>plus chemotherapy and <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> were consistent with those previously reported for other tumor types. Grade 3/4 drug-related adverse events were 47% in the <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy arm, 32% in the <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> arm, and 36% in the chemotherapy arm. The safety profile in patients with PD-L1 =1% was consistent with the all-randomized data.

“Patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma face a median survival of around 10 months when treated with chemotherapy alone and there is a clear need for treatment options beyond this current standard of care,” said Ian Chau, M.D., Consultant Medical Oncologist, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. “The data being presented at ASCO show that both of these nivolumab-based treatment options resulted in significant improvements in survival over chemotherapy and could offer potential new treatment options.”

The median duration of response (DoR) per BICR was 8.4 months for <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy, 11.8 months for <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i>, and 5.7 months for chemotherapy alone in patients whose tumors express PD-L1, and 8.2 months, 11.1, and 7.1 months, respectively, in the all-randomized population.

<i>Opdivo </i>plus chemotherapy also showed a clinically meaningful increase in objective response rate (ORR). The ORR per BICR was 53% for <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy, 35% for <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i>, and 20% for chemotherapy alone in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 and 47%, 28% and 27%, respectively, in the all-randomized population.

CheckMate –648 is the first global Phase 3 study to evaluate both an immunotherapy and chemotherapy combination as well as a dual immunotherapy combination in advanced ESCC.

“These data add to our growing body of evidence supporting the clinical benefit of <i>Opdivo</i> in upper GI cancers, from the late-line metastatic setting to earlier stages of disease,” said Ian M. Waxman, M.D., development lead, gastrointestinal cancers, Bristol Myers Squibb. “<i>Opdivo</i> has now demonstrated superior first-line efficacy in multiple upper GI cancers across histologies and tumor locations.”

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CheckMate -648</span></b>

CheckMate -648 is a randomized Phase 3 study evaluating <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy </i>or <i>Opdivo</i> plus fluorouracil and cisplatin against fluorouracil plus cisplatin alone in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

The primary endpoints of the trial are overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 =1% for both <i>Opdivo</i>-based combinations versus chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints of the trial include OS and PFS by BICR in the all-randomized population.

In the <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy arm (N=321), patients received treatment with <i>Opdivo</i> 240 mg on Day 1 and Day 15, fluorouracil 800 mg/m²/day on Day 1 through Day 5 (for 5 days), and cisplatin 80 mg/m² on Day 1 of four-week cycle. Patients received <i>Opdivo</i> for up to 24 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, and chemotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

In the <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> arm (N=325), patients received treatment with <i>Opdivo</i> 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and <i>Yervoy</i> 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks up to 24 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Esophageal Cancer</span></b>

Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of death from cancer worldwide, with approximately 604,000 new cases and over 544,000 deaths in 2020. The two most common types of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma, which account for approximately 90% and 10% of all esophageal cancers, respectively, though esophageal tumor histology can vary by region. The overall burden of ESCC is concentrated in Asia, where roughly 80% of the global cases occurred in 2020. The majority of esophageal cancer cases are diagnosed in the advanced setting and impact a patient’s daily life, including their ability to eat and drink. ESCC occurs most often in the upper and middle portions of the esophagus, whereas adenocarcinoma begins in the cells of mucus-secreting glands in the esophagus and most often occurs in the lower portion of the esophagus.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Opdivo</i></span></b>

<i>Opdivo</i> is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, <i>Opdivo</i> has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.

<i>Opdivo</i>’s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the <i>Opdivo</i> clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The <i>Opdivo</i> trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from <i>Opdivo</i> across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.

In July 2014, <i>Opdivo</i> was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. <i>Opdivo</i> is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Yervoy </i>combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Yervoy</i></span></b>

<i>Yervoy</i> is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. <i>Yervoy</i> binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <i>Yervoy</i> 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. <i>Yervoy</i> is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for <i>Yervoy</i> spanning multiple tumor types.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

Some ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada–like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 4",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bristol-Myers-Squibb-1.jpg,Clinical Trials,BMS,Opdivo|nivolumab|Yervoy|ipilimumab,ESCC|Clinical Trials|Advanced|Metastatic|ASCO 2021|CheckMate -648 Trial|CT|P-III|Unresectable,publish,04-06-2021,2

LONG BEACH, Calif. &amp; BASEL, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dermavant Sciences, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics in immuno-dermatology, today announced that it has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for tapinarof for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Tapinarof is a novel, therapeutic aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulating agent, in development as a once-daily, steroid-free and cosmetically elegant topical cream for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. The FDA has a 60-day review period to determine whether the NDA is complete and acceptable for filing. The company submitted the NDA to the FDA on May 26, 2021.

“Psoriasis impacts approximately 8 million Americans, who have to navigate the physical and emotional toll from this devastating disease,” said Todd Zavodnick, Chief Executive Officer of Dermavant. “Today’s NDA submission marks a significant milestone as we work toward FDA approval of tapinarof for adults with plaque psoriasis and their dermatologists who are looking to fill current treatment gaps. We plan on continuing our commercial preparations to bring this novel product candidate to the U.S. market as expeditiously as possible, subject to regulatory approval.”

Today’s submission is supported by positive Phase 3 data from <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermavant.com%2Fdermavant-reports-positive-phase-3-results-for-tapinarof-cream-in-adult-patients-with-plaque-psoriasis%2F&amp;esheet=52438350&amp;newsitemid=20210603005263&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=PSOARING+1+and+PSOARING+2&amp;index=1&amp;md5=5427ea96e0fa979a486a357121e1d9f2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2</a>, two replicate, multi-center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind studies, as well as the interim results from <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermavant.com%2Fpositive-data-from-psoaring-3-support-long-term-use-of-tapinarof-cream-in-adults-with-plaque-psoriasis-with-durable-on-therapy-and-remittive-off-therapy-benefits%2F&amp;esheet=52438350&amp;newsitemid=20210603005263&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=PSOARING+3&amp;index=2&amp;md5=e501de35aa6f84448bb8ca71037646e6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">PSOARING 3</a>, a 40-week, open-label safety study. In these studies, treatment with tapinarof cream led to statistically significant improvement relative to vehicle in Physician Global Assessment (PGA) scores of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with a minimum 2-grade improvement from baseline at week 12, with statistically significant improvement in all secondary endpoints at week 12. Approximately 40% of patients achieved complete disease clearance with continued therapy beyond 12 weeks. In addition, a remittive benefit of approximately four months was observed following treatment discontinuation.

<b>About Dermavant’s Phase 3 Program for Tapinarof in Psoriasis</b>

Dermavant’s pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for tapinarof in adult plaque psoriasis consists of PSOARING 1 (NCT03956355) and PSOARING 2 (NCT03983980), as well as PSOARING 3 (NCT04053387), the ongoing long-term safety study.

PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2, which collectively enrolled 1,025 patients, were two identically designed, multi-center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, parallel group studies conducted in North America that evaluated the safety and efficacy of tapinarof cream, 1% dosed once daily (QD) for 12 weeks versus vehicle QD in adult patients aged 18-75 years diagnosed with plaque psoriasis. The primary endpoint of both studies was the proportion of patients who achieved a PGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with a minimum 2-grade improvement from baseline at Week 12.

PSOARING 3 is a long-term, open-label, extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tapinarof cream, 1% for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. Subjects in the study had previously completed treatment with tapinarof or vehicle in either the PSOARING 1 or PSOARING 2 Phase 3 pivotal efficacy and safety studies. PSOARING 3 consists of up to 40 weeks of tapinarof cream, 1%, and a 4-week safety follow-up period. As such, subjects who received drug during PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 completed PSOARING 3, having received treatment with tapinarof cream for up to 52 weeks. Greater than 90% of eligible patients who completed PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 enrolled in PSOARING 3. Dermavant released interim analysis results from PSOARING 3 in February 2021.

<b>About Psoriasis</b>

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by red patches and plaques with silvery scales on the skin. Psoriasis affects approximately 8 million people in the United States and 125 million worldwide.

Psoriasis can begin at any age, but typically has two peaks of onset, the first at age 20 to 30 years and the second at age 50 to 60 years. People with psoriasis are at an increased risk of developing other chronic and serious health conditions. Comorbidities include psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and depression. Psoriasis has a significant impact on quality of life and on psychological health.

<p align=""justify"">CHATHAM, N.J., June 03, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: TNXP) (Tonix or the Company), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced the poster presentation of positive results from its Phase 3 clinical study, RELIEF, of TNX-102 SL for the management of fibromyalgia. A copy of the poster will be made available under the IR Events tab of the Investors section of the Tonix website at www.tonixpharma.com.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The poster, titled, “<em>Efficacy and Safety of TNX-102 SL (Sublingual Cyclobenzaprine) for the Treatment of Fibromyalgia in the RELIEF Study: Positive Results of a Phase 3 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Multicenter Trial”</em> shows that TNX-102 SL met its pre-specified primary endpoint in the Phase 3 RELIEF trial, significantly reducing daily pain compared to placebo (p=0.01) and was associated with a higher rate than placebo of =30% pain responders in participants with fibromyalgia (p=0.006). TNX-102 SL at 5.6 mg also showed activity in key secondary endpoints measuring improvements in sleep quality, mitigation of fatigue, and fibromyalgia-specific functional recovery. In addition, TNX-102 SL was well tolerated and was not associated with side-effects seen with other approved oral fibromyalgia treatments, including weight gain, insomnia, nausea or sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We believe the results of the Phase 3 RELIEF trial validate the mechanism that improved sleep quality can lead to syndromal effects on fibromyalgia, improving not only pain but also sleep and fatigue. The sublingual formulation of TNX-102 SL for transmucosal absorption showed promise at the 2.8 mg dose in prior fibromyalgia studies, but we believe RELIEF provides evidence that 5.6 mg is the right dose for this patient population,” said Seth Lederman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “We expect interim analysis results for the confirmatory Phase 3 study, RALLY, in the third quarter of this year, followed by topline data in the first quarter of next year.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Fibromyalgia</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that is understood to result from amplified sensory and pain signaling within the central nervous system. Fibromyalgia afflicts an estimated 6-12 million adults in the U.S., approximately 90% of whom are women. Symptoms of fibromyalgia include chronic widespread pain, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, and morning stiffness. Other associated symptoms include cognitive dysfunction and mood disturbances, including anxiety and depression. Individuals suffering from fibromyalgia struggle with their daily activities, have impaired quality of life, and frequently are disabled. Physicians and patients report common dissatisfaction with currently marketed products.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About TNX-102 SL</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">TNX-102 SL is a patented sublingual tablet formulation of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride which provides rapid transmucosal absorption and reduced production of a long half-life active metabolite, norcyclobenzaprine, due to bypass of first-pass hepatic metabolism. As a multifunctional agent with potent binding and antagonist activities at the serotonin<sub>2A</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic, histaminergic-H<sub>1</sub>, and muscarinic-M<sub>1</sub> receptors, TNX-102 SL is in clinical development as a daily bedtime treatment for fibromyalgia, PTSD, alcohol use disorder and agitation in Alzheimer’s disease. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued United States Patent No. 9636408 in May 2017, Patent No. 9956188 in May 2018, Patent No. 10117936 in November 2018, Patent No. 10,357,465 in July 2019, and Patent No. 10736859 in August 2020. The Protectic™ protective eutectic and Angstro-Technology™ formulation claimed in these patents are important elements of Tonix’s proprietary TNX-102 SL composition. These patents are expected to provide TNX-102 SL, upon NDA approval, with U.S. market exclusivity until 2034/2035.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Phase 3 RELIEF Study</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The RELIEF study has been completed and TNX-102 SL achieved a statistically significant benefit as measured by the primary, prespecified endpoint of improvement over placebo in daily pain. The RELIEF study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) for the management of fibromyalgia. The two-arm trial targeted enrollment of 470 participants, at approximately 40 U.S. sites. RELIEF completed final enrollment of 503 participants. The first two weeks of treatment were a run-in period in which participants start on TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg (1 tablet) or placebo. After the first two weeks, all participants had the dose increased to TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) or two placebo tablets for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was daily diary pain severity score change (TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg vs. placebo) from baseline (using the weekly averages of the daily numerical rating scale scores), analyzed by mixed model repeated measures with multiple imputation.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Additional details about the completed RELIEF study are available at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04172831), and study results are detailed in the poster presentation at ASCP (available under the IR Events tab of the Investors section of the Tonix website at www.tonixpharma.com).</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Phase 3 RALLY Study</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The ongoing RALLY study is also a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets). The trial design and endpoints are essentially the same as the RELIEF study; however, the RALLY study is targeting to enroll 200 more participants than the RELIEF study, for a total of 670 participants at approximately 40 U.S. sites. RALLY has already enrolled more than 335 participants for the interim cohort. RALLY will have a planned interim analysis based on the first approximately 335 recruited participants in which an independent data monitoring board (IDMB) will make recommendations to the company to stop early for success, continue as planned, add more participants, or stop for futility. The interim analysis results expected in the third quarter of 2021 followed by topline data in the first quarter of 2022.</p>

<strong>Basel, </strong><strong>June </strong><strong>0</strong><strong>6</strong><strong>, 20</strong><strong>2</strong><strong>1</strong> — Novartis today announced Phase II primary endpoint data showing investigational iptacopan (LNP023) – a first-in-class, oral, targeted factor B inhibitor – reduced protein in the urine (proteinuria), an increasingly recognized surrogate marker correlating with progression to kidney failure<sup>2</sup>, and showed promise in stabilizing kidney function in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN)<sup>1</sup>. The data were presented at the 58<sup>th</sup> ERA-EDTA Congress held virtually from June 5–8, 2021.

In the Phase II study (NCT03373461), patients (n=112) with IgAN were randomized to placebo or different doses of iptacopan<sup>1</sup>. The primary endpoint was met with a statistically significant (p=0.038) dose response effect on reduction in proteinuria (as measured by 24-hour urinary protein to creatine ratio [UPCR 24h]) with iptacopan vs. placebo, at 90 days<sup>1</sup>. At the highest dose of 200mg twice daily a 23% reduction in proteinuria was predicted, compared with placebo, at 90 days<sup>1</sup>.

“IgAN is a devastating disease with no currently approved treatments. These efficacy data, seen after 90 days of treatment, along with the safety profile, offer hope that inhibition of the alternative complement pathway with iptacopan may be an effective way to delay IgAN disease progression,” said study lead author Jonathan Barratt, Professor of Renal Medicine, University of Leicester and nephrology consultant, Leicester General Hospital. “These data highlight the ability of iptacopan to address one of the key drivers for this disease and its potential to provide a much-needed, targeted treatment for people living with IgAN.”

Iptacopan also demonstrated a trend towards stabilizing kidney function, as assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<sup>1</sup>: a key measure of kidney clearance function that estimates the rate of blood passing through and being filtered by the kidneys<sup>8</sup>. Additionally, iptacopan showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile<sup>1</sup>.

“Complement-driven renal diseases, such as IgAN, are devastating and mostly affect young adults, imposing a high disease burden. These new data in IgAN add to the growing body of evidence around the potential of iptacopan to target a key driver in these rare renal diseases,” said John Tsai, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer at Novartis. “Conscious of the significant patient need for disease-modifying treatment options, we are rapidly advancing clinical development of iptacopan with the Phase III IgAN trial APPLAUSE already underway.”

Iptacopan is the most advanced asset in the company’s nephrology pipeline and targets the alternative complement pathway, a key driver of complement-driven renal diseases (CDRDs). New data from an interim analysis of a Phase II study of iptacopan in C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) – another CDRD – will also be presented at the congress on Monday 07 June 2021 at 12:30 p.m. CEST<sup>9</sup>. Novartis has plans to initiate additional Phase III studies in other renal indications.

Iptacopan is also in development for a life-threatening blood disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Based on disease prevalence and positive data from Phase II studies, iptacopan has received EMA orphan drug designation in IgAN<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>, orphan drug designations from the FDA and EMA in C3G and PNH<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>, FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation in PNH<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>, and EMA PRIME designation for C3G<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>.

<strong>About the studies
</strong>
NCT03373461 is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel-group adaptive design study to investigate the efficacy and safety of iptacopan in primary IgAN<sup>1</sup>. It is the first study to report the efficacy and safety of selective inhibition of the alternative complement pathway in IgAN<sup>1</sup>. The primary endpoint, and the primary aim of the interim analysis presented at the 2021 ERA-EDTA Congress, was to evaluate the dose response effect of iptacopan versus placebo on the reduction in urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR 24h) at 90 days of treatment<sup>1</sup>. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability of iptacopan, eGFR, and biomarkers reflecting activity of the alternative complement pathway<sup>1</sup>.

<strong>About iptacopan</strong>
Iptacopan is an investigational, first-in-class, orally administered factor B inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, targeting one of the key drivers of these diseases<sup>14-16</sup>. It has the potential to become the first targeted therapy to delay progression to dialysis in IgAN. Discovered at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, iptacopan is currently in development for a number of CDRDs where significant unmet needs exist, including IgAN, C3G, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and membranous nephropathy (MN), as well as the blood disorder PNH.

While Novartis has a 35-year history in kidney transplantation treatments, iptacopan is the first treatment in the nephrology pipeline addressing CDRDs. Our aim is to transform treatment by targeting one of the key drivers of these rare and often progressive diseases<sup>15</sup> and, in doing so, potentially extend dialysis-free life for people with CDRDs.

<strong>About</strong><strong> complement-driven renal diseases (CDRDs)</strong>
CDRDs, which include IgAN, are thought to be partly caused by an overactivation of the alternative complement pathway – part of the immune system – creating an inflammatory response, which can lead to kidney damage<sup>15</sup><sup>,17-</sup><sup>20</sup>. CDRDs mainly affect young adults, and can often lead to kidney failure which requires dialysis or transplantation and can lead to premature death<sup>3-7</sup>.

IgAN patients with persistent proteinuria levels of =1 g/day are at higher risk of disease progression, with about 30% progressing to kidney failure within 10 years<sup>21-23</sup>. Corticosteroids are often used to treat IgAN, as there are no approved treatment options. However, data on their efficacy have been inconsistent and this class of drugs has well-known side effects, which can be severe<sup>24-26</sup>.

There is a need for effective and well-tolerated, targeted therapies for IgAN that can delay disease progression.

<span class=""xn-location"">SILVER SPRING, Md.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 4, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ryplazim (plasminogen, human-tmvh) for the treatment of patients with plasminogen deficiency type 1, also referred to as hypoplasminogenemia, a disorder that can impair normal tissue and organ function and may lead to blindness.

""Until now, there were no FDA-approved treatment options for patients with plasminogen deficiency type 1,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Peter Marks</span>, M.D., Ph.D., director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. ""Today's approval helps address an unmet medical need for individuals affected by this rare genetic disease.""

Individuals with this disease lack a protein called plasminogen, which is responsible for the ability of the body to break down fibrin clots. Plasminogen deficiency leads to an accumulation of fibrin, causing the development of growths (lesions) that can impair normal tissue and organ function and may lead to blindness when these lesions affect the eyes.

The active ingredient in Ryplazim is plasminogen, purified from human plasma. Treatment with Ryplazim helps to increase the plasma level of plasminogen - enabling a temporary correction of the plasminogen deficiency and reduction or resolution of the lesions.

The effectiveness and safety of Ryplazim is primarily based on one single-arm, open-label (unblinded) clinical trial enrolling 15 adult and pediatric patients with plasminogen deficiency type 1. All patients received Ryplazim administered every two to four days for 48 weeks. The effectiveness of Ryplazim was demonstrated by at least 50% improvement of their lesions in all 11 patients who had lesions at baseline, and absence of recurrent or new lesions in any of the 15 patients through the 48 weeks of treatment.

The most common side effects reported by patients who received Ryplazim were abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, bleeding, limb pain, fatigue, constipation, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, joint pain, and back pain.

The FDA granted Ryplazim <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3186915-1&amp;h=3850489125&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Findustry%2Fdeveloping-products-rare-diseases-conditions%2Fdesignating-orphan-product-drugs-and-biological-products&amp;a=Orphan+Drug"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Orphan Drug</a> designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage drug development for rare diseases.

The FDA's rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program is intended to encourage development of new drugs and biologics to prevent and/or treat rare diseases in children.

Patients with plasminogen deficiency type 1 may bleed from active disease-related lesions. The use of Ryplazim may prolong or worsen active bleeding. Tissue sloughing (peeling/shedding) has also been observed. Because Ryplazim is derived from human plasma, it carries a risk of transmitting infectious agents. Based on effective donor screening procedures and product manufacturing processes, the risk of infectious disease transmission is remote.

The FDA granted approval to ProMetic Biotherapeutics Inc.

<strong>Bagsværd</strong><strong>, De</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>mark, </strong><strong>4</strong> <strong>June </strong><strong>2021</strong> – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Wegovy™ (the brand name for once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg injection in the US) for chronic weight management. Wegovy™ is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise for chronic weight management in adults with obesity (initial BMI=30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or overweight (initial BMI=27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with at least one weight-related comorbidity.

Wegovy™ is the first and only once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist   therapy approved for weight management for people living with obesity. The approval is based on the results from the STEP phase 3a clinical trial programme. Across the trials in people without type 2 diabetes, an average weight loss of 17-18%<sup>1</sup> sustained over 68 weeks was reported for people with obesity treated with Wegovy™. Wegovy™ demonstrated a safe and well-tolerated profile across the programme, with the most common adverse events being gastrointestinal.

“The approval of Wegovy™ in the US brings great promise to people with obesity. Despite the best efforts to lose weight, many people with obesity struggle to achieve and maintain weight loss due to physiological responses that favour weight regain,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president, Development at Novo Nordisk. “The unprecedented weight loss for an anti-obesity medication marks a new era in the treatment of obesity, and we now look forward to making Wegovy™ available to people living with obesity in the US”.

Novo Nordisk expects to launch Wegovy<sup>TM</sup> in the United States later in June 2021.

<strong>Conference call</strong>
On 7 June at 8.30 CEST, corresponding to 2.30 am EDT, a conference call for investors will be held. Investors will be able to listen in via a link on the investor section of novonordisk.com.

<strong>About</strong><strong> obesity</strong>
Obesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management. It is associated with many serious health complications and decreased life expectancy. Obesity-related complications are numerous and include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and certain types of cancer. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that obesity also increases the risk for severe illness and hospitalisation due to COVID-19.

The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems. Approximately 650 million adults are estimated to live with obesity worldwide.

<strong>About </strong><strong>Wegovy™</strong> (<strong>s</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>maglutide</strong><strong> 2.4 mg</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> and STEP</strong>
Semaglutide 2.4 mg is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, with 94% similarity to naturally occurring human GLP-1 hormone. It induces weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feeling of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. Once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg injection is approved for the treatment of adults with obesity or overweight in the US, in addition to diet and exercise.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management is currently under regulatory review in the EU and other countries. The submissions are based on the results from the STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity) phase 3 clinical development programme. The global clinical phase 3a programme consists of four trials and enrolled approximately 4,500 adults with overweight or obesity.

Final results from the head-to-head ELEVATE-RR Phase III trial of AstraZeneca’s <i>Calquence </i>(acalabrutinib) demonstrated non-inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and statistically significantly fewer events of atrial fibrillation versus ibrutinib in adults with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most common type of leukaemia in adults.<sup>1</sup>

Separately, updated results at four years of follow up from the ELEVATE-TN Phase III trial continued to show a strong PFS benefit for <i>Calquence</i> as combination therapy or as monotherapy in previously untreated patients with CLL.

At a median follow up of 40.9 months, the ELEVATE-RR trial met its primary endpoint of PFS non-inferiority versus ibrutinib with a median PFS of 38.4 months in both arms (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.27). Patients treated with <i>Calquence</i> had a statistically significantly lower incidence of all-grade atrial fibrillation compared with patients treated with ibrutinib (9.4% versus 16.0%), a key secondary endpoint.<sup>2</sup> Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rate that can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.<sup>3</sup>

John C. Byrd, MD, Distinguished University Professor, The Ohio State University, and lead investigator of the ELEVATE-RR trial, said: “Cardiac adverse events are an important consideration for treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients with Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors because they can produce significant morbidity in some cases<i> </i>and also lead patients to discontinue treatment. These data provide compelling evidence that acalabrutinib is a more tolerable option with reduced cardiovascular toxicity and overall fewer discontinuations due to adverse events, giving clinicians further reassurance when prescribing this medicine that patients can stay on treatment while maintaining ongoing control of their disease.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Tolerability is a critical factor in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who often remain on medicines for many years and experience multiple comorbidities. The totality of the <i>Calquence</i> data at ASCO confirm our confidence in the favourable benefit-risk profile of this medicine, with over 40 months of follow up in each of these two trials. Together, the results provide strong evidence that <i>Calquence</i> is a preferred option for people living with this chronic and devastating disease.”

The results of both trials were presented during the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting on 7 June 2021.

<b>ELEVATE-RR: <i>Calquence </i>versus ibrutinib in relapsed or refractory CLL
</b>ELEVATE-RR (ACE-CL-006) is the first Phase III trial to compare two Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors in patients with previously treated CLL with presence of 17p deletion or presence of 11q deletion.<sup>2 </sup>The trial met the non-inferiority endpoint for PFS defined by the trial for <i>Calquence </i>(n=268) versus ibrutinib (n=265) in patients with previously treated CLL with certain high-risk prognostic factors.<sup>2</sup>

Patients treated with <i>Calquence</i> had statistically significantly lower incidence of all-grade atrial fibrillation, a key secondary endpoint, compared with patients treated with ibrutinib (9.4% [n=25/266] versus 16.0% [n=42/263]; p=0.02).<sup>2</sup>

A lower frequency of adverse events (AEs) was observed with <i>Calquence</i> versus ibrutinib including lower common AEs, Grade 3 or higher AEs, serious AEs, treatment discontinuations due to AEs and overall cardiac events.<sup>2 </sup>The safety and tolerability of <i>Calquence</i> in ELEVATE-RR was consistent with the known profile of <i>Calquence.</i>

Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 14.7% of patients on <i>Calquence</i> and 21.3% of patients on ibrutinib. AEs of clinical interest for <i>Calquence</i> versus ibrutinib included cardiac events (all grade, 24.1%, and 30.0%, respectively), bleeding events (all grade, 38.0% and 51.3%, respectively), hypertension (all grade, 9.4% and 23.2%, respectively), infections (all grade, 78.2% and 81.4%, respectively), interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (all grade, 2.6% and 6.5%, respectively) and second primary malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (all-grade, 9.0% and 7.6%, respectively).<sup>2</sup> Serious AEs (any grade) occurred in 53.8% of patients on <i>Calquence</i> versus 58.6% of patients receiving ibrutinib.<sup>2</sup>

Median overall survival (OS) was not reached in either arm, with 63 (23.5%) patients in the <i>Calquence</i> arm, and 73 (27.5%) patients in the ibrutinib arm experiencing an event (HR of 0.82, 95% CI 0.59-1.15).<sup>2</sup>

<b>ELEVATE-TN: Four-year follow up for<i> Calquence </i>in previously untreated CLL
</b>ELEVATE-TN (ACE-CL-007) is a randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of <i>Calquence</i> in combination with obinutuzumab or alone versus chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab in previously untreated patients with CLL.<sup>4</sup> The trial met its primary endpoint (IRC-assessed PFS with <i>Calquence</i> plus obinutuzumab versus chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab) at the data cut-off for the interim analysis after a median follow up of 28.3 months.<sup>5</sup>

After a median follow up of 46.9 months, the ELEVATE-TN Phase III trial showed <i>Calquence</i> plus obinutuzumab reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 90% (HR 0.10, 95% CI 0.07-0.17) and as a monotherapy by 81% (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.13-0.28) compared with chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab.<sup>4</sup> Estimated PFS rates at 48 months for <i>Calquence</i> plus obinutuzumab or as monotherapy were 87% and 78%, respectively, versus 25% for chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab.<sup>4</sup> PFS findings were consistent across high-risk subgroups.<sup>4</sup> Median PFS was not yet reached for either <i>Calquence</i> arm at four years of follow up.<sup> </sup>Median OS was not reached in any treatment arm with a trend toward significance in the <i>Calquence</i> plus obinutuzumab group (p=0.0604).<sup>4</sup>

The safety profile remained largely unchanged from the interim analysis at 24 months, with similar treatment discontinuation rates across arms (25.1%, 30.7% and 22.6% for <i>Calquence</i> plus obinutuzumab, <i>Calquence</i> monotherapy and chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, respectively).<sup>4</sup> The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were AEs (12.8%, 12.34% and 14.7%, respectively) and progressive disease (4.5%, 7.8% and 1.7%, respectively).<sup>4</sup>

Selected AEs of interest of any grade in the <i>Calquence</i> combination arm (n=178), <i>Calquence</i> monotherapy arm (n=179) and chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab arm (n=169) included cardiac events (20.8%, 19.0% and 7.7%, respectively), bleeding (47.2%, 41.9% and 11.8%, respectively), hypertension (7.9%, 7.3% and 4.1%, respectively), infections (75.3%, 73.7% and 44.4%, respectively) and second primary malignancies (15.7%, 13.4% and 4.1%, respectively).<sup>4</sup>

<b>CLL
</b>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most common type of leukaemia in adults, with an estimated 114,000 new cases globally in 2017, and the number of people living with CLL is expected to grow with improved treatment as patients live longer with the disease.<sup>1,6-8 </sup>In CLL, too many blood stem cells in the bone marrow become abnormal lymphocytes and these abnormal cells have difficulty fighting infections. As the number of abnormal cells grows there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. This could result in anaemia, infection and bleeding.<sup>6</sup> B-cell receptor signalling through Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is one of the essential growth pathways for CLL.

<b>ELEVATE-RR
</b>ELEVATE-RR (ACE-CL-006) is a randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III non-inferiority trial of <i>Calquence</i> versus ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL after at least one prior therapy, and at least one of the following prognostic factors: presence of 17p deletion, or presence of 11q deletion. In the trial, 533 patients were randomised (1:1) into two arms. Patients in the first arm received <i>Calquence</i> (100mg orally twice daily) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in the second arm received ibrutinib (420mg orally once daily) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.<sup>2</sup>

The primary endpoint for the trial was PFS assessed by an independent review committee (non-inferiority; tested after 250 events, HR upper margin of &lt;1.429).<sup>2</sup> Secondary endpoints included incidence of atrial fibrillation, incidence of Grade 3 or higher infections, incidence of Richter’s transformation (a condition in which CLL changes into an aggressive form of lymphoma) and OS.<sup>2,9</sup>

<b>ELEVATE-TN
</b>ELEVATE-TN (ACE-CL-007) is a randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of <i>Calquence</i> alone or in combination with obinutuzumab versus chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab in previously untreated patients with CLL. In the trial, 535 patients were randomised (1:1:1) into three arms. Patients in the first arm received chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the second arm received <i>Calquence</i> (100mg twice daily until disease progression) in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the third arm received <i>Calquence</i> monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression).<sup>4</sup>

The primary endpoint was PFS in the <i>Calquence</i> and obinutuzumab arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm, assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), and a key secondary endpoint was IRC-assessed PFS in the <i>Calquence</i> monotherapy arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm. Other secondary endpoints included objective response rate, time to next treatment, OS and investigator-assessed PFS.<sup>4 </sup><a id=""_Hlk73301167"" name=""_Hlk73301167""></a>After interim analysis, assessments were by investigator only.<sup>4</sup>

Initial results from the ELEVATE-TN Phase III trial were presented in December 2019 at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exhibition.<sup>10</sup> The findings, along with previously reported data from the Phase III ASCEND trial in relapsed or refractory CLL, supported the approvals of <i>Calquence </i>by the US FDA and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration for the treatment of adult patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and by the European Union and Health Canada for CLL.

<b><i>Calquence
</i></b><i>Calquence</i> (acalabrutinib) is a next-generation, selective inhibitor of BTK. <i>Calquence</i> binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.<sup>11,12 </sup>In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.<sup>11</sup>

<i>Calquence</i> is approved for the treatment of CLL and SLL in the US, approved for CLL in the EU and several other countries worldwide, and approved in Japan for relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL. A Phase I trial is currently underway in Japan for the treatment of front-line CLL.

In the US and several other countries, <i>Calquence</i> is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. The US MCL indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. <i>Calquence</i> is not currently approved for the treatment of MCL in Europe or Japan.

As part of an extensive clinical development programme, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating <i>Calquence</i> in more than 20 company-sponsored clinical trials. <i>Calquence</i> is being evaluated for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, follicular lymphoma and other haematologic malignancies.

WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Updated results from the positive PACIFIC Phase III trial showed AstraZeneca’s IMFINZI<i><sup>®</sup> </i>(durvalumab) demonstrated a sustained, clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) benefit at five years in patients with unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had not progressed following concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT).

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, accounting for about a quarter of all cancer deaths, and 80-85% of patients with lung cancer have NSCLC.<sup>1</sup> One in four patients with NSCLC are diagnosed at Stage III, where the majority of tumors are unresectable (cannot be removed with surgery).<sup>2-3</sup> The approval of IMFINZI<i> </i>in this setting, based on the results of this trial, was the first new treatment to be available to these patients in decades.<sup>4-6</sup>

Results from the updated post-hoc analyses showed an estimated five-year OS rate of 42.9% for patients treated with IMFINZI<i> </i>versus 33.4% for those on placebo after CRT. Median OS was 47.5 months for IMFINZI<i> </i>versus 29.1 for placebo. Following a maximum treatment course of one year, an estimated 33.1% of patients treated with IMFINZI<i> </i>had not progressed five years after enrollment versus 19% for placebo. These results build on the primary PFS and OS analyses published in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> in <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa1709937&amp;esheet=52440364&amp;newsitemid=20210604005100&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=2017&amp;index=1&amp;md5=10acffeb5b7c8fe82913adf6c75d8e33"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">2017</a> and <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa1809697&amp;esheet=52440364&amp;newsitemid=20210604005100&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=2018&amp;index=2&amp;md5=4147d10eeb08211bd60aec582e9f3de3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">2018</a>, which demonstrated a sustained, significant benefit with IMFINZI<i> </i>for these primary endpoints.<sup>7,8</sup>

David Spigel, MD, Chief Scientific Officer at the Sarah Cannon Research Institute, and investigator in the PACIFIC trial, said: “This trial has once again set a new precedent in the treatment of patients with unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Historically, only 15-30% of these patients survived five years but these results show that with up to one year of treatment with IMFINZI, an estimated 43% of patients are still alive at five years. Moreover, three quarters of these patients had also not progressed in that time. This is a momentous achievement at the five-year landmark in this curative-intent setting.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Five-year survival is a clinically significant and emotionally meaningful milestone for people with cancer and their families, and it's incredible to see the majority of patients surviving that long have not progressed four years after completing treatment. These results – the first of their kind in Stage III unresectable lung cancer – reinforce the long-term benefit of IMFINZI<i> </i>as the established standard of care in this curative-intent setting. With trials like PACIFIC and our comprehensive development program in early-stage disease across cancer settings, our strategy is to improve cancer outcomes by treating patients as early as possible, aiming to deliver life-changing treatments that increase the potential for cure.”

In the primary OS analysis of the PACIFIC Phase III trial, the most common adverse events (AEs) (greater than or equal to 20%) among patients treated with IMFINZI<i> </i>versus placebo were cough (35.2% versus 25.2%), fatigue (24.0% versus 20.5%), dyspnea (22.3% versus 23.9%) and radiation pneumonitis (20.2% versus 15.8%). A grade 3 or 4 AE was experienced by 30.5% of patients treated with IMFINZI<i> </i>versus 26.1% for placebo, and 15.4% of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs with IMFINZI<i> </i>versus 9.8% for placebo.<sup>8</sup>

These results were presented on June 4 during the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.

<b>Important Safety Information
</b>There are no contraindications for IMFINZI<sup>®</sup> (durvalumab).

<b>Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
</b>Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue IMFINZI depending on severity. See Dosing and Administration for specific details. In general, if IMFINZI requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 mg to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
</span></b>IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients who did not receive recent prior radiation, the incidence of immune-mediated pneumonitis was 2.0% (28/1414), including fatal (&lt;0.1%), and Grade 3-4 (0.4%) adverse reactions. In patients who received recent prior radiation, the incidence of pneumonitis (including radiation pneumonitis) in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC following definitive chemoradiation within 42 days prior to initiation of IMFINZI in PACIFIC was 16.6% (79/475) in patients receiving IMFINZI and 13.2% (31/234) in patients receiving placebo. Of the 79 patients who received IMFINZI, 1.1% were fatal and 2.5% were Grade 3-4 adverse reactions. The frequency and severity of immune-mediated pneumonitis in patients who did not receive definitive chemoradiation prior to IMFINZI were similar in patients who received IMFINZI as a single agent or with ES-SCLC when in combination with chemotherapy.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis
</span></b>IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated colitis that is frequently associated with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.6% (31/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 4 (0.1%) and Grade 3 (0.3%) adverse reactions.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
</span></b>IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.0% (19/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including fatal (&lt;0.1%) and Grade 3 (0.6%) adverse reactions.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</span></b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b><i>Adrenal Insufficiency</i></b>:<b> </b>IMFINZI can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.4% (7/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (&lt;0.1%) adverse reactions.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Hypophysitis</i></b>:<b><i> </i></b>IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field cuts. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate symptomatic treatment including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Grade 3 hypophysitis/hypopituitarism occurred in &lt;0.1% (1/1889) of patients who received IMFINZI.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Thyroid Disorders</i></b>:<b> </b>IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Thyroiditis</i></b>: Immune-mediated thyroiditis occurred in 0.4% (7/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Hyperthyroidism</i></b><i>:</i> Immune-mediated hyperthyroidism occurred in 1.4% (27/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Hypothyroidism</i></b>:<b> </b>Immune-mediated hypothyroidism occurred in 7.3% (137/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (&lt;0.1%) adverse reactions.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis</i></b>: Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Grade 3 immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in &lt;0.1% (1/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI.</li>
</ul>
<b><span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction
</span></b>IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (5/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (0.1%) adverse reactions.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Dermatology Reactions
</span></b>IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have occurred with PD-1/L-1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative rashes. Immune-mediated rash or dermatitis occurred in 1.6% (30/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (0.4%) adverse reactions.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
</span></b>The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of less than 1% each in patients who received IMFINZI or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies.
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b><i>Cardiac/vascular</i></b>: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Nervous system</i></b>: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Ocular</i></b>: Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment to include blindness can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Gastrointestinal</i></b>: Pancreatitis including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders</i></b>:Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic.</li>
 	<li><b><i>Endocrine</i></b>: Hypoparathyroidism</li>
 	<li><b><i>Other (hematologic/immune)</i></b>: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenia, solid organ transplant rejection.</li>
</ul>
<b>Infusion-Related Reactions
</b>IMFINZI can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt, slow the rate of, or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity. See Dosing and Administration for specific details. For Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions, consider using pre-medications with subsequent doses. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (42/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (0.3%) adverse reactions.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after IMFINZI
</b>Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/L-1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/L-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/L-1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
</b>Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMFINZI and for at least 3 months after the last dose of IMFINZI.

<b>Lactation
</b>There is no information regarding the presence of IMFINZI in human milk; however, because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants from IMFINZI, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.

<b>Adverse Reactions</b>

<b>NOTES TO EDITORS</b>

<b>About Stage III NSCLC
</b>In 2021, an estimated 235,760 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in the United States.<sup>1</sup> Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.<sup>1</sup> Approximately one in four patients with NSCLC in the United States present with Stage III disease, which is estimated to affect over 43,000 patients.<sup>2</sup> The majority of Stage III NSCLC patients are diagnosed with unresectable tumors.<sup>3</sup>

Stage III (locally advanced) NSCLC is divided into three sub-categories (IIIA, IIIB and IIIC), defined by how much the cancer has spread locally and the possibility of surgery.<sup>7</sup> In contrast to Stage IV, when cancer has spread (metastasised) to distant organs, Stage III is currently treated with curative intent.<sup>9,10</sup>

<b>About PACIFIC
</b>The PACIFIC trial was a Phase III, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial of IMFINZI as treatment in “all-comer’” patients (regardless of PD-L1 status) with unresectable Stage III NSCLC whose disease had not progressed following concurrent platinum-based CRT.

The trial was conducted at 235 centers across 26 countries involving 713 patients. The primary endpoints of the trial were PFS and OS, and secondary endpoints included landmark PFS and OS, objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR).

<b>About IMFINZI<sup>®</sup> (durvalumab)
</b>IMFINZI<i> </i>is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumor’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

In addition to approvals in the unresectable Stage III NSCLC setting, IMFINZI is approved for the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) based on the CASPIAN Phase III trial in the EU, US, Japan and many other countries around the world. IMFINZI is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in several countries.

As part of a broad development program, IMFINZI is being tested as a single treatment and in combinations with other anti-cancer treatments for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, biliary tract cancer (a form of liver cancer), esophageal cancer, gastric and gastroesophageal cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and other solid tumors.

<b>About tremelimumab
</b>Tremelimumab is a human monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine that targets the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death. Tremelimumab is being tested in a clinical trial program in combination with IMFINZI in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer and liver cancer.

<b>About AstraZeneca Support Programs
</b>AstraZeneca strives to ensure that appropriate patients and their oncologists have access to IMFINZI and relevant support resources. These include educational resources, an Oncology Nurse Educator program and affordability and reimbursement programs, such as Access 360™.

Additionally, AstraZeneca has launched Lighthouse, a program that provides support to patients during any immune-mediated adverse events they may encounter during treatment, through medically trained Lighthouse Advocates. The program aims to make patients’ treatment experience as comfortable as possible. Find out more about Lighthouse at LighthouseProgram.com or call 1-855-LHOUSE1 (1-855-546-8731).

AstraZeneca is a founding member of the Lung Ambition Alliance, a global coalition working to accelerate innovation and deliver meaningful improvements for people with lung cancer including and beyond treatment.

<b>About AstraZeneca in Immunotherapy
</b>Immunotherapy (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumors. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored in immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumor immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumor types.

AstraZeneca is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial program that includes IMFINZI as a single treatment and in combination with tremelimumab and other novel antibodies in multiple tumor types, stages of disease and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, and small, targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumors.

<p align=""left"">STAMFORD, Conn., June 07, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SWTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing medicines for patients with severe rare diseases and cancer, today announced that the company has entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Seagen Inc. to evaluate nirogacestat, SpringWorks’ investigational gamma secretase inhibitor, in combination with SEA-BCMA, Seagen’s investigational monoclonal antibody targeting B-cell maturation agent (BCMA), in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.</p>
Gamma secretase inhibition prevents the cleavage and shedding of BCMA from the surface of myeloma cells. In preclinical models, nirogacestat has been shown to increase levels of membrane-bound BCMA and reduce levels of soluble BCMA, thereby enhancing the activity of BCMA-targeted therapies.

“We continue to make significant progress advancing nirogacestat as a potential best-in-class cornerstone of BCMA combination therapy for patients with multiple myeloma and are delighted to work with Seagen to study nirogacestat in combination with SEA-BCMA, our first collaboration with a monoclonal antibody targeting BCMA,” said Saqib Islam, Chief Executive Officer of SpringWorks. “Our goal is to meaningfully improve clinical outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma and we look forward to generating clinical data using nirogacestat in combination with BCMA-directed therapies across modalities.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Seagen will sponsor and conduct the Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination, and will assume all costs associated with the study, other than expenses related to the manufacturing of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. Seagen and SpringWorks will also form a joint development committee to manage the clinical study, which is expected to commence in the second half of 2021.

In addition to its ongoing clinical collaborations with BCMA-directed therapies, SpringWorks is conducting a global Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the DeFi Trial) to evaluate nirogacestat as a monotherapy in adults with progressing desmoid tumors.

<strong>About Nirogacestat</strong>
Nirogacestat is an investigational, oral, selective, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical development for desmoid tumors, which are rare and often debilitating and disfiguring soft-tissue tumors. Gamma secretase cleaves multiple transmembrane protein complexes, including Notch, which is believed to play a role in activating pathways that contribute to desmoid tumor growth.

In addition, gamma secretase has been shown to directly cleave membrane-bound BCMA, resulting in the release of the BCMA extracellular domain, or ECD, from the cell surface. By inhibiting gamma secretase, membrane-bound BCMA can be preserved, increasing target density while reducing levels of soluble BCMA ECD, which may serve as decoy receptors for BCMA-directed therapies. Nirogacestat’s ability to enhance the activity of BCMA-directed therapies has been observed in preclinical models of multiple myeloma. SpringWorks is evaluating nirogacestat as a BCMA potentiator and has six collaborations with industry-leading BCMA developers to evaluate nirogacestat in combinations across modalities, including with an antibody-drug conjugate, two CAR T cell therapies, two bispecific antibodies and a monoclonal antibody. In addition, SpringWorks and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have entered into a sponsored research agreement to further characterize the ability of nirogacestat to modulate BCMA and potentiate BCMA directed therapies using a variety of preclinical and patient-derived multiple myeloma models developed by researchers at Fred Hutch.

Nirogacestat has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of desmoid tumors and from the European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. The FDA also granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis.

(Tokyo, Japan) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval for ADUHELM™ (aducanumab-avwa) as the first and only Alzheimer’s disease treatment to address a defining pathology of the disease by reducing amyloid beta plaques in the brain.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The accelerated approval has been granted based on data from clinical trials demonstrating the effect of ADUHELM on reducing amyloid beta plaques, a biomarker that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, in this case a reduction in clinical decline. Continued approval for ADUHELM’s indication as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“This historic moment is the culmination of more than a decade of groundbreaking research in the complex field of Alzheimer’s disease. We believe this first-in-class medicine will transform the treatment of people living with Alzheimer’s disease and spark continuous innovation in the years to come,” said Michel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen. “We are grateful for the contributions of thousands of patients and caregivers who participated in our clinical trials, as well as for the dedication of our scientists and researchers. Together with the healthcare community, we are ready to bring this new medicine to patients and begin to address this growing global health crisis.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Eisai has been working on the creation of new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease since the early 80s through our relentless pursuit to understand the root causes of this disease, and we have spent more than a quarter of a century with people living with Alzheimer’s disease to understand their needs,” said Haruo Naito, Chief Executive Officer at Eisai. “We are very pleased to be able to open a new chapter in the history of Alzheimer’s disease treatment with the approval of ADUHELM. This approval has the potential to bring hope to the future of global health, society and, most importantly, the patients and their families, and represents a great step toward the advancement of holistic ecosystem solutions for this devastating disease.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The efficacy of ADUHELM was evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials—EMERGE (Study 1) and ENGAGE (Study 2)—in patients with early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia) with confirmed presence of amyloid pathology. The effects of ADUHELM were also assessed in the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 1b study, PRIME (Study 3). In these studies, ADUHELM consistently showed a dose- and time-dependent effect on the lowering of amyloid beta plaques (by 59 percent [p&lt;0.0001] in ENGAGE, 71 percent [p&lt;0.0001] in EMERGE, and 61 percent [p&lt;0.0001] in PRIME).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ADUHELM safety profile is well characterized in over 3,000 patients who received at least one dose of ADUHELM. The most frequently reported adverse event was radiographic detection of events termed Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities, or “ARIA.” ARIA (-E and/or -H) was observed in 41 percent of patients treated with ADUHELM 10 mg/kg compared to 10 percent of patients on placebo. Clinical symptoms were present in 24 percent of patients treated with ADUHELM 10 mg/kg who had an observation of ARIA (-E and/or -H), compared to 5 percent of patients on placebo. The most common symptom in patients with ARIA was headache. Other symptoms associated with ARIA included confusion, dizziness, visual disturbances, and nausea. Adverse reactions that were reported in at least 2 percent of patients treated with ADUHELM and at least 2 percent more frequently than in patients on placebo were ARIA-E, headache, ARIA-H microhemorrhage, ARIA-H superficial siderosis, fall, diarrhea, and confusion/delirium/altered mental status/disorientation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As part of the accelerated approval, Biogen will conduct a controlled trial to verify the clinical benefit of ADUHELM in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dr. Stephen Salloway, Director of Neurology and the Memory and Aging Program at Butler Hospital, said, “This approval represents a major advance in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. By reducing amyloid beta plaques in the brain, we are addressing one of the defining pathologies of the disease. People with Alzheimer’s disease, together with their doctors, can now decide if the treatment is right for them.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Today’s approval of ADUHELM is a transformational breakthrough in the fight to stop this horrible disease. After years of disappointment and despair, this decision offers new hope for many families and a trigger for future investment and innovation,” said George Vradenburg, Chairman and Co-Founder of UsAgainstAlzheimer’s. “Because ADUHELM was studied in people with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease, it will be important for our nation’s healthcare system—patients, providers and payers—to be ready for earlier detection, diagnosis and intervention in the treatment of the disease.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>INDICATION and IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>INDICATION</strong>
ADUHELM is a prescription medicine used to treat people with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>
<strong>What is the most important information a patient should know about ADUHELM?</strong>
<strong>ADUHELM can cause serious side effects including: Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities or “ARIA”</strong>. <strong>ARIA is a common side effect that does not usually cause any symptoms but can be serious.</strong> It is most commonly seen as temporary swelling in areas of the brain that usually resolves over time. Some people may also have small spots of bleeding in or on the surface of the brain with the swelling. Although most people with swelling in areas of the brain do not have symptoms, some people may have symptoms such as: headache, confusion, dizziness, vision changes, and nausea. The patient’s healthcare provider will do magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans before and during treatment with ADUHELM to check for ARIA. <strong>Patients should call their healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if they have any of the symptoms listed above.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Before receiving ADUHELM, patients should tell their healthcare provider about all of their medical conditions, including if</strong>: they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ADUHELM will harm their unborn baby or if aducanumab-avwa (the active ingredient in ADUHELM) passes into breast milk.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>What are the possible side effects of ADUHELM? ADUHELM can cause serious side effects, including: See above “What is the most important information a patient should know about ADUHELM?”</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Serious allergic reactions</strong>. Swelling of the face, lips, mouth, or tongue and hives have happened during an ADUHELM infusion.

Interim data from the Phase 1b ELEVATE trial support continued development in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and argenx plans to evaluate options to enable a path forward.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">“We have valued the productive collaboration with Janssen that has advanced our understanding of cusatuzumab and its role in AML biology. Together we have generated clinical and translational data that have optimized the dose of cusatuzumab and further characterized its effect on cells in the bone marrow,” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren, Chief Executive Officer of argenx. ""We set our target high with the ELEVATE trial, recognizing that cusatuzumab would have to add benefit to an already-established combination regimen. We believe these interim data show that cusatuzumab could be meaningful to AML patients. We plan to evaluate all alternatives to advance cusatuzumab on behalf of the AML community, while maintaining our focus on our priorities - the launch of efgartigimod and the development of our autoimmune pipeline.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">The ongoing Phase 1b ELEVATE trial is evaluating cusatuzumab in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in newly-diagnosed, elderly patients with AML. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 44 patients. Early efficacy analyses conducted in all evaluable patients (N=42) after ongoing patients had completed at least two disease evaluations showed:</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""disc"">
 	<li>Complete remission (CR) was observed in 48% (20/42), composite complete remission (CRc) including CRs with incomplete hematologic recovery was observed in 81% (34/42), and overall response rate (ORR) in 93% (39/42) of the evaluable population.</li>
 	<li>Cusatuzumab was observed to be well-tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with prior studies.</li>
 	<li>ELEVATE is ongoing; complete results will be presented in an upcoming peer-reviewed forum.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Additionally, ongoing translational research on AML patient bone marrow samples from the Phase 2 CULMINATE trial show a decrease in primitive, monocytic-like blasts and leukemic stem cells, and an increase in normal myeloid cells, following treatment with cusatuzumab and azacitidine.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">The collaboration and licensing agreement between argenx and Janssen was initiated in 2018 to develop cusatuzumab to treat AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Under the terms of the agreement, argenx received $300 million in an upfront payment, approximately $200 million in an equity investment from Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation – JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), and $25 million in milestone payments to date. argenx was notified of Janssen’s decision to discontinue the collaboration agreement during a regularly scheduled steering committee meeting on June 4, 2021. Following termination of the collaboration, argenx can elect that Janssen operationally support the treatment and follow-up of patients enrolled in ongoing cusatuzumab clinical trials.</p>

The test will be available in countries accepting the CE mark through pharmacies and other locations, in packs of five tests.

An early version of the test has already been available as a home-test in a number of European markets under local special approval pathways since February 2021. With the CE Mark, the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self Test Nasal for rapid self testing of COVID-19 test has received official approval following the traditional registration pathway and can now also be used in markets that have not established regulatory exemption pathways.

By following simple instructions, individuals can perform the test at home using a nasal swab without special training or the supervision of a healthcare worker. The test provides results in as little as 15 minutes and can help people to conveniently check if they are likely to be infectious from the comfort of their home. In the case of children under 18 years of age, the test must be performed by an adult or under close adult supervision.

As societies begin to reopen and in line with local health regulations, the convenient test allows individuals planning to attend an event or gathering to use the test as a tool to confirm that they are not likely to be carriers of a substantial amount of the virus thus helping them make informed decisions and reduce the risk of transmission to others.

Complementary to the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self Test Nasal, Roche is offering NAVIFY® Pass. This digital solution allows individuals and healthcare professionals to remotely store, display, and share their COVID-19 test results and vaccine status through a personalised QR code. Having easy digital access to test results and vaccination status could potentially be used by both individuals and companies to facilitate access to locations with COVID-19 entry protocols, such as restaurants or entertainment venues, as well as to validate safety to travel.

“As the world prepares to reopen, high-quality, home-based testing will play an important role in the battle against the pandemic,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO, Roche Diagnostics. “Regular self-testing at home can reduce pressure on healthcare systems. It can quickly identify people with the highest potential to be infectious so they can take immediate action to seek medical advice, manage their infection and protect others.”

This test is part of a partnership with SD Biosensor Inc., with whom Roche has also launched a SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test in July 2020 and two SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Tests for professional use in September 2020 and February 2021. These tests will continue to play an important role in fighting this pandemic and remain available for healthcare professional testing.

In addition to diagnostic testing, preventive measures remain key to protecting yourself and others against SARS-CoV-2. It is recommended to continue wearing masks, socially distance and practice good hygiene, especially if you have symptoms or known contact with others who have tested positive for the virus.

Roche continues to expand its comprehensive COVID-19 portfolio to support healthcare systems in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection.

<strong>About the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen </strong><strong>Self Test</strong><strong> Nasal for at-home patient self-testing</strong>
The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Self Test Nasal is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay (lateral flow assay) for the detection of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in human nasal samples. Each test contains a unique QR code to enable individuals to share their test results and vaccine status using NAVIFY Pass, Roche’s digital solution. For more information on NAVIFY Pass, visit <a title=""www.navifypass.com"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oY70SCFpcox-VfQh7pvqjgWI9hCl5vpA4cd2KuhkkJ0WHxI4_NeBEh2m9IHnvCz69m6OUzcaPDRwZTlrPDFpiu8wW6TI_9UqlbPIVKoYkxU="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.navifypass.com</a>

The clinical performance of the test was measured by head to head comparison with Roche’s highly sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test using nasopharyngeal swab samples as a comparator, the gold standard sampling and detection method for SARS-CoV-2 detection.<sup>1,2</sup> Combined study results showed that the relative sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self Test Nasal was 91.1%.** The overall relative specificity was 99.6 %,<sup>3</sup> which represents the ability of the test to correctly identify patients without the virus. In one comparative independent self testing study where patients followed written and illustrated instructions to sample, test and read-out the results themselves, the majority of study participants considered the procedures easy to perform.<sup>4</sup>

<strong>About antigen testing</strong>
An antigen test detects proteins which are structural or functional components of a pathogen and are very specific to that pathogen.<sup>5</sup> In this case, the test would provide a qualitative “yes/no” answer on the presence of the antigen in the patient sample and can be offered as a rapid strip test that is performed at the point of care. If the target antigen (nucleocapsid protein) is present in sufficient concentrations in the sample, it will bind to specific antibodies and generate a visually detectable signal on the test strip, typically with results ready in 15 minutes. A rapid antigen test can reliably detect individuals with a high viral load allowing healthcare professionals to quickly identify those patients at the greatest risk of spreading the infection.<sup>6</sup>

<strong>About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with varying developments from country to country and we are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients receive the tests, treatment and care they need. This new test is an additional step in Roche’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already included:</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""disc"">
 	<li>Launching COVID-19 diagnostic tests for active infection and the detection of antibodies in patients who have been exposed to the virus,</li>
 	<li>Investigating treatments from our existing portfolio to better understand their potential to treat patients with COVID-19,</li>
 	<li>Increasing manufacturing and supply chain capacity to meet product demand across our portfolio within the wider context of COVID-19 treatment, and</li>
 	<li>Ensuring the supply of our existing medicines and diagnostics to patients around the world under exceptional conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 13 March 2020 we received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May 2020, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA Emergency Use Authorization and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Also in June of last year we received an FDA EUA for the Elecsys® IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as launching Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic. In July of 2020, we added a Rapid Antibody Test, with SD Biosensor as manufacturing partner, to the portfolio that allows the detection of antibodies against COVID-19 at the point of care. In addition, we also launched a Rapid Antigen Test in September and a lab-based Antigen Test in December. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

Roche is actively involved in understanding the potential of the existing portfolio and is researching options for the future. Roche has an ongoing clinical trial program evaluating the role of Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) in COVID-19 pneumonia. On 29 July 2020 Roche announced that the COVACTA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient mortality. The study was the first global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial investigating Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Roche remains committed to continuing the Actemra/RoActemra clinical trial programme in COVID-19 to further explore Actemra/RoActemra in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral. In addition to COVACTA, Roche has initiated several studies to further investigate Actemra/RoActemra as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including two phase III clinical trials, REMDACTA and EMPACTA, as well as the phase II MARIPOSA trial. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations. On 19 August 2020, Roche announced a partnership with Regeneron to develop, manufacture and distribute REGN-COV2, Regeneron’s investigational antiviral antibody combination, to people around the globe. On 18 October 2020, Roche announced a collaboration with Atea Pharmaceuticals to develop a potential oral treatment for COVID-19 patients.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We are excited by the acceptance of our filing for tislelizumab in patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors, which underscores our ongoing commitment to pursuing the full potential of tislelizumab, a potentially differentiated checkpoint inhibitor, and expanding its access where there is unmet medical need. This submission also marks the seventh indication submitted to health authorities, including three approvals for our tislelizumab program,” commented Yong (Ben) Ben, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Immuno-Oncology at BeiGene. “Results from our Phase 2 trial demonstrated that tislelizumab’s treatment effect was consistent and durable across tumor types and endpoints. We are encouraged by the data and plan to continue our communications with the CDE, hoping to bring this medicine to more patients.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The sBLA is supported by clinical results from a single-arm, multi-center, open-label, pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03736889) to evaluate efficacy and safety of tislelizumab as monotherapy in patients with previously treated locally advanced unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors, with an enrollment of 80 patients in China. Patients received tislelizumab 200 mg intravenously every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Radiological imaging was performed at nine weeks and then every six weeks for the first year of therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary efficacy analysis set included patients who received any dose of tislelizumab with measurable disease per independent review committee (IRC) at baseline. The primary endpoint of this trial is objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by IRC per RECIST v1.1; secondary endpoints include time to response (TTR), duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator and IRC, overall survival (OS), and safety and tolerability. Results of this study were presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Microsatellite Instability-High or Mismatch Repair Deficient Solid Tumors</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancer cells have a greater than normal number of genetic markers called microsatellites, which are short, repeated sequences of DNA. Cancer cells that have large numbers of microsatellites may have defects in the ability to correct mistakes (also known as mismatch repair deficiency, or dMMR) that occur when DNA is copied in the cell. MSI-H and dMMR tumors are found most often in colorectal cancer and other types of gastrointestinal cancer and endometrial cancer, although they may also be found in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder and thyroid. <sup>i</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Tislelizumab</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc?R on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to Fc?R on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Tislelizumab is the first drug from BeiGene’s immuno-oncology biologics program and is being developed internationally as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has granted tislelizumab approval in three indications, including full approval for first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy; and conditional approval for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL) who received at least two prior therapies and for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with PD-L1 high expression whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Full approval for these indications is contingent upon results from ongoing randomized, controlled confirmatory clinical trials.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, four supplemental Biologics License Applications for tislelizumab have been accepted by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the NMPA and are under review for first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy, for second- or third-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy, for patients with previously treated with at least one systemic therapy hepatocellular carcinoma and for patients with previously treated, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) solid tumors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">BeiGene has initiated or completed 17 potentially registration-enabling clinical trials in China and globally, including 13 Phase 3 trials and four pivotal Phase 2 trials.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","MONTREAL, June 7, 2021 /CNW/ – AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that Health Canada has approved RINVOQ® (upadacitinib, 15 mg), an oral, once-daily selective and reversible JAK inhibitor for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate or other Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs).3

“Psoriatic arthritis is a debilitating disease that can cause severe pain, restricted mobility, and lasting structural damage.4, 5 The immune system creates inflammation that can lead to skin lesions associated with psoriasis, as well as pain, fatigue and stiffness in the joints,” 6,7 said Dr. Proton Rahman, FRCPC, Clinical Rheumatologist at Eastern Health and University Research Professor at Memorial University.  “Despite treatment advances, some people living with PsA do not achieve their treatment goals, which is why access to new therapies is so critical. The approval of RINVOQ offers Canadian physicians and their patients an important new therapeutic option.”

“I have had psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis for more than 30 years. At one point, most of my body was covered in psoriasis, and I was using arm and leg braces to help me walk. These diseases have had a huge impact on my life, which is why I am so pleased that Canadians with psoriatic arthritis now have a new treatment option available to them,” said Marilyn Porth, of Winnipeg, Manitoba.

This approval is supported by data from two Phase 3 studies across a broad range of more than 2,000 patients with active psoriatic arthritis.1,2 In both studies, RINVOQ met the primary endpoint of ACR20 response at week 12 versus placebo.1,2 RINVOQ 15 mg also achieved non-inferiority versus adalimumab in terms of ACR20 response at week 12.1 Patients receiving RINVOQ also experienced greater improvements in physical function (HAQ-DI*) and skin symptoms (PASI 75*), and a greater proportion achieved minimal disease activity.1,2 Overall, the safety profile of RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis was consistent with previously reported results across the Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial program, with no new significant safety risks detected.1,2,8

“The approval of RINVOQ is wonderful news for Canadians living with psoriatic arthritis, and an important step forward for the psoriatic arthritis community,” says Wendy Gerhart, Executive Director, Canadian Spondylitis Association. “From our recent member surveys, we know this devastating disease has a profound impact on people’s quality of life including their physical and mental health. This approval provides a new treatment option to Canadian patients. It is a hopeful time for people living with psoriatic arthritis.”

“For more than 20 years, AbbVie has been dedicated to discovering and delivering innovative therapies for people living with rheumatic diseases,” added Tracey Ramsay, Vice President and General Manager, AbbVie Canada. “We are proud of our deep heritage in rheumatology and pleased to expand our portfolio of treatment options for Canadians living with psoriatic arthritis, particularly by offering people the convenience of a once-daily oral medication.”

*Physical function was measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Skin symptoms were measured by a 75 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75). Minimal disease activity is defined as the fulfillment of five of seven outcome measures: Tender joint count =1; swollen joint count =1; PASI =1 or body surface area-psoriasis =3 percent; Patient’s Assessment of Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) =1.5; Patient Global Assessment-Disease Activity NRS =2.0; HAQ-DI score =0.5; and Leeds Enthesitis Index =1.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

BERLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bayer AG announced today that BlueRock Therapeutics (BlueRock), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Bayer AG, successfully administered the first dose of its investigational pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons, named DA01, to a Parkinson’s disease patient in their open-label Phase 1 clinical safety and tolerability study. In parallel a gene therapy investigational program also targeted at providing advanced therapies for Parkinson’s disease is driven forward by Bayer’s wholly-owned clinical-stage adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy company Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc. (AskBio). This program is currently recruiting and evaluating patients in an ongoing Phase 1b clinical study to assess safety and preliminary efficacy.

“The potential of BlueRock and AskBio’s clinical candidates to treat Parkinson’s disease and truly help patients with their high unmet medical need could be immense,” said Wolfram Carius, Head of Cell and Gene Therapy at Bayer. “We are still in early phases of clinical trials, but passionately committed to advancing breakthrough science to improve the lives of patients who have been waiting for way too long for innovative treatments.”

Parkinson’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, impacting more than 10 million people worldwide. It is caused by nerve cell (neuron) damage in the brain, leading to decreased levels of dopamine (a neurotransmitter involved in processes such as memory or movement). The disease often starts with a tremor in one hand. Other symptoms include rigidity, cramping and dyskinesias (involuntary, erratic, writhing movements of the face, arms, legs or trunk). Dopamine substitutes, such as levodopa, are commonly used to mitigate the symptoms of the disease, but their effect diminishes as the disease progresses and there is currently no disease-modifying treatment available. By targeting the disease at its root cause, cell and gene therapies aim to go beyond symptomatic treatments.

Using authentic dopaminergic neurons, BlueRock aims to re-innervate the affected regions of the human brain and reverse the degenerative process, potentially restoring motor function. BlueRock’s clinical trial will enroll ten patients at sites in the United States of America (US) and Canada. In this study, patients undergo surgical transplantation of the dopamine-producing cells into the putamen, a deep brain structure affected by Parkinson’s disease. The primary objective of the Phase 1 study (NCT04802733) is to assess the safety and tolerability of DA01 cell transplantation at one-year post-transplant. The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the evidence of transplanted cell survival and motor effects at one- and two-years post-transplant, to evaluate continued safety and tolerability at two years, and to assess feasibility of transplantation.

AskBio’s approach consists of an AAV that delivers human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene to the neurons within the putamen, resulting in expression and secretion of GDNF protein in brain regions impacted by Parkinson’s disease. Long-term experiments using AAV-GDNF showed that sustained expression of GDNF can promote regeneration of midbrain neurons and significant motor recovery in rodents and non-human primate models. AskBio’s clinical study is currently recruiting and evaluating patients in Phase 1b in the US to assess safety and preliminary efficacy. A total of 10 patients have been enrolled since the start of the Phase 1b study (NCT04167540) in August 2020.

<span class=""xn-location"">OKLAHOMA CITY</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 8, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <u>Progentec</u>, a leader in diagnostic and digital technologies for the proactive management of autoimmune diseases, announced today an 18-month collaborative research agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to evaluate novel measurement and management tools for systemic lupus erythematosus (""SLE"" or ""lupus"").

At least 5 million people worldwide are living with lupus, one of the most complex autoimmune diseases<sup>i</sup>. It's difficult to diagnose and even more challenging to treat<sup>ii</sup>. The condition is associated with a range of debilitating symptoms that can fluctuate over time, including painful or swollen joints, extreme fatigue, unexplained fever, skin rashes, and organ damage<sup>ii</sup>. Up to 50% of SLE patients experience irreversible organ damage within five years of diagnosis and this damage is associated with a poor long-term prognosis and early mortality<sup>iii iv v</sup>

Patient-generated data, including data from wearable devices, is becoming an integral part of chronic disease care as it enables continuous monitoring of pertinent health signals both in and outside of the clinic. These signals increase in predictive value when combined with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and lupus-specific laboratory testing. The research agreement between Progentec and GSK supports two <span class=""xn-location"">United States</span>-based studies that will evaluate how new-to-market clinical tools, including proteomics and digital health, may help achieve a more proactive approach to lupus management.
<ol type=""1"">
 	<li><b>Study One</b> will evaluate the impact of aisle™ MGMT on the clinical decision-making process. aiSLE™ MGMT is a comprehensive lupus management platform created by Progentec. The platform includes the aiSLE™ DX Flare Risk Index test, the [AutoimmuneCorner]™ patient app, a smartwatch, and access to lupus-specific health coaching. Clinicians receive the aiSLE™ MGMT clinical report each month which may support the delivery of personalized care and the prevention or reduction in severity of lupus flares.</li>
 	<li><b>Study Two</b> expands on the OASIS Study, a fully-decentralized clinical study launched by Progentec in 2020 and powered by Progentec's LupusCorner® Research platform. The OASIS Study explores how patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and data from a wearable device may contribute to the development of lupus-specific digital biomarkers and provide insight into changes in lupus disease activity.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved PREVNAR 20<sup>™</sup> (Pneumococcal 20-valent Conjugate Vaccine) for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by the 20 <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (pneumococcus) serotypes in the vaccine in adults ages 18 years and older. Following today’s FDA approval, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is expected to meet in October to discuss and update recommendations on the safe and appropriate use of pneumococcal vaccines in adults.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

PREVNAR 20 includes capsular polysaccharide conjugates for the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) already included in Prevnar 13<sup>®</sup> (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM<sub>197</sub> Protein]). The vaccine also contains capsular polysaccharide conjugates for seven additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F and 33F) that cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD),<sup>8,9,10,11,12</sup> and have been associated with high case-fatality rates,<sup>13,14,15,16</sup> antibiotic resistance,<sup>4,17,18</sup> and/or meningitis.<sup>19,20</sup>

“Today’s approval of PREVNAR 20 marks a significant step forward in our ongoing fight to help address the burden of pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia in adults, and broadens global protection against more disease-causing serotypes than any other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines,” said Kathrin U. Jansen, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research &amp; Development, Pfizer. “With a single injection, PREVNAR 20 provides adults with strong and meaningful protection against serotypes responsible for the majority of circulating pneumococcal disease around the world.”

In the United States, more than half of all cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) – which include bacteremia and meningitis – in adults ages 65 or older are due to the 20 serotypes in PREVNAR 20.<sup>21</sup> In the United States, these 20 serotypes are estimated to cause up to 250,000 cases of IPD (including bacteremia and meningitis) and community-acquired pneumonia and more than 10,000 deaths in adults ages 18 or older.<sup>22</sup> Overall, the seven additional serotypes in PREVNAR 20 account for approximately 40 percent of all pneumococcal disease cases and deaths in the U.S.<sup>23</sup>

“Adult vaccinations play a pivotal role in helping protect our health and wellness, especially as we age and our immune systems begin to naturally weaken,” said Jane Barratt, Ph.D., Secretary General, International Federation on Ageing (IFA). “We are delighted with today’s approval as it addresses a critical need to continually expand coverage to meet the changing burden of disease. We encourage all adults to speak with their healthcare professionals about vaccinations.”

The FDA’s decision is based on evidence from Pfizer’s clinical program in adults, including Phase 1 and 2 trials, and three Phase 3 trials (NCT03760146, NCT03828617, and NCT03835975) describing the safety and evaluating the immunogenicity of the vaccine. More than 6,000 adult subjects 18 years and older participated in the three Phase 3 trials, including adults 65 years of age and older, vaccine-naïve adults, and adults with prior pneumococcal vaccination.<sup>23,24</sup>

“PREVNAR 20 builds on Pfizer’s legacy of more than two decades of experience in developing and supplying innovative pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that have had a tangible impact on global disease burden,” said Nanette Cocero, Ph.D., Global President of Pfizer Vaccines. “We are thrilled with this approval as it furthers our mission to expand protection against disease-causing bacteria serotypes to help prevent potentially serious respiratory infections like pneumococcal pneumonia throughout the year.”

<b>About 20-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Regulatory Review</b>

On September 20, 2018, Pfizer announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for PREVNAR 20 for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia in adults age 18 years or older. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs and vaccines that are intended to treat or prevent serious conditions and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or vaccine may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s).<sup>25</sup> Drugs and vaccines that receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation are eligible for all features of the FDA’s Fast Track designation, which may include more frequent communication with the FDA about the drug’s development plan and eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, if relevant criteria are met.<sup>26</sup>

The FDA previously granted Fast Track designation for PREVNAR 20 in September 2017 for use in adults aged 18 years or older.<sup>27</sup> The FDA’s Fast Track approach is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs and vaccines intended to treat or prevent serious conditions and address an unmet medical need.<sup>25</sup>

On February 26, 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review Pfizer’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate, as submitted for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by <i>S. pneumoniae</i> serotypes in the vaccine in adults ages 18 years and older. The formal review process by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) currently is ongoing.

<span class=""xn-location"">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 8, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --<b> Cardiff Oncology, Inc.</b> (Nasdaq: CRDF), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing onvansertib to treat cancers with the greatest medical needs for new treatment options, including KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer and castrate-resistant prostate cancer, announced today that the first patient has been dosed in its Phase 2 clinical trial of onvansertib in combination with nanoliposomal irinotecan and 5-FU as a second-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

The Phase 2 open-label, multicenter trial, which is an integral part of Cardiff Oncology's focus on KRAS-mutated solid tumor cancers, is designed to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of onvansertib in combination with standard-of-care as a second-line treatment in patients with metastatic PDAC who have failed first-line gemcitabine-based therapy. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 40 patients across six sites in the U.S., including the three Mayo Clinic Cancer Centers (<span class=""xn-location"">Arizona</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Minnesota</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Florida</span>), <span class=""xn-org"">Kansas University</span> Medical Center, The <span class=""xn-org"">University of Nebraska Medical Center</span> and Inova Schar Cancer Institute.

""We believe that adding onvansertib to standard-of-care therapy may improve the current dim prognosis for PDAC patients where currently second-line treatment confers only a 7.7% response rate and 3.1-month median progression-free survival,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Daniel H. Ahn</span>, D.O., principal investigator for the trial and medical oncologist, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, <span class=""xn-location"">Arizona</span>. ""There is increasing evidence in the ongoing Phase 2 trial in KRAS-mutated mCRC that the synergistic effect of onvansertib in combination with irinotecan and 5-FU is resulting in meaningful clinical benefit and improving outcomes for patients with KRAS-mutated cancers and we are optimistic that we will see similar results in this PDAC trial.""

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Mark Erlander</span>, chief executive officer of Cardiff Oncology added, ""Onvansertib's inhibitory effect on the proliferation and survival of KRAS-mutated tumor cells has, notably, shown synergistic clinical benefit in combination with irinotecan and 5-FU in our KRAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer trial (mCRC). As metastatic PDAC tumors bear KRAS mutations about 95% of the time, we see an opportunity for onvansertib to improve response rates and increase progression-free survival in this indication with such marked unmet need. The dosing of the first patient in our Phase 2 PDAC trial represents an important step in pursuit of this opportunity, and we look forward to its continued progress.""

<b>About the Phase 2 Trial of Onvansertib in Metastatic PDAC</b>

This trial is an open-label, multi-center study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of onvansertib in combination with nanoliposomal irinotecan (Onyvide®), leucovorin, and 5-FU as a second-line treatment in patients with metastatic PDAC. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 40 patients with histologically confirmed measurable and metastatic PDAC who have failed treatment with one prior line of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Patients will receive nanoliposomal irinotecan, leucovorin, and 5-FU on Day 1 of 14-day cycles in combination with onvansertib 12 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Days 1-10, or 15 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, on Days 1-5 of each 14-day cycle. The study will be conducted at six clinical trial sites across the U.S: Mayo Clinic (<span class=""xn-location"">Arizona</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Minnesota</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Florida</span>), <span class=""xn-org"">Kansas University</span> Medical Center, The <span class=""xn-org"">University of Nebraska Medical Center</span> and Inova Schar Cancer Institute. The primary endpoint will be objective response rate (<span class=""xn-location"">ORR</span>) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Key secondary and exploratory endpoints include duration of response, median overall survival, <span class=""xn-location"">ORR</span> in patients receiving more than two treatment cycles, disease control rate (defined as complete response, partial response or stable disease by RECIST v1.1 over the entire treatment period), and assessment of KRAS allelic burden in liquid biopsies as measured by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).

<b>About Cardiff Oncology, Inc.</b>

Cardiff Oncology is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with the singular mission of developing new treatment options for cancer patients in indications with the greatest medical need. Our goal is to overcome resistance, improve response to treatment and increase overall survival.  We are developing onvansertib, a first-in-class, third-generation Polo-like Kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitor, in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy and targeted therapeutics. Our clinical development programs incorporate tumor genomics and biomarker technology to enable assessment of patient response to treatment.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Caraway Therapeutics today announced an exclusive, collaboration and option agreement with AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) to develop and commercialize Caraway’s small molecule therapeutics targeting TMEM175, a potassium ion channel critical to lysosomal function implicated in both Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders.

TMEM175 is a compelling target with strong genetic support. Loss of function mutations in TMEM175 are associated with reduced lysosomal efficiency in a subpopulation of PD patients, that can manifest as earlier age of disease onset or elevated risk of dementia relative to idiopathic PD. Under this collaboration, Caraway will continue to advance proprietary small molecule TMEM175 modulators, leveraging Caraway’s unique drug discovery platform and expertise in lysosomal biology and cellular clearance mechanisms, and combine with AbbVie’s expertise in disease biology, clinical development, and global commercialization.

“TMEM175 is a compelling genetically validated target for which Caraway has developed a promising drug discovery program. Collaborating with Caraway to advance TMEM175 modulators has great potential to fit with AbbVie’s efforts to develop transformative treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases,” said Eric Karran, Ph.D., Vice President, Neuroscience Discovery at AbbVie.

“We are delighted to partner with AbbVie on Caraway’s TMEM175 pipeline program for Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders,” said Martin D. Williams, Chief Executive Officer of Caraway Therapeutics. “Variants in TMEM175 that reduce lysosomal function are highly prevalent genetic risk factors for the development of PD and evidence suggests that patients with reduced TMEM175 function tend to have earlier age of disease onset and increased risk of dementia. We are looking forward to collaborating with AbbVie to develop novel TMEM175 modulators and bring new hope to patients suffering from Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative disorders.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Caraway will receive an upfront cash payment of $17 million. After Caraway completes certain pre-clinical research and development activities for the collaboration program, AbbVie has an option to license the program and proceed into IND-enabling studies, clinical development, and commercialization.

Caraway is eligible to receive up to $267 million in payments, including upfront and future option payments, and development milestones. Caraway is also eligible to receive additional regulatory and commercial milestones, tiered royalties on global commercial sales, and has the option to participate in product development in return for higher royalty rates.

Caraway is a portfolio company of AbbVie Ventures.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced it has entered into a procurement agreement with the United States government for molnupiravir (MK-4482). Molnupiravir is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial, the MOVe-OUT study, for the treatment of non-hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes. Merck is developing molnupiravir in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.

“Merck is pleased to collaborate with the U.S. government on this new agreement that will provide Americans with COVID-19 access to molnupiravir – an investigational oral therapy being studied for outpatient use early in the course of disease – if it is authorized or approved,” said Rob Davis, president, Merck. “In addition to this agreement with the U.S. government, we are actively engaged in numerous efforts to make molnupiravir available globally to fulfill Merck’s commitment to widespread access.”

Through the agreement, if molnupiravir receives Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Merck will receive approximately $1.2 billion to supply approximately 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir to the United States government. Merck has been investing at risk to support development and scale-up production of molnupiravir and expects to have more than 10 million courses of therapy available by the end of 2021.

Merck also plans to submit applications for emergency use or approval to regulatory bodies outside of the U.S. and is currently in discussions with other countries interested in advance purchase agreements for molnupiravir. Merck is committed to providing timely access to molnupiravir globally and intends to implement a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank data that recognizes countries’ relative ability to finance their public health response to the pandemic.

As part of its access strategy, Merck has also entered into non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for molnupiravir with established generic manufacturers to accelerate availability of molnupiravir in 104 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies.

In addition to developing molnupiravir, Merck is contributing to the pandemic response by collaborating with Johnson &amp; Johnson to support the manufacture of its COVID-19 vaccine.

This procurement of molnupiravir will be supported in whole or in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, in collaboration with the DOD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) under contract number W911QY21C0031.

<b>About Molnupiravir</b>

Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801/MK-4482) is an investigational, orally bioavailable form of a potent ribonucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of multiple RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Molnupiravir has been shown to be active in several models of SARS-CoV-2, including for prophylaxis, treatment and prevention of transmission, as well as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS. EIDD-2801 was invented at Drug Innovations at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, a not-for-profit biotechnology company wholly owned by Emory University, and with partial funding support from the U.S. government. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of EIDD-2801 by Ridgeback have been provided by Wayne and Wendy Holman and Merck.

The Phase 3 portion (Part 2) of the MOVe-OUT study, evaluating the potential of molnupiravir to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death, is ongoing. Merck currently anticipates that, pending favorable results from MOVe-OUT, the earliest possible submission for an Emergency Use Authorization for molnupiravir will be in the second half of 2021. Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics plan to share further findings from the ongoing molnupiravir development program with regulatory agencies as they become available. For more information on the molnupiravir clinical trial please visit <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmerckcovidresearch.com%2F&amp;esheet=52442380&amp;newsitemid=20210609005142&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fmerckcovidresearch.com%2F.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=e7c8539f5b4f3bc9bb4fdaef257d9511"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://merckcovidresearch.com/.</a>

In addition, Merck plans to initiate a clinical program to evaluate molnupiravir for post- exposure prophylaxis in the second half of 2021.

<span class=""xn-location"">PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 8, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- INOVIO (NASDAQ:INO), a biotechnology company focused on bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines to treat and protect people from infectious diseases, cancer, and HPV-associated diseases, today announced an expansion of its previously announced partnership with Advaccine Biopharmaceuticals Suzhou Co., Ltd. (""Advaccine"") to jointly conduct a global Phase 3 segment of the ongoing Phase 2/3 trial called INNOVATE (<b><u>IN</u></b>OVIO I<b><u>NO</u></b>-4800 <b><u>Va</u></b>ccine <b><u>T</u></b>rial for <b><u>E</u></b>fficacy). Together, the companies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of INO-4800 in a two-dose regimen (2.0 mg), administered one month apart, in a two-to-one randomization in subjects 18 years and older across several countries, primarily in <span class=""xn-location"">Latin America</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Asia</span>. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 segment will be virologically confirmed COVID-19 disease. The 2.0 mg dose was selected from the Phase 2 segment, where INO-4800 was shown to be generally well-tolerated and immunogenic in all tested age groups.

Dr. J. <span class=""xn-person"">Joseph Kim</span>, President and CEO of INOVIO, said, ""With most countries in the world currently registering COVID vaccination rates of less than 10%, INOVIO and Advaccine feel the urgency to advance INO-4800 into a global Phase 3 trial this summer. INOVIO is encouraged by our recently <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3188678-1&amp;h=4068426742&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Finovio-announces-positive-data-from-phase-2-segment-of-clinical-trial-evaluating-ino-4800-its-covid-19-dna-vaccine-301287416.html&amp;a=published"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">published</a> Phase 2 data for INO-4800, which showed the vaccine to be well-tolerated and immunogenic in all tested age groups. In a <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3188678-1&amp;h=4018136636&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.inovio.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-releases-details%2F2021%2FINOVIOs-COVID-19-Vaccine-Candidate-INO-4800-Provides-Broad-Cross-reactive-Immune-Responses-In-Humans-Against-Variants-of-Concern%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;a=previously+announced+study"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">previously announced study</a>, INO-4800 was also found to generate broad cross-reactive immune responses against tested SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, which may enable it to provide greater protection for more people globally.""
<p class=""prntaj"">Dr. Kim continued, ""We believe that INO-4800, if approved, will be well-positioned to serve the vaccine needs of the global community. Based on trial results to date, this vaccine has shown to be well-tolerated; produces balanced neutralizing antibodies and favorable T cell response (CD8 and CD4) and is easy to administer. It is uniquely positioned to support vaccine rollout to underserved countries globally with a strong thermostability profile that is stable at room temperature for more than a year and does not require cold or ultra-cold-chain transport. In addition to the potential approval as a primary vaccine, INO-4800 also has the potential to be used as a booster vaccine since the early clinical data supports that INO-4800 can be safely re-administered.""</p>
Founder and Chairman of Advaccine, Dr. Bin Wang said, ""The expansion of our partnership with INOVIO has a lot of synergy and we are excited about the global Phase 3 trial of INO-4800. We look forward to bringing a well-tolerated and immunogenic COVID-19 vaccine to more people around the world. Advaccine has built up large scale GMP manufacturing facilities of DNA vaccine and recently obtained the vaccine manufacturing permit from Chinese regulatory authorities, becoming one of a few companies in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> that have the license. We are working to expand our manufacturing capacities further, in order to meet the unmet global need for nucleic acid-based COVID-19 vaccines.""

Under their expanded collaboration, INOVIO and Advaccine intend to share equally, subject to specified limitations and conditions, the total cost of the planned global Phase 3 trial, which is estimated to be approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$100 million</span>. The expanded partnership is an extension of an existing relationship between the two companies, including an exclusive agreement <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3188678-1&amp;h=1228479422&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.inovio.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-releases-details%2F2021%2FINOVIO-and-Advaccine-Announce-Exclusive-Partnership-To-Commercialize-COVID-19-DNA-Vaccine-Candidate-INO-4800-in-Greater-China%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;a=announced"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">announced</a> in <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2021</span> under which Advaccine has the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize INO-4800 within <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span>, inclusive of mainland <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Hong Kong</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Macao</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Taiwan</span>. Under the expanded agreement, Advaccine obtains rights to additional Asian countries outside of <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span>. Advaccine has extensive experience in co-development of INO-4800 with INOVIO, including sponsoring both Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> for INO-4800.

The global Phase 2/3 trial builds upon INOVIO's Phase 2 segment, which was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, (JPEO-CBRND) in coordination with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD(HA)) and the Defense Health Agency. Results from the trial can be found in the paper entitled ""Safety and immunogenicity of INO-4800 DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: A Preliminary Report of a Randomized, Blinded, Placebo-controlled, Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Adults at High Risk of Viral Exposure,"" which has been published as a pre-print in MedRxiv prior to peer review.  Early INO-4800 research and development funding were provided by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

In addition to the initiation of the clinical trial itself, INOVIO is in discussions with several countries which are expected to provide clinical trial sites, regarding advanced market contracts to potentially supply INO-4800 upon respective regulatory approvals in those countries.

<b>About the INO-4800 ""INNOVATE"" Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial</b>

The Phase 2 segment of INNOVATE Phase 2/3 trial was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of INO-4800 in a two-dose regimen (1.0 mg or 2.0 mg) in a three-to-one-randomization to receive either INO-4800 or placebo in three age groups (18-50 years, 51-64 years and 65 years and older). The Phase 2 data showed that INO-4800 was well-tolerated and immunogenic in all tested age groups, and the 2.0 mg dose was selected to advance into the Phase 3 segment of the trial.

The global Phase 3 segment of the trial intends to enroll healthy men and non-pregnant women 18 years of age and older, to evaluate the efficacy of INO-4800 (2.0 mg) in a two-dose regimen based on the Phase 2 dose-confirmation data. The trial will be predominantly conducted in vaccine underserved countries in <span class=""xn-location"">Latin America</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Asia</span>. Participants will be enrolled in a two-to-one randomization to receive either INO-4800 or a placebo. The Phase 3 segment will be case-driven with the final number of enrollees to be determined by the incidence of COVID-19 during the Phase 3 segment. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 segment will be virologically confirmed COVID-19 disease.

<b>About INO-4800</b>

INO-4800 is INOVIO's DNA vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. INOVIO has extensive experience working with coronaviruses and was the first company to initiate a Phase 2a trial for INO-4700, a DNA vaccine candidate for a related coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

Composed of a precisely designed DNA plasmid, INO-4800 is injected intradermally followed by electroporation using a proprietary smart device delivering the DNA plasmid directly into cells in the body and is intended to produce a well-tolerated immune response. INO-4800 is the only nucleic-acid based vaccine that is stable at room temperature for more than a year, at 37<sup>o</sup> C for more than a month, has a five-year projected shelf life at normal refrigeration temperature and does not need to be frozen during transport or storage – all of which are important considerations when preparing for mass immunizations.

<b>About INOVIO's DNA Medicines Platform</b>

INOVIO has 15 DNA medicine clinical programs currently in development and focused on HPV-associated diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, including coronaviruses associated with MERS and COVID-19 that are being developed under grants from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the U.S. Department of Defense. DNA medicines are composed of precisely designed DNA plasmids, which are small circles of double-stranded DNA that are synthesized or reorganized by a computer sequencing technology and designed to produce a specific immune response in the body.

INOVIO's DNA medicines deliver optimized plasmids directly into cells intramuscularly or intradermally using INOVIO's proprietary hand-held smart device called CELLECTRA<sup>®</sup>. The CELLECTRA<sup>®</sup> device uses a brief electrical pulse to reversibly open small pores in the cell to allow the plasmids to enter, overcoming a key limitation of other DNA and other nucleic acid approaches. Once inside the cell, the DNA plasmids enable the cell to produce the targeted antigen. The antigen is processed naturally in the cell and triggers the desired T cell and antibody mediated immune responses. Administration with the CELLECTRA<sup>®</sup> device ensures that the DNA medicine is efficiently delivered directly into the body's cells, where it can go to work to drive an immune response. INOVIO's DNA medicines do not interfere with or change in any way an individual's own DNA. The advantages of INOVIO's DNA medicine platform are the relative speed at which DNA medicines can be designed and manufactured; the stability of the products, which do not require freezing in storage and transport; and the robust immune response, and tolerability that have been observed in clinical trials.

With more than 3,000 patients receiving INOVIO investigational DNA medicines in more than 7,000 applications across a range of clinical trials, INOVIO has a strong track record of rapidly generating DNA medicine candidates with the potential to meet urgent global health needs.

<b>About INOVIO</b>

INOVIO is a biotechnology company focused on rapidly bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines to treat and protect people from infectious diseases, cancer, and diseases associated with HPV. INOVIO is the first and only company to have clinically demonstrated that a DNA medicine can be delivered directly into cells in the body via a proprietary smart device to produce a robust and tolerable immune response. Specifically, INOVIO's lead candidate VGX-3100 is the first DNA medicine to achieve efficacy endpoints in a Phase 3 clinical trial, REVEAL 1, for the treatment of precancerous cervical dysplasia caused by HPV-16 and/or HPV-18. VGX-3100 also demonstrated positive Phase 2 efficacy results in separate trials evaluating the treatment of precancerous vulvar dysplasia and anal dysplasia. Also in development are programs targeting HPV-related cancers and a rare HPV-related disease, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP); non-HPV-related cancers glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and prostate cancer; as well as externally funded infectious disease DNA vaccine development programs in Zika, Lassa fever, Ebola, HIV, and coronaviruses associated with MERS and COVID-19.

<b>About HMBD-001</b>

HMBD-001 is a unique anti-HER3 neutralizing antibody, with a novel mechanism of action that offers significant potential for clinical benefit. Previous attempts to block the HER3 receptor, a key player in the PI3K/MAPK signaling pathways that promotes cell division and tumor growth in cancer, have not proven to be efficacious. HER3 is activated by the binding of NRG1, which stabilizes a transient open conformation to allow it to form heterodimers with HER2/EGFR. In the presence of abundant HER2/EGFR, heterodimers can form without NRG1.

Pre-clinical studies have shown that HMBD-001 potently inhibits the formation of these heterodimers, blocking activation of the signaling pathway – and consequently, prevents tumor growth. Cancer Research UK has partnered with Hummingbird Bioscience to advance this novel drug candidate into clinical trials for the treatment of HER3-driven cancers.

<b>About NRG1 fusions</b>

A subset of patients with cancer have recently been identified who possess abnormal NRG1 gene fusions, that is the hybridization of their NRG1 gene with any one of a number of genes to produce NRG1 fusion proteins that express the HER3-binding domains. This results in increased HER3 binding and HER3 pathway activation, which consequently leads to tumor growth. Less than 0.5% of all solid tumors harbor NRG1 fusions, however their presence is significantly higher in certain types of cancer including pancreatic and lung cancers. Moreover, studies suggest that NRG1 fusions are mutually exclusive with other known molecular drivers of cancer, such as ALK, ROS, and RET gene fusions, and represent a distinct patient population. There are currently no approved therapies to treat this patient population.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 9, 2021-- Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq: VRTX) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved expanded use of TRIKAFTA<sup>® </sup>(elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) to include children with cystic fibrosis (CF) ages 6 through 11 years who have at least one <i>F508del </i>mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene or a mutation in the <i>CFTR </i>gene that is responsive to TRIKAFTA based on <i>in vitro</i> data. TRIKAFTA was previously approved by the FDA for use in people with cystic fibrosis 12 years and older with at least one copy of the <i>F508del</i> mutation or one copy of a mutation that is responsive <i>in vitro</i>. An additional dosage strength of TRIKAFTA tablets is now available (elexacaftor 50 mg/tezacaftor 25 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg and ivacaftor 75 mg) in connection with this approval.

“Today’s approval is a critical milestone in our efforts to deliver medicines that help treat the underlying cause of this devastating disease as early in life as possible,” said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President, Vertex. “We can now reach approximately 1,500 newly eligible children in the U.S., and we continue to pursue approval for this expanded indication in other countries.”

Vertex completed a 24-week Phase 3 open-label, multicenter study which enrolled 66 children ages 6 through 11 years old with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have either two copies of the <i>F508del</i> mutation or one copy of the <i>F508del </i>mutation and one minimal function mutation to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of TRIKAFTA. The regimen was generally well tolerated, and safety data were similar with those observed in previous studies of patients ages 12 years and older. The full data from this study were recently published in <i>American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine</i>.

“Clinical experience with TRIKAFTA in patients 12 and older over the past 20 months has demonstrated this medicine has a meaningful and unprecedented clinical benefit for patients. I look forward to now being able to treat younger patients with this breakthrough medicine, including those who have not presented major signals of disease progression,” said Terri Laguna M.D., M.S.C.S., Associate Director of the Cystic Fibrosis Center and Division Head, Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine, Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “In addition to bringing TRIKAFTA to a younger patient population, patients not previously eligible for any CFTR modulator will now be able to access a treatment that targets the underlying cause of their disease.”

TRIKAFTA<sup>® </sup>is already approved for the treatment of patients with CF ages 12 years and older with certain mutations in the U.S. Switzerland, Australia and Israel, as well as in the EU and the U.K. as KAFTRIO<sup>®</sup> (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in a combination regimen with KALYDECO<sup>®</sup> (ivacaftor). Vertex has submitted applications for use of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in children ages 6 through 11 years to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and plans to file for this expanded use in Switzerland, Australia and Israel this year.

<b>About Cystic Fibrosis</b>

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 80,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-system disease that affects the lungs, liver, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands, pancreas and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the <i>CFTR</i> gene. Children must inherit two defective <i>CFTR</i> genes — one from each parent — to have CF. While there are many different types of <i>CFTR</i> mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of all people with CF have at least one <i>F508del</i> mutation. These mutations, which can be determined by a genetic test, or genotyping test, lead to CF by creating non-working and/or too few CFTR proteins at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage in many patients that eventually leads to death. The median age of death is in the early 30s.

<b>INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TRIKAFTA<sup>®</sup> (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) TABLETS</b>

<b>What is TRIKAFTA?</b>

TRIKAFTA is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one copy of the <i>F508del</i> mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene or another mutation that is responsive to treatment with TRIKAFTA. Patients should talk to their doctor to learn if they have an indicated CF gene mutation. It is not known if TRIKAFTA is safe and effective in children under 6 years of age.

<b>Patients should not take TRIKAFTA if they take certain medicines or herbal supplements, such as:</b> antibiotics such as rifampin or rifabutin; seizure medicines such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin; or St. John’s wort.

<b>Before taking TRIKAFTA, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they: </b>have kidney problems;<b> </b>have or have had liver problems; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant because it is not known if TRIKAFTA will harm an unborn baby; or are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed because it is not known if TRIKAFTA passes into breast milk.

<b>TRIKAFTA may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how TRIKAFTA works. </b>Therefore, the dose of TRIKAFTA may need to be adjusted when taken with certain medicines. Patients should especially tell their doctor if they take: antifungal medicines including ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole; antibiotics including telithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin.

<b>TRIKAFTA may cause dizziness</b> in some people who take it. Patients should not drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything requires alertness until they know how TRIKAFTA affects them.

<b>Patients should avoid </b>food or drink that contains grapefruit while they are taking TRIKAFTA.

<b>TRIKAFTA can cause serious side effects, including:</b>

<b>High liver enzymes in the blood</b>, which is a common side effect in people treated with TRIKAFTA. These can be serious and may be a sign of liver injury. The patient's doctor will do blood tests to check their liver before they start TRIKAFTA, every 3 months during the first year of taking TRIKAFTA, and every year while taking TRIKAFTA. Patients should call their doctor right away if they have any of the following symptoms of liver problems: pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area; yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes; loss of appetite; nausea or vomiting; dark, amber-colored urine.

<b>Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) </b>has happened in some children and adolescents treated with TRIKAFTA. If the patient is a child or adolescent, their doctor should perform eye examinations before and during treatment with TRIKAFTA to look for cataracts.

<b>The most common side effects of TRIKAFTA include</b> headache, upper respiratory tract infection (common cold) including stuffy and runny nose, stomach (abdominal) pain, diarrhea, rash, increase in liver enzymes, increase in a certain blood enzyme called creatine phosphokinase, flu (influenza), inflamed sinuses, and increase in blood bilirubin.

<strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong>
To the extent that statements contained in this press release are not descriptions of historical facts regarding Codexis, they are forward-looking statements reflecting the current beliefs and expectations of management made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including Codexis’ expectations regarding the prospects for the development and future commercialization by Takeda of novel gene therapies for specified target indications.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expansion of the pediatric indication of Epclusa<sup>®</sup> (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) to now include children as young as 3 years of age, regardless of HCV genotype or liver disease severity. The FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for two strengths of an oral pellet formulation of Epclusa (sofosbuvir 200 mg/velpatasvir 50 mg and sofosbuvir 150 mg/velpatasvir 37.5 mg) developed for use by younger children who cannot swallow tablets. The recommended dosage of Epclusa in children ages 3 years and older is based on weight.

Treatment with Epclusa for 12 weeks was approved in patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), and in combination with ribavirin (RBV) for patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or C). Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is the only protease inhibitor-free, pangenotypic HCV regimen approved for patients as young as 3 years of age.

In the United States, as of 2018 there were approximately 35,300 to 60,500 children living with HCV and incidence has been on the rise. Mother-to-child transmission, the most common cause of HCV infection in children, increased 161% from 2009 to 2017, with intravenous drug use representing the primary driver of HCV infection among women of childbearing age.

“Gilead remains steadfast in our commitment to supporting HCV elimination. Today’s decision by the FDA represents important progress toward that goal by expanding more cure options for children living with HCV,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “This approval adds to the robust clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of Epclusa across a broad set of patients, including those with end-stage renal disease and all stages of fibrosis.”

The approval of Epclusa for children as young as 3 years of age is based on data from a Phase 2, open-label clinical trial that enrolled 41 children 3 years to less than 6 years of age to be treated with Epclusa for 12 weeks. At 12 weeks after treatment completion, Epclusa achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR12) or cure rate of 83% (34/41) among all patients, 88% (28/32) in children with HCV genotype 1, 50% (3/6) in children with HCV genotype 2, and 100% in children with HCV genotype 3 (2/2) and HCV genotype 4 (1/1). Of the seven patients who did not achieve cure, all discontinued treatment within one to 20 days of starting treatment.

The safety profile of Epclusa in children 3 to less than 6 years of age treated was generally consistent with that observed in clinical trials in adults. Vomiting and product use issue (spitting up the drug) were reported in 15% and 10% of subjects, respectively; these adverse reactions were mild (Grade 1 or 2) and led to treatment discontinuation in 5 (12%) subjects.

Please see below for the U.S. Indication and Important Safety Information, including BOXED WARNING, for Epclusa.

“Treating pediatric HCV remains an important public health priority. The Phase 2 clinical trial results previously showed that this medication was effective in treating many HCV-infected patients, regardless of genotype,” said Karen Murray, MD, Chair of Cleveland Clinic Children’s and lead investigator of the pediatric study. “Now, the expanded approval and oral pellet formulation offer new treatment strategies in younger patients with HCV.”

<b>U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR THE USE OF EPCLUSA</b>

<b>BOXED WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN HCV/HBV COINFECTED PATIENTS</b>

<b>Test all patients for evidence of current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before initiating treatment with EPCLUSA. HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals (DAAs) and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive, in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV, and also in patients receiving certain immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV DAAs may be increased in patients taking these other agents. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.</b>

<b>Contraindications</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>If EPCLUSA is used in combination with ribavirin (RBV), all contraindications, warnings and precautions, in particular pregnancy avoidance, and adverse reactions to RBV also apply. Refer to RBV prescribing information.</li>
</ul>
<b>Warnings and Precautions</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone: </b>Amiodarone is not recommended for use with EPCLUSA due to the risk of symptomatic bradycardia, particularly in patients also taking beta blockers or with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or with advanced liver disease. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir containing regimen. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. Patients should seek immediate medical evaluation if they develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers and/or Moderate to Strong Inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 or CYP3A4:</b> Rifampin, St. John’s wort and carbamazepine are not recommended for use with EPCLUSA as they may significantly decrease sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir plasma concentrations.</li>
</ul>
<b>Adverse Reactions</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>The most common adverse reactions (=10%, all grades) with EPCLUSA in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older were headache and fatigue; and when used with RBV in adults with decompensated cirrhosis were fatigue, anemia, nausea, headache, insomnia and diarrhea. The most common adverse reactions (=10%, grade 1 or 2) in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age were vomiting and spitting up the drug.</li>
</ul>
<b>Drug Interactions</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Coadministration of EPCLUSA is not recommended with topotecan due to increased concentrations of topotecan.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Coadministration of EPCLUSA is not recommended with proton-pump inhibitors, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifapentine, efavirenz, and tipranavir/ritonavir due to decreased concentrations of sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir.</li>
</ul>
Consult the full Prescribing Information for EPCLUSA for more information on potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments.

<b>INDICATION</b>

EPCLUSA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis and in combination with ribavirin for those with decompensated cirrhosis.

<strong>About Plinabulin</strong>
Plinabulin, BeyondSpring’s lead drug, is a <em>selective immunomodulating microtubule-binding agent</em> (<em>SIMBA</em>). It is a novel, intravenous infused, patent-protected drug that is NDA filed for CIN prevention in the U.S. and China and has a fully enrolled pivotal Phase 3 anti-cancer study for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Plinabulin triggers the release of the immune defense protein, GEF-H1, which leads to two distinct effects: first is a durable anticancer benefit due to the maturation of dendritic cells resulting in the activation of tumor antigen-specific T-cells to target cancer cells, and the second is early-onset action in CIN prevention after chemotherapy by boosting the number of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Plinabulin received breakthrough designation from both U.S. and China FDA for CIN prevention indication. As a “pipeline in a drug,” plinabulin is being broadly studied in various immuno-oncology regimens to determine if it can boost the effects of the PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and re-sensitize PD-1/PD-L1 antibody resistant patients.

<strong>About Plinabulin CIN NDA Program</strong>
The Plinabulin and G-CSF combination NDA program is comprised of four studies: PROTECTIVE-1 Phase 2 and Phase 3 and PROTECTIVE-2 Phase 2 and Phase 3.
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>PROTECTIVE-1 Phase 2</strong> (4arm randomized study, NSCLC, docetaxel, n=55): Plinabulin single agent (5 mg/m2, 10 mg/m2, or 20 mg/m2, day 1 dose), pegfilgrastim (6 mg, day 2 dose). <strong>Plinabulin 20 mg/m2 was selected as the Phase 3 dose.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>PROTECTIVE-1 Phase 3</strong> (2 arm randomized, double-blind study, NSCLC, breast cancer, prostate cancer, docetaxel, n=105 patients): Plinabulin single agent (40 mg fixed dose – equivalent to 20 mg/m2, day 1 dose) vs. pegfilgrastim (6 mg, day 2 dose). Primary endpoint DSN cycle is met with non-inferiority. <strong>Plinabulin showed week 1 early onset of action and was effective in prevention of clinical outcomes, such as FN and hospitalization, and chemo dose reduction and delay.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>PROTECTIVE-2 Phase 2</strong> (7 arm randomized study, breast cancer, TAC, n=115 patients): Plinabulin single agent (10 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2, or 30 mg/m2, day 1 dose) – 20 mg/m2 selected; Plinabulin (20 mg/m2, day 1 dose) + pegfilgrastim (1.5 mg, 3 mg, or 6 mg, day 2 dose); pegfilgrastim (6 mg, dose 2 dose). <strong>Plinabulin (20 mg/m2) and pegfilgrastim (6 mg) was selected to be Phase 3 dose.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>PROTECTIVE-2 Phase 3</strong> (2 arm randomized, double-blind study, breast cancer, TAC, 221 patients – Pivotal study): Plinabulin (40 mg fixed dose – equivalent to 20 mg/m2, day 1 dose) + pegfilgratstim (6 mg, day 2 dose) vs. pegfilgrastim (6 mg, day 2 dose). <strong>The combination is superior to pegfilgrastim alone, which met primary endpoint of prevention of grade 4 neutropenia and key secondary endpoints, with superior benefit in reducing the incidence and severity of febrile neutropenia (FN) and hospitalization, with better quality-of-life (QoL)</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>About CIN</strong>

CIN remains a severely unmet medical need and is the primary cause for the 4D’s (Decrease, Delay, Discontinue dose and Downgrade regimen) that compromise carefully selected cancer treatment regimens. Treatment or prevention of CIN with G-CSF has been the standard of care since Neupogen® was approved in 1991. The main benefit of G-CSF treatment, however, is in Week 2 after chemotherapy. Week 1 after chemotherapy is considered the “neutropenia vulnerability gap” where over 75% of CIN-related clinical complications occur, including febrile neutropenia, infection, hospitalization and death. Plinabulin is the first drug seeking FDA approval that has the potential to fill this gap. Combining plinabulin and G-CSF may maximize the protection of patients for the full cycle of chemotherapy, as demonstrated in the PROTECTIVE-2 Phase 3 registration study.

Each year in the U.S., 110,000 patients receiving chemotherapy are hospitalized after developing CIN, a severe side effect that increases the risk of infection with fever (also called FN). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines expanded the use of prophylactic G-CSFs, including pegfilgrastim, from high-risk patients only (chemo FN rate &gt;20%), to include intermediate-risk patients (FN rate between 10-20%), to reduce the number of hospital/ER visits related to CIN. The revision of the NCCN guidelines effectively increases the addressable market of patients to approximately 467,500 cancer patients in the U.S. annually.

<b>About Ensifentrine</b>

Ensifentrine (RPL554) is an investigational, first-in-class, inhaled, dual inhibitor of the enzymes phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 (""PDE3"" and ""PDE4""). This dual inhibition enables it to combine both bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effects in one compound. Ensifentrine also activates the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (""CFTR""), which is beneficial in reducing mucous viscosity and improving mucociliary clearance. Ensifentrine's mechanism of action has the potential to alleviate respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness and cough and work against inflammation associated with COPD or inflammation triggered by viruses.

Ensifentrine has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both lung function and symptoms, including breathlessness, in Verona Pharma's Phase 2 clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (""COPD""). In addition, nebulized ensifentrine showed further improved lung function and reduced lung volumes in COPD patients taking standard short- and long-acting bronchodilator therapy, including maximum bronchodilator treatment with dual/triple therapy. Ensifentrine has been well tolerated in clinical trials involving more than 1,300 subjects to date.

<b>About Verona Pharma</b>

Verona Pharma is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for the treatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs. If successfully developed and approved, Verona Pharma's product candidate, ensifentrine, has the potential to be the first therapy for the treatment of respiratory diseases that combines bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory activities in one compound. The Company is evaluating nebulized ensifentrine in its Phase 3 clinical program ENHANCE (""Ensifentrine as a Novel inHAled Nebulized COPD thErapy"") for COPD maintenance treatment. Two additional formulations of ensifentrine are in Phase 2 development for the treatment of COPD: dry powder inhaler (""DPI"") and pressurized metered-dose inhaler (""pMDI""). Ensifentrine has potential applications in cystic fibrosis, asthma and other respiratory diseases.

Basel, 11 June 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced new interim data from two studies of Evrysdi® (risdiplam); JEWELFISH and RAINBOWFISH. Data from JEWELFISH, an ongoing open-label study primarily evaluating the safety of Evrysdi in people aged 1 to 60 years who have been previously treated with another SMA-targeting therapy, including nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec, showed the safety profile of Evrysdi and increase in SMN protein levels are consistent with those observed in other Evrysdi studies.

Interim exploratory efficacy data from JEWELFISH also suggest stabilization in motor function at one year of treatment as measured by change from baseline in motor function measure (MFM 32). A recent survey from SMA Europe showed that almost 97% of people living with SMA reported disease stabilisation as progress.

Preliminary efficacy data from RAINBOWFISH, an ongoing open label study evaluating Evrysdi in babies from birth to six weeks with pre-symptomatic SMA, showed that infants treated for 12 months achieved age appropriate motor milestones, including sitting, standing and walking, and improvements in motor function. These data will be presented at the 2021 Virtual SMA Research &amp; Clinical Care Meeting from June 9-11 2021.

“These data from JEWELFISH add to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of Evrysdi in patients from one to 60 years of age,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph. D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Moreover, the early findings from RAINBOWFISH in pre-symptomatic babies under two months old are very encouraging. Altogether, we are hopeful that Evrysdi will continue to help address unmet treatment needs of the diverse SMA community.”

The JEWELFISH study enrolled the broadest patient population ever studied in an SMA trial, including patients with SMA Types 1-3 who received prior treatment across a wide range of age and disease severities.

Of the 174 people enrolled, 30% were teenagers and 35% adults, 62% had a HFMSE* score of less than 10 at baseline, 80% had scoliosis and 47% had undergone scoliosis surgery. Seventy-six people had previously been treated with nusinersen and 14 with onasemnogene abeparvovec. Evrysdi led to a sustained &gt;2-fold increase in median SMN protein levels versus baseline in all patients who received prior treatment, irrespective of which treatment was previously received or SMA type.

The overall AE profile of Evrysdi treatment in pre-treated patients was consistent with that of treatment-naïve patients in FIREFISH and SUNFISH. The most common adverse events in all patients were upper respiratory tract infection (17%), pyrexia (17%), headache (16%), nausea (12%), diarrhea (11%), nasopharyngitis (10%) and vomiting (8%). The most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (2%) lower respiratory tract infection (2%), upper respiratory tract infection (2%) and respiratory failure (2%). There were no treatment-related adverse events leading to withdrawal or treatment discontinuation in JEWELFISH, with some patients receiving treatment for more than three years. The study is ongoing and the primary analysis will be conducted at month 24.

“Data from the JEWELFISH study, which included a diverse patient population with a high degree of motor impairment, show that Evrysdi has a favourable safety profile in patients previously treated with an SMA-targeting therapy,” said Dr Claudia Chiriboga, Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA. “Importantly, the data also suggest a stabilisation of motor function in trial participants. As a progressive disease, untreated patients with SMA typically show a decline in motor function over time.”

Roche also presented preliminary efficacy data from RAINBOWFISH, which showed that of the five babies treated with Evrysdi for at least 12 months, all achieved sitting without support, rolling and crawling. Of the five, two had two SMN copies and three had &gt;2 copies. Four of the infants were able to stand unaided and walk independently. In addition, four babies reached a maximum score of 64 on the CHOP-INTEND** scale, and one scored 63. Data on the primary endpoint, the number of infants sitting without support for at least five seconds, will be reported when all primary analysis patients have reached one year of treatment. Recruitment for RAINBOWFISH is ongoing.

The most common adverse events were nasal congestion (33%), cough (25%), teething (25%), vomiting (25%), eczema (17%), abdominal pain (17%), diarrhea (17%), gastroenteritis (17%), papule (rash; 17%) and pyrexia (fever; 17%). There were no adverse events leading to withdrawal or study discontinuation.

Roche leads the clinical development of Evrysdi as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.

<strong>About </strong><strong>Evrysdi</strong><strong>® (</strong><strong>risdiplam</strong><strong>)</strong>
Evrysdi is a survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Evrysdi is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or by feeding tube.

Evrysdi is designed to treat SMA by increasing and sustaining the production of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement.

Evrysdi was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in 2017. Evrysdi has been approved in 44 countries and submitted in a further 32 countries.

Evrysdi is currently being evaluated in four multicentre trials in people with SMA:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>FIREFISH (NCT02913482) – an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants with the primary objective of assessing the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determining the dose for Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated for 2 years, followed by an open-label extension. Enrolment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 was to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds). The study met its primary endpoint.</li>
 	<li>SUNFISH (NCT02908685) – SUNFISH is a two part, double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal study in people aged 2-25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 (n=51) determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. Part 2 (n=180) evaluated motor function using the total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. MFM-32 is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. The study met its primary endpoint.</li>
 	<li>JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) – an open-label exploratory trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years (inclusion criteria) who received other investigational or approved SMA therapies for at least 90 days prior to receiving Evrysdi. The study has completed recruitment (n=174).</li>
 	<li>RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) – an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study, investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in babies (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.</li>

<strong>About SMA</strong>
SMA is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It affects approximately one in 10,000 babies and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by a mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leads to a deficiency of SMN protein. This protein is found throughout the body and is essential to the function of nerves that control muscles and movement. Without it, nerve cells cannot function correctly, leading to muscle weakness over time. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., June 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced results from a four-year follow-up analysis of the Phase 3 CLL14 trial, which showed that previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with coexisting conditions who were treated with VENCLYXTO®/VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) plus obinutuzumab continued to show longer progression-free survival (PFS) and higher rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) compared to patients receiving a standard of care chemoimmunotherapy regimen of obinutuzumab and chlorambucil. The data were presented for the first time today during the virtual 26th European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress (abstract #S146).

“The CLL14 trial results observed after four years of follow-up with treatment of venetoclax plus obinutuzumab show that these patients can experience long-lasting responses without disease progression, years after stopping treatment,” said Mohamed Zaki, M.D., Ph.D., vice president and head, global oncology development, AbbVie.

After a median follow-up of more than four years (52.4 months), patients treated with the VENCLYXTO/VENCLEXTA and obinutuzumab combination (n=216) continued to demonstrate longer PFS compared to patients on treatment with obinutuzumab and chlorambucil, the risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 67 percent (n=216; median not reached compared to 36.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.33 [95% CI 0.25-0.45]); results are descriptive. At four years after randomization, the PFS rate for patients treated with the VENCLYXTO/VENCLEXTA-based combination was 74 percent compared to 35.4 percent for patients treated with obinutuzumab and chlorambucil. The improvement in PFS was observed across all clinical and biological risk groups, including patients with TP53 mutation, 17p deletion and unmutated IGHV status.1

Additionally, assessment of MRD in peripheral blood 30 months after the end of treatment showed that 26.9 percent of patients treated with the VENCLYXTO/VENCLEXTA-based combination still had undetectable MRD (<10-4) compared to 3.2 percent of patients in the obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil arm.1 Undetectable MRD occurs when less than one CLL cell per 10,000 lymphocytes can be detected in the blood or bone marrow using sensitive analytical methods.2 

No new safety signals were observed in the four-year follow-up analysis.1  The most frequently occurring serious adverse reactions (>=2%) in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab were pneumonia, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, and TLS.3

“CLL is considered an incurable disease and becomes more difficult to treat each time a patient experiences a relapse, so a key treatment goal is to maintain remission for as long as possible. The four- year results of the CLL14 study show that 74 percent of patients treated with fixed-duration venetoclax-obinutuzumab remain without PFS event, more than three years after treatment cessation,” said Othman Al-Sawaf, M.D., lead investigator of the CLL14 study, hematologist-oncologist at the University Hospital Cologne in Germany, and study physician at the German CLL Study Group. “This highlights how durable the remissions are after 12 treatment cycles in the vast majority of patients, suggesting the venetoclax-obinutuzumab combination regimen as an effective option for patients with previously untreated CLL.”

CLL is a slow-growing form of leukemia, or blood cancer, in which too many immature lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) are found predominantly in the blood and bone marrow. CLL is the most common form of leukemia in the Western Hemisphere, accounting for approximately one third of new leukemia diagnoses and nearly 95,000 new cases in Europe each year.4,5,6 

VENCLYXTO/VENCLEXTA is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S.

About the CLL14 Phase 3 Trial3,7,8
The prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized Phase 3 CLL14 trial, which was conducted in close collaboration with the German CLL Study Group (DCLLSG), evaluated the efficacy and safety of a combined regimen of VENCLYXTO/VENCLEXTA and obinutuzumab (n=216) versus obinutuzumab and chlorambucil (n=216) in previously untreated patients with CLL and coexisting medical conditions (total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS] score >6 or creatinine clearance <70 mL/min). The therapies were administered for a fixed duration of 12 months for VENCLYXTO/VENCLEXTA in combination with six cycles of obinutuzumab. The trial enrolled 432 patients, all of whom were previously untreated according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria. Efficacy was based on PFS as assessed by an independent review committee.

Key secondary endpoints were rates of MRD in peripheral blood and bone marrow, overall and complete response rates, MRD in complete response in peripheral blood and bone marrow, and overall survival.

The four-year, follow-up analysis showed an OS rate of 85.4% with Ven-Obi versus 83.1% with chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab (Obi-Clb; HR 0.85, 95% CI [0.54-1.35]; P=0.49).

In patients with CLL receiving combination therapy with obinutuzumab, serious adverse reactions (ARs) were most often due to febrile neutropenia and pneumonia (5 percent each). The most common ARs (=20 percent) of any grade were neutropenia (60 percent), diarrhea (28 percent), and fatigue (21 percent). Fatal ARs that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 28 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2 percent (4/212) of patients, most often from infection.

About VENCLYXTO® (venetoclax) 

VENCLYXTO® (venetoclax) is a first-in-class medicine that selectively binds and inhibits the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers, BCL-2 prevents cancer cells from undergoing their natural death or self-destruction process, called apoptosis. VENCLYXTO targets the BCL-2 protein and works to help restore the process of apoptosis.

VENCLYXTO is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. Together, the companies are committed to BCL-2 research and to studying venetoclax in clinical trials across several blood and other cancers. Venetoclax is approved in more than 80 countries, including the U.S.

Indication and Important VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) EU Safety Information3

Indications

Venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).

Venclyxto in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.

Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL:

In the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor, or
In the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.
Venclyxto in combination with a hypomethylating agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is contraindicated. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors at initiation and during the dose-titration phase due to increased risk for tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). Concomitant use of preparations containing St. John’s wort as Venclyxto efficacy may be reduced.

Special Warnings & Precautions for Use

Tumour Lysis syndrome, including fatal events, has occurred in patients when treated with Venclyxto. For CLL and AML, please refer to the indication-specific recommendations for prevention of TLS in the Venclyxto summary of product characteristic (SmPC).

Patients should be assessed for risk and should receive appropriate prophylaxis, monitoring, and management for TLS. The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including comorbidities. Venclyxto poses a risk for TLS at initiation and during the dose-titration phase. Changes in electrolytes consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of Venclyxto and at each dose increase.

Neutropenia (grade 3 or 4) has been reported. Complete blood counts should be monitored throughout the treatment period.

In patients with AML, neutropenia (grade 3 or 4) is common before starting treatment. The neutrophil counts can worsen with Venetoclax in combination with a hypomethylating agent. Neutropenia can recur with subsequent cycles of therapy. Dose modification and interruptions for cytopenias are dependent on remission status.

For CLL and AML, please refer to the indication-specific recommendations for dose modifications for toxicities in the Venclyxto SmPC.

Serious infections including sepsis with fatal outcome have been reported. Monitoring of any signs and symptoms of infection is required. Suspected infections should receive prompt treatment including antimicrobials and dose interruption or reduction as appropriate.

Live vaccines should not be administered during treatment or thereafter until B-cell recovery.

Drug Interactions

In CLL and AML CYP3A inhibitors may increase Venclyxto plasma concentrations.

In CLL, at initiation and dose-titration phase, Strong CYP3A inhibitors are contraindicated due to increased risk for TLS and moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If moderate CYP3A inhibitors must be used, please refer to the recommendations for dose modifications in the Venclyxto SmPC.

In AML, please refer to the AML-specific recommendation for dose modifications for potential interactions with CYP3A inhibitors, in the VENCLYXTO SmPC.

Avoid concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors at initiation and during the dose titration phase.

CYP3A4 inducers may decrease Venclyxto plasma concentrations.  Avoid coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. These agents may decrease venetoclax plasma concentrations.

Co-administration of bile acid sequestrants with VENCLYXTO is not recommended as this may reduce the absorption of VENCLYXTO.

Adverse Reactions

CLL

The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (>=20%) of any grade in patients receiving venetoclax in the combination studies with obinutuzumab or rituximab were neutropenia, diarrhoea, and upper respiratory tract infection. In the monotherapy studies, the most common adverse reactions were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection.

The most frequently occurring serious adverse reactions (>=2%) in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab were pneumonia, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, and TLS.  In the monotherapy studies, the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (>=2%) were pneumonia and febrile neutropenia.

Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients treated with venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab in the CLL14 and Murano studies, respectively.  In the monotherapy studies with venetoclax, 11% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions.

Dosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with the combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab in CLL14, in 15% of patients treated with the combination of venetoclax and rituximab in Murano, and in 14% of patients treated with venetoclax in the monotherapy studies. The most common adverse reaction that led to dose interruptions was neutropenia.

AML

The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (>=20%) of any grade in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with azacitidine or decitabine in the VIALE-A and M14-358, respectively, were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, anaemia, fatigue, pneumonia, hypokalaemia, and decreased appetite, haemorrhage, dizziness/syncope, hypotension, headache, abdominal pain, and anaemia.

The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (=5%) in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with azacitidine were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, sepsis and haemorrhage. In M14-358, the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (=5%) were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, bacteraemia and sepsis.

Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 24% of patients treated with venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in the VIALE-A study, and 26% of patients treated with venetoclax in combination with decitabine in the M14-358 study, respectively.

Dosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients in VIALE-A, and in 6% of patients in M14-358. Venetoclax dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 72% and 65% of patients, respectively. The most common adverse reaction that led to dose interruption (>10%) of Venetoclax in VIALE-A, were febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, and thrombocytopenia.  The most common adverse reactions that led to dose interruption (=5%) of venetoclax in M14-358 were febrile neutropenia, neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, pneumonia, platelet count decreased, and white blood cell count decreased.

Special Populations

Patients with reduced renal function (CrCl <80 mL/min) may require more intensive prophylaxis and monitoring to reduce the risk of TLS at initiation and during the dose-titration phase.  Safety in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) or on dialysis has not been established, and a recommended dose for these patients has not been determined.

For patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, a dose reduction of at least 50% throughout treatment is recommended.

Venclyxto may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise nursing women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment.

BOSTON &amp; ZUG, Switzerland &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq:VRTX) and CRISPR Therapeutics (Nasdaq:CRSP) today announced new data on 22 patients,<b> </b>with follow-up of at least 3 months, and ranging from 4 months to 26 months, treated with the investigational CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing therapy, CTX001, that show a consistent and sustained response to treatment. CTX001 is being investigated in two ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials as a potential one-time therapy for patients suffering from transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) and severe sickle cell disease (SCD). In total, more than 40 patients have been dosed across both studies to date.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

All 15 patients with TDT, including six who have the beta zero/beta zero or other severe genotypes, were transfusion-free at last follow-up, and all seven patients with severe SCD were free of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) from CTX001 infusion through last follow-up. Five patients with TDT and two patients with SCD now have follow-up of greater than one year, demonstrating a stable and durable response to treatment. These data are available as e-posters beginning on June 11, 2021, at 09:00 CEST, and a partial presentation of these data were presented during the Joint EHA-ASH Symposium on June 10, 2021 from 17:30-18:30 CEST. A summary of the results from the CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121 Phase 1/2 clinical trials is provided below.

“The data presented today in 22 patients are impressive in both the consistency and durability of effect. These results add to the growing body of evidence that CTX001 may hold the promise for a one-time functional cure for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We are working with urgency to complete enrollment and look forward to finalizing regulatory discussions and moving towards filing,” said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President at Vertex.

“The continued progress and momentum of CTX001 validate the role that CRISPR gene-editing technology could have in the future of therapeutics,” added Samarth Kulkarni, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at CRISPR Therapeutics. “We are excited about these results and look forward to additional longer-term data and to moving this investigational medicine forward for a larger population of patients with these two devastating diseases.”

“As a physician caring for patients suffering from beta thalassemia, I have a high sense of urgency for novel and efficacious treatments,” said Dr. Franco Locatelli, Professor of Pediatrics at the Sapienza University of Rome, Director of the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology at Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital. “These results suggest the potential for a durable benefit for patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.”

“It is thrilling to work on a groundbreaking program like CTX001,” said Dr. Stephan Grupp, Section Chief, Cellular Therapy and Transplant, Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. “This approach uses CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to enable the patient’s own cells to produce fetal hemoglobin, and to see results that demonstrate the potential for a treatment that may transform the lives of many patients is an exciting time for me and the team.”

<b>CLIMB-111 Trial in TDT: Updated Results
</b>The 15 patients with TDT reported at EHA are patients who had reached at least three months of follow-up after CTX001 dosing and therefore could be assessed for initial safety and efficacy. All 15 patients showed a similar pattern of response, with rapid and sustained increases in total hemoglobin, fetal hemoglobin and transfusion independence.

All 15 patients were transfusion independent with follow-up ranging from 4 to 26 months after CTX001 infusion and had clinically meaningful improvements in total hemoglobin from 8.9 to 16.9 g/dL and fetal hemoglobin from 67.3% to 99.6% at last visit.

Bone marrow allelic editing data collected from 10 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, of which five patients had at least 12 months of follow-up and one patient had at least 24 months of follow-up, demonstrated a durable effect.

The safety data from all 15 patients were generally consistent with an autologous stem cell transplant and myeloablative conditioning. As previously reported, there were four serious adverse events (SAEs) considered related or possibly related to CTX001 reported in one patient: headache, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), acute respiratory distress syndrome and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. All four SAEs occurred in the context of HLH and have resolved. The majority of non-serious adverse events were considered mild to moderate.

The presentations at EHA and the data summarized in this press release cover all TDT patients dosed with CTX001 with three or more months of follow-up as of the data cut on March 30, 2021. In addition to the data presented above, a TDT patient, with less than three months of follow-up and therefore not included in the data cut, experienced an SAE; this SAE of cerebellar hemorrhage, which was considered related to busulfan conditioning, has resolved.

Enrollment and dosing are ongoing.

<b>CLIMB-121 Trial in Severe SCD: Updated Results
</b>The seven patients reported at EHA are patients who had reached at least three months of follow-up after CTX001 dosing and therefore could be assessed for initial safety and efficacy. All seven patients showed a similar pattern of response, with rapid and sustained increases in total hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin, as well as elimination of VOCs.

All seven patients remained VOC-free with follow-up ranging from five to 22 months after CTX001 infusion and had clinically meaningful improvements in total hemoglobin from 11 to 15.9 g/dL and fetal hemoglobin levels from 39.6% to 49.6% at last visit.

Bone marrow allelic editing data collected from four patients who have at least six months of follow-up, of which two had 12 months of follow-up, demonstrated a durable effect.

The safety data from all seven patients were generally consistent with an autologous stem cell transplant and myeloablative conditioning. There were no SAEs considered related to CTX001, and the majority of non-serious adverse events were considered mild to moderate.

Enrollment and dosing are ongoing.

<b>About CTX001
</b>CTX001 is an investigational, autologous, <i>ex vivo</i> CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is being evaluated for patients suffering from TDT or severe SCD, in which a patient’s hematopoietic stem cells are edited to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is a form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present at birth, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin. The elevation of HbF by CTX001 has the potential to alleviate or eliminate transfusion requirements for patients with TDT and reduce or eliminate painful and debilitating sickle crises for patients with SCD. Earlier results from these ongoing trials were published as a Brief Report in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> in January of 2021.

Based on progress in this program to date, CTX001 has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both TDT and SCD. CTX001 has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation from the European Commission, as well as Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for both TDT and SCD.

Among gene-editing approaches being investigated/evaluated for TDT and SCD, CTX001 is the furthest advanced in clinical development.

<b>About CLIMB-111
</b>The ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label trial, CLIMB-Thal-111, is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CTX001 in patients ages 12 to 35 with TDT. The trial will enroll up to 45 patients and follow patients for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in a long-term follow-up trial.

<b>About CLIMB-121
</b>The ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label trial, CLIMB-SCD-121, is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CTX001 in patients ages 12 to 35 with severe SCD. The trial will enroll up to 45 patients and follow patients for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in a long-term follow-up trial.

<b>About CLIMB-131
</b>This is a long-term, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CTX001 in patients who received CTX001 in CLIMB-111 or CLIMB-121. The trial is designed to follow participants for up to 15 years after CTX001 infusion.

<b>About the Gene-Editing Process in These Trials
</b>Patients who enroll in these trials will have their own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells collected from peripheral blood. The patient’s cells will be edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The edited cells, CTX001, will then be infused back into the patient as part of a stem cell transplant, a process which involves, among other things, a patient being treated with myeloablative busulfan conditioning. Patients undergoing stem cell transplants may also encounter side effects (ranging from mild to severe) that are unrelated to the administration of CTX001. Patients will initially be monitored to determine when the edited cells begin to produce mature blood cells, a process known as engraftment. After engraftment, patients will continue to be monitored to track the impact of CTX001 on multiple measures of disease and for safety.

<b>About the Vertex-CRISPR Collaboration
</b>Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics entered into a strategic research collaboration in 2015 focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. CTX001 represents the first potential treatment to emerge from the joint research program. Under a recently amended collaboration agreement, Vertex will lead global development, manufacturing and commercialization of CTX001 and split program costs and profits worldwide 60/40 with CRISPR Therapeutics.

<p align=""justify""><strong>PARIS – June </strong><strong>11</strong><strong>, 2021 </strong>– Results from Part A of CADENZA, a pivotal Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of sutimlimab in people with cold agglutinin disease (CAD) without a recent history of blood transfusion (within the prior six months), will be presented in an oral session at the European Hematology Association 2021 Congress. The data demonstrated treatment with sutimlimab resulted in rapid and sustained inhibition of C1-activated hemolysis in people with CAD, noted within one week of treatment, and clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin and fatigue when compared to placebo during the course of the study.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“</em><em>Cold agglutinin disease causes the body’s immune system to mistakenly destroy its healthy red blood cells. </em><em>P</em><em>eople living with cold agglutin</em><em>in</em><em> disease experience the crippling impact of chronic hemolysis that can cause severe anemia, profound fatigue and can have acute hemolytic crisis,” said principal investigator and presenting author </em><em>Professor </em><em>Alexander Röth, M.D., Department of Hematology</em><em> and Stem Cell Transplantation</em><em>, University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. “The positive evidence from the CADENZA trial demonstrate significant improvements in hemolysis and </em><em>meaningful</em> <em>impact on key measures of anemia and fatigue.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">CADENZA is a second pivotal Phase 3 study investigating sutimlimab in the treatment of CAD. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients who met all three of the following components: improvement in hemoglobin =1.5 g/dL from baseline at treatment assessment timepoint, (average of Weeks 23, 25, and 26); avoidance of transfusions from Week 5 through Week 26; and avoidance of other CAD-related therapies beyond what was permitted from Week 5 through Week 26. The secondary efficacy measures assessed improvement from baseline in key indicators of the disease process including hemoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and quality of life as measured by Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“The results from CADENZA </em><em>and data</em><em> from the Phase 3 CARDINAL study,</em><em> presented </em><em>as a late-breaker at the American</em><em> Society of Hematology</em><em> congress in 2019</em><em>, will be the basis of our filing with the E</em><em>uropean Medicines Agency</em><em>.</em><em> T</em><em>ogether</em><em>,</em> <em>the</em><em> studies</em> <em>highlight the promis</em><em>ing</em> <em>potential </em><em>of sutimlimab</em><em> to </em><em>have a </em><em>meaningful impact </em><em>for </em><em>p</em><em>eople</em><em> living with CAD,” </em><em>said </em><em>Karin Knobe</em><em>,</em><em> M</em><em>.D., Ph.D.,</em> <em>Head of Development, Rare and Rare Blood Disorders, Sanofi.</em> <em>“Based on the </em><em>robust clinical </em><em>evidence we have to-date</em><em>,</em> <em>sutimlimab </em><em>significantly inhibits</em><em> hemolysis and has </em><em>the potential to be an important new treatment </em><em>for CAD</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></p>
<strong>CADENZA Phase 3 study data (final Part A) presented at EHA</strong> <strong>2021</strong>
<p align=""justify"">The CADENZA trial is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of sutimlimab in patients with CAD without a recent history of blood transfusion (within the past 6 months). Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a fixed weight-based dose (6.5g or 7.5g) of sutimlimab or placebo via intravenous infusion on Day 0, Day 7 and then once every other week up to Week 26. The open-label Part B of the study is ongoing and will evaluate long-term safety as well as durability of response to sutimlimab in all participants with CAD.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Forty-two patients (mean age of 66.7 years) were enrolled and randomized to either sutimlimab (N=22) or placebo (N=20). Overall, 19 (86%) and 20 (100%) patients in the sutimlimab and placebo groups, respectively, completed Part A and continued into Part B. Three (14%) patients from the sutimlimab group discontinued Part A early due to adverse events.</p>

 	<li>Seventy-three percent (n=16) of patients treated with sutimlimab met the primary composite endpoint, demonstrating improvement in hemoglobin =1.5 g/dL from baseline at treatment assessment timepoint (Weeks 23, 25, and 26); avoidance of transfusions from Week 5 through Week 26; and avoidance of other CAD-related therapies beyond what was permitted from Week 5 through Week 26 compared to 15% (n=3) in the placebo group (Odds Ratio=15.9, 95% CI: 2.9 to 88.0, p&lt;0.001).</li>
 	<li>Data showed sutimlimab increased and sustained mean hemoglobin levels from baseline to treatment assessment timepoint (Week 26) representing a statistically significant least squares (LS) mean difference of 2.6 g/dL (p&lt;0.001; 95% CI:1.8 to 3.4) when compared with placebo. Hemoglobin improved rapidly, with a LS mean increase from baseline of =1 g/dL by Week 1 and =2 g/dL by Week 3. Overall mean hemoglobin levels were maintained &gt;11 g/dL from Week 3 through treatment assessment timepoint, demonstrating a sustained effect throughout the remainder of the treatment period.</li>
 	<li>A statistically significant improvement in fatigue as measured by FACIT-Fatigue assessment was achieved in patients treated with sutimlimab when compared to the placebo group, 10.8 points versus 1.9, respectively, with a LS mean difference of 8.9 points (p&lt;0.001; 95% CI:4.0 to 13.9). A 5 or greater point increase in FACIT-Fatigue score suggests a clinically important change.<sup> 1</sup></li>
 	<li>Patients treated with sutimlimab had greater mean reductions in bilirubin, a key marker of hemolysis, from baseline to treatment assessment timepoint as compared with the placebo group (-22.1 µmol/L versus -1.8 µmol/L, respectively). Mean bilirubin levels were normalized below the upper limit of normal within 1 to 3 weeks in the sutimlimab group (upper limit of reference range 20.5 µmol/L) and maintained levels below the upper limit of normal to week 26.</li>
 	<li>Treatment with sutimlimab led to meaningful improvements in LDH, an additional hemolysis marker, from baseline to treatment assessment timepoint compared to placebo ( -150.8 U/L versus +7.6 U/L).</li>
 	<li>Twenty-one patients (95.5%) in the sutimlimab group and 20 patients (100%) in the placebo group experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE).</li>
 	<li>Three patients (13.6%) in the sutimlimab group experienced at least one treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE) (n=4), including one TESAE assessed by the investigator as related to sutimlimab (cerebral venous thrombosis in a patient with a history of diabetes). One patient (5%) in the placebo group had three TESAEs.</li>
 	<li>Treatment emergent adverse events reported more often in the sutimlimab group vs. placebo (difference of = 3 patients between groups) were: headache (23% versus 10%), hypertension (23% versus 0%), rhinitis (18% versus 0%), Raynaud’s phenomenon (18% versus 0%), and acrocyanosis (14% versus 0%). No deaths or meningococcal infections were reported.</li>

<p align=""justify""><strong>Cold agglutinin disease</strong><strong>, a rare</strong><strong> and chronic condition</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare, chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia that causes the body’s immune system to mistakenly attack healthy red blood cells and cause their destruction (hemolysis) via activation of the classical complement pathway. CAD patients may experience chronic anemia, profound fatigue, acute hemolytic crisis, and other potential complications, including an increased risk of thromboembolic events and early death.<sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>4</sup> CAD impacts the lives of an estimated 12,000 people in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.<sup>5</sup> Currently there are no approved therapies for CAD.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About CARDINAL Phase 3 Study</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">CARDINAL was the first of two pivotal Phase 3 studies investigating sutimlimab as a potential treatment for CAD. CARDINAL is an open-label, single-arm study to assess the efficacy and safety of sutimlimab in adult patients with CAD who received a recent blood transfusion.

<p align=""justify""><strong>About Sutimlimab</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Sutimlimab is an investigational, humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to selectively target and inhibit C1s in the classical complement pathway, which is part of the innate immune system. By blocking C1s, sutimlimab inhibits the activation of the classical complement pathway with the goal of halting C1-activated hemolysis in CAD to prevent the abnormal destruction of healthy red blood cells. By selectively inhibiting the classical pathway upstream at C1s, sutimlimab does not inhibit the lectin and alternative complement pathways.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Sutimlimab has been granted Breakthrough Therapy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Orphan Drug status by the FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan. Sutimlimab is currently under clinical investigation and has not been approved by any regulatory authority. Sanofi plans to resubmit its Biologics License Application with the U.S FDA in the second half of 2021.</p>

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

INCHEON, South Korea--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Celltrion Healthcare today presented new data from its post-approval study evaluating the real-world clinical effectiveness and safety of Truxima<sup>®</sup> (biosimilar rituximab, CT-P10) in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) at the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2021 Virtual Congress.<sup>1</sup>

CT-P10 was granted European Medicines Agency approval in 2017 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and specific blood cancers, including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).<sup>2</sup> DLBCL is the most common subtype of NHL, representing an estimated 30-40% of adult cases.<sup>3,4,5,6</sup>

This non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS) involved the collection of patient-level data from hospital medical records for patients with DLBCL who received CT-P10 treatment in five European countries (United Kingdom, Spain, France, Germany and Italy). CT-P10 treatment pattern data were collected retrospectively during the 30-month observation period and patients were selected based on the treatment they received as part of their standard clinical care in a real-world setting.

The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and summary of best responses and secondary endpoints included safety profile and CT-P10 treatment pathways. At 30-months post-index, amongst patients taking first-line CT-P10, 67% (95% confidence interval [CI] 61.3–72.1) had not experienced disease progression, with 74% (95% CI 69.2–79.1) overall survival.<b> </b>Of the 382 patients observed, over three quarters initiated on CT-P10 achieved complete or partial response by 30 months, with 82% having recorded a complete response (n=312). Partial response was seen in 12% (n=46), no response or stable disease in 4% (n=16) and progressive disease in 2% (n=8).

CT-P10 also appeared to be generally well tolerated by patients, with adverse events (AEs) consistent with those reported for reference rituximab. Overall, 90% (n=351) of patients reported at least one AE (total AEs n=2,504); 65% (n=253) experienced a grade 3 or higher AE, and 28% (n=109) were recorded as definitely, probably, or possibly related to CT-P10.

“This is the first multi-country retrospective post-approval study to investigate the effectiveness and safety of CT-P10 treatment in patients with DLBCL in a real-world setting across Europe,” said Dr. Mark Bishton, Consultant Haematologist and Honorary Clinical Associate Professor at the University of Nottingham, School of Medicine. “Over three quarters of patients initiated on CT-P10 achieved complete or partial response by 30 months. The response rates, survival rates and overall safety profile for CT-P10 appears consistent with those reported for reference rituximab, which could support the use of CT-P10 in combination with chemotherapy as a therapeutic option for DLBCL.”

Celltrion Healthcare also presented real-world data on rapid infusion of CT-P10 in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) at the EHA Updates-in-Hematology.<sup>7</sup> The study was the first multi-country study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of rapid infusion of CT-P10 in a real-world setting. Safety results suggest that rapid infusion of CT-P10 was generally well tolerated, with only 10% (n=20; 95% CI: 6 – 15%) of patients experiencing an infusion-related reaction (IRR). The majority of IRRs were grade 1 or 2 (96%), with the most common IRR being fatigue (35% n=7/20 of the patients with index IRRs), followed by nausea (30% n=6/20) and vomiting (15% n=3/20). In terms of response, the majority of patients achieved a complete response (74% n=142/192) or partial response (22% n=42/192) over the 6-month observation period.

“The recommended protocol for rituximab infusion in Europe is a slow initial infusion rate with a gradual upward titration. Rapid infusion is often used in subsequent infusions for patients who had no serious complications related to the first infusion,” said Dr. HoUng Kim, Ph.D., Head of Medical and Marketing Division at Celltrion Healthcare. “We are encouraged by the results of the study as Truxima has demonstrated a similar IRR rate to reference rituximab. This will allow informed, evidence-based decisions on cost-effective treatment strategy for patients with CLL or NHL.”

<b>Notes to Editors:</b>

<b>About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)<sup>3,4,5,6</sup></b>

There are more than 60 different subtypes of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), however diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are the most common subtype accounting for 30-40% of adult NHLs. Global epidemiological data is limited, however it is thought that the incidence is 7 cases per 100,000 people.

DLBCL is an aggressive condition and it is common to find patients with advanced disease at the point of diagnosis. The most commonly exhibited symptom is one or more painless swellings, and other general symptoms include heavy sweating at night, high temperatures that arise with no obvious cause and weight loss. Of DLBCL patients, 30-40% are thought to relapse and 10% of patients have refractory disease. Patients with relapsed refractory DLBCL if left untreated have a life expectancy of 3 to 4 months.

<b>About Truxima<sup>®</sup> (biosimilar rituximab)<sup>8,9</sup></b>

Truxima<sup>®</sup> is a mAb that targets CD20, a transmembrane protein found on the surface of most B-cells. By binding specifically to CD20, Truxima<sup>®</sup> depletes B-cells by three main mechanisms: induction of apoptosis, stimulation of CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity) and stimulation of ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity). Truxima<sup>®</sup> is approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis. Truxima<sup>®</sup> is the first rituximab similar biotherapeutic product to be prequalified by the World Health Organization (May 2020).

<span class=""xn-location"">RARITAN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 12, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced overall survival (OS) results from the Phase 3 MAIA (NCT02252172) study showing the addition of DARZALEX<sup>® </sup>(daratumumab) to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd) resulted in a statistically significant survival benefit over lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) alone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who were ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and were treated to progression.<sup>1</sup> These data were featured in the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2021 Virtual Press Briefing and will be presented as a late-breaking abstract during the EHA Virtual Congress (Abstract #LB1901).

The prespecified interim analysis for OS found that after a median follow-up of nearly five years (56.2 months), a 32 percent reduction in the risk of death was observed in the D-Rd treatment arm vs. Rd arm.<sup>1</sup> Median OS was not reached in either arm [hazard ratio (HR): 0.68, 95 percent confidence interval (CI), 0.53-0.86; <i>p</i>=0.0013].<sup>1</sup> Median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached after nearly five years and the PFS benefit observed with D-Rd was maintained, with a 47 percent reduction in risk of disease progression or death [HR: 0.53; 95 percent CI, 0.43-0.66; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001].<sup>1</sup> These data are expected to form the basis of future regulatory submissions.

""The treatment of multiple myeloma becomes more complex with each relapse. Therefore, it is critical to achieve deep treatment responses and improved survival with frontline therapy,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Thierry Facon</span>, M.D.*, Professor of Haematology at Lille University Hospital, <span class=""xn-location"">Lille, France</span> and study investigator. ""These results strongly support the use of daratumumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone as a new standard of care to extend survival and improve clinical outcomes in transplant ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.""

All patients enrolled in the MAIA study (n=737) were diagnosed with NDMM, were ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT, and received 28-day cycles of D-Rd (n=368) or Rd (n=369). Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.<sup>1</sup> The median age of patients was 73 years (range, 45-90 years). Median PFS was not reached with D-Rd vs. 34.4 months with Rd [HR, 0.53; 95 percent CI, 0.43-0.66; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001]. Of the 186 patients in the Rd arm who received subsequent therapy, 46 percent received DARZALEX<sup>®</sup>.

<b>Additional New Findings from the MAIA Longer-Term Follow-Up Analysis:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Estimated five-year OS rate of 66 percent with D-Rd vs. 53 percent with Rd [HR: 0.68; 95 percent CI, 0.53-0.86; <i>p</i>=0.0013].<sup>1</sup></li>
 	<li>Estimated five-year PFS rate of 53 percent with D-Rd vs. 29 percent with Rd [HR: 0.53; 95 percent CI, 0.43-0.66; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001].<sup>1</sup></li>
 	<li>Median time to next treatment was not reached with D-Rd vs. 42.4 months with Rd [HR: 0.47; 95 percent CI, 0.37-0.59; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001].<sup>1</sup></li>
 	<li>Updated overall response rate (ORR) of 93 percent with D-Rd vs. 82 percent with Rd.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
No new safety concerns were identified in the D-Rd arm. The most common Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (D-Rd: 54 percent; Rd: 37 percent); pneumonia (D-Rd: 19 percent; Rd: 11 percent); anemia (D-Rd: 17 percent; Rd: 22 percent); and lymphopenia (D-Rd: 16 percent; Rd: 11 percent).<sup>1</sup>

""These latest findings from the MAIA study demonstrate the impact of this DARZALEX combination regimen on long-term survival in the frontline setting, further establishing the importance of DARZALEX as a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Craig Tendler</span>, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""These results provide hope and confidence for newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma seeking effective treatment regimens that improve long-term outcomes and reflect our commitment to continuing to explore the full potential of DARZALEX in multiple myeloma.""

<b><u>About the MAIA Trial</u></b>

The randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 study included 737 newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT, aged 45-90 years (median age of 73).<sup>1</sup> Patients were randomized to receive either DARZALEX<sup>®</sup>-Rd (D-Rd) or Rd alone in 28-day cycles. In the D-Rd arm, patients received DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> 16 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) IV weekly for cycles 1 – 2, every two weeks for cycles 3 – 6 and every 4 weeks for cycle 7 and thereafter.<sup>1 </sup>Patients in the D-Rd and Rd treatment arms received 25 mg of lenalidomide on days 1 – 21 of each 28-day cycle, and dexamethasone at 40 mg once a week for each cycle. Patients in both treatment arms continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.<sup>1</sup>

Earlier results from the MAIA study supported the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3193427-1&amp;h=1994642701&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.janssen.com%2Fjanssen-announces-us-fda-approval-darzalex-daratumumab-combination-lenalidomide-and-dexamethasone&amp;a=approval"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">approval</a> of DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> in combination with Rd, marking the first approval of a CD-38 monoclonal antibody for patients with transplant ineligible NDMM.

<b><u>About </u></b><b><u>DARZALEX</u><sup>®</sup></b>

Janssen is committed to exploring the potential of DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> (daratumumab) for patients with multiple myeloma across the spectrum of the disease. DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> has been approved in eight indications, three of which are in the frontline setting, including newly diagnosed patients who are transplant eligible and ineligible.<sup>2</sup>

DARZALEX<sup>® </sup>has become a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma, having been used in the treatment of more than 190,000 patients worldwide and more than 68,000 patients in the U.S. alone since its U.S. FDA approval in 2015.<sup>3</sup> DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> is the first CD38-directed antibody approved globally to treat multiple myeloma.<sup>2</sup>

CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease.<sup>4</sup> DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> binds to CD38 and inhibits tumor cell growth causing myeloma cell death.<sup>4</sup> DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> may also have an effect on normal cells.<sup>4 </sup>Data across eight Phase 3 clinical trials, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that DARZALEX<sup>®</sup>-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.<sup>5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12</sup>

<b><u>About Multiple Myeloma</u></b>

Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.<sup>13,14</sup> When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow. In 2021, it is estimated that more than 34,000 people will be diagnosed and close to 12,000 will die from the disease in the U.S.<sup>15</sup> While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms, which can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood cell counts, tiredness, high calcium levels, kidney problems or infections.<sup>15</sup>

<b>DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> INDICATIONS</b>

DARZALEX<sup>® </sup>(daratumumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma:
<ul>
 	<li>In combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy</li>
 	<li>In combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant</li>
 	<li>In combination with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant</li>
 	<li>In combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy</li>
 	<li>In combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy</li>
 	<li>In combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor</li>
 	<li>As monotherapy in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent</li>
</ul>
<b>DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>CONTRAINDICATIONS</b>

DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactic reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation.

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> can cause severe and/or serious infusion-related reactions including anaphylactic reactions. In clinical trials (monotherapy and combination: N=2066), infusion-related reactions occurred in 37% of patients with the Week 1 (16 mg/kg) infusion, 2% with the Week 2 infusion, and cumulatively 6% with subsequent infusions. Less than 1% of patients had a Grade 3/4 infusion-related reaction at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. The median time to onset was 1.5 hours (range: 0 to 73 hours). Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4 hours of completing DARZALEX<sup>®</sup>. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, laryngeal edema, and pulmonary edema. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting, and nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, and hypotension.

When DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT (CASSIOPEIA) for a median of 3.75 months (range: 2.4 to 6.9 months), upon re-initiation of DARZALEX<sup>®</sup>, the incidence of infusion-related reactions was 11% for the first infusion following ASCT. Infusion-related reactions occurring at re-initiation of DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> following ASCT were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity (Grade 3 or 4: &lt;1%) with those reported in previous studies at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. In EQUULEUS, patients receiving combination treatment (n=97) were administered the first 16 mg/kg dose at Week 1 split over two days, ie, 8 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 2, respectively. The incidence of any grade infusion-related reactions was 42%, with 36% of patients experiencing infusion-related reactions on Day 1 of Week 1, 4% on Day 2 of Week 1, and 8% with subsequent infusions.

Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion. Interrupt DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion.

To reduce the risk of delayed infusion-related reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> infusions. Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

<b>Interference with Serological Testing</b>

Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient's serum. The determination of a patient's ABO and Rh blood type is not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX<sup>®</sup>. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX<sup>®</sup>.

<b>Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia</b>

DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> until recovery of neutrophils or for recovery of platelets.

<b>Interference with Determination of Complete Response</b>

Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> and for 3 months after the last dose.

The combination of DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence =20%) were: upper respiratory infection, neutropenia, infusion–related reactions, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, constipation, anemia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, peripheral edema, nausea, cough, pyrexia, dyspnea, and asthenia. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities (=40%) with DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> are: neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia.

<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 12, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced new data from the Phase 3 GLOW study comparing the efficacy and safety of the combination of IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> (ibrutinib) plus VENCLEXTA<sup>®</sup>/VENCLYXTO<sup>®</sup> (venetoclax) (I+V) versus chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (C+O) for first-line treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who had active disease requiring treatment per the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) criteria. The study met its primary endpoint of superior progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) with a HR 0.216 (95% CI, 0.131-0.357; p &lt; 0.0001), demonstrating a reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for I+V of approximately 78% compared to C+O. I+V is the first all-oral, once-daily, chemotherapy-free, fixed-duration investigational combination. Results of the study will be presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2021 Virtual Congress (<a class=""last-child"" href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3193897-1&amp;h=1800115991&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flibrary.ehaweb.org%2Feha%2F2021%2Feha2021-virtual-congress%2F330172%2Farnon.kater.fixed-duration.ibrutinib.and.venetoclax.28i2Bv29.versus.chlorambucil.html%3Ff%3Dlisting%253D0%252Abrowseby%253D8%252Asortby%253D1%252Asearch%253Dglow&amp;a=Abstract+%23LB1902"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Abstract #LB1902</a>) during late-breaking abstract session on June 12 from 4:00-5:30 p.m. CEST.

The PFS benefit with I+V was consistent across pre-specified subgroups, including patients 65 years and older and those with comorbidities (CIRS &gt;6). The median PFS for C+O was 21 months while the median PFS for I+V had not been reached at the time of analysis. The safety profile of I+V was generally consistent with the safety profile of the single agents and tolerability profiles were consistent with CLL treatment in the enrolled patient population.

""With CLL being one of the most common types of blood cancer, the expansion of research into additional treatment options for patients is an important clinical undertaking,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Arnon Kater</span>, M.D., Ph.D., deputy head of hematology, University of Amsterdam Faculty of Medicine. ""The progression-free survival findings of ibrutinib and venetoclax in the GLOW study are promising and show the potential to become an additional treatment option for people living with CLL.""

Secondary endpoints included rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD), complete response rate (CR) and overall response rate (ORR). The rate of uMRD in the bone marrow as assessed by next generation sequencing was significantly higher for patients treated with I+V compared to those treated with C+O (p&lt;0.0001). Three months after the completion of treatment uMRD was observed in 51.9% and 17.1%, respectively. Peripheral blood (PB) uMRD persisted 12 months after end of treatment in 49% with I+V and 12% with C+O. The CR rate was also significantly higher with I+V vs. C+O (38.7% vs. 11.4%) (p &lt; 0.0001). The ORR was not significantly different between I+V and C+O treated groups. Time to subsequent therapy was longer for I+V (HR 0.143, 95% CI 0.05-0.41).

""We are encouraged by these results, which further support the efficacy of these two well-established therapies,"" said Mohamed Zaki, M.D., Ph.D., vice president and head, global oncology development, AbbVie. ""We remain steadfast in our commitment to continue the research and development of this combination as a potential treatment for CLL with the ultimate goal to put patients into remission with a fixed-duration, oral therapy.""

&nbsp;

The safety profile of I+V was generally consistent with the safety profile of the single agents and tolerability profiles were consistent with CLL treatment in the enrolled patient population. Most common grade =3 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were neutropenia (34.9%), infections (17%), and diarrhea (10.4%) for I+V; neutropenia (49.5%), infections (11.4%), and thrombocytopenia (20%) for C+O. At time of analysis, overall survival was immature; there were eleven deaths in the fixed-duration I+V arm and twelve in the C+O arm. Deaths during treatment occurred in seven patients on I+V and two patients on C+O.

<b class=""first-child"">About CLL</b>
CLL is one of the two most common forms of leukemia in adults and is a type of cancer that can develop from cells in the bone marrow that later mature into certain white blood cells (called lymphocytes). While these cancer cells start in the bone marrow, they later spread into the blood. There are approximately 195,129 people with CLL living in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> with more than 21,000 newly diagnosed patients in 2021.<sup>1,2 </sup>CLL is predominately a disease of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years and is more common among men than women.<sup class=""last-child"">3</sup>

<b class=""first-child"">About the GLOW Study</b><br class=""last-child"" />The GLOW study is a randomized, open label Phase 3 trial comparing progression-free survival in patients treated with either I+V or C+O as assessed by an Independent Review Committee. It enrolled patients (pts) aged =65 years or 18-64 years with cumulative illness rating scale score &gt;6 or creatinine clearance &lt;70 mL/min who had active disease requiring treatment per the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) criteria. Patients with del(17p) or known TP53 mutations were excluded. There were 211 patients randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either I+V (106) and or C+O (105) and the median age was 71 years. Patients assigned to I+V received treatment for 15 cycles (1 cycle is 28 days), starting with three cycles of ibrutinib monotherapy lead-in followed by the combination of I+V for 12 cycles. Patients assigned to C+O were treated for six cycles.

<b class=""first-child"">About IMBRUVICA</b><b><sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup></b><b> (Ibrutinib)</b>
IMBRUVICA<b><sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup></b> (ibrutinib) is a once-daily, first-in-class BTK inhibitor that is administered orally, and is jointly developed and commercialized by Pharmacyclics, LLC, an AbbVie Company, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen). The BTK protein sends important signals that tell B cells to mature and produce antibodies. BTK signaling is needed by specific cancer cells to multiply and spread.<sup>4,5</sup> By blocking BTK, IMBRUVICA may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environments in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.<sup class=""last-child"">6</sup>

Since its launch in 2013, IMBRUVICA has received 11 FDA approvals across six disease areas: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with or without 17p deletion (del17p); small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with or without del17p; Waldenström macroglobulinemia; previously-treated patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)*; previously-treated patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy* – and previously-treated patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy.<sup class=""first-child last-child"">7</sup>

IMBRUVICA is now approved in more than 100 countries and has been used to treat more than 230,000 patients worldwide across its approved indications. IMBRUVICA is the only FDA-approved medicine in WM and cGVHD. IMBRUVICA has been granted four Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA. This designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases. IMBRUVICA was one of the first medicines to receive FDA approval via the Breakthrough Therapy Designation pathway.

Since 2019, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network<sup class=""first-child"">®</sup> (NCCN<sup>®</sup>), a not-for-profit alliance of 28 leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education, recommends ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA<b><sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup></b>) as a preferred regimen for the initial treatment of CLL/SLL and has Category 1 treatment status for treatment-naïve patients without deletion 17p. Since January 2020, the NCCN Guidelines<sup class=""last-child"">®</sup> have categorized IMBRUVICA with or without rituximab as a preferred regimen for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL. As of September 2020, the NCCN guidelines were updated to reflect IMBRUVICA with or without rituximab as the only Category 1 preferred regimen for both untreated and previously treated WM patients.

IMBRUVICA is being studied alone and in combination with other treatments in several blood and solid tumor cancers and other serious illnesses. IMBRUVICA is the most comprehensively studied BTK inhibitor, with more than 150 ongoing clinical trials. There are approximately 30 ongoing company-sponsored trials, 14 of which are in Phase 3, and more than 100 investigator-sponsored trials and external collaborations that are active around the world.

<i class=""first-child last-child"">*Accelerated approval was granted for the MCL and MZL indications based on overall response rate. Continued approval for MCL and MZL may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.</i>

<b class=""first-child"">About VENCLEXTA<sup class=""first-child"">®</sup>/VENCLYXTO<sup class=""last-child"">®</sup> (venetoclax)</b>
VENCLEXTA<sup>®</sup>/VENCLYXTO<sup class=""last-child"">®</sup> (venetoclax) is a first-in-class medicine that selectively binds and inhibits the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers, BCL-2 prevents cancer cells from undergoing their natural death or self-destruction process, called apoptosis. VENCLXEXTA/VENCLYXTO targets the BCL-2 protein and works to help restore the process of apoptosis.

VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. Together, the companies are committed to BCL-2 research and to studying venetoclax in clinical trials across several blood cancers. Venetoclax is approved in more than 80 countries, including the U.S.

<b class=""first-child"">US VENCLEXTA<sup class=""first-child"">® </sup>Important Safety Information<b class=""last-child""><sup class=""first-child last-child"">8</sup></b></b>
<b>What is the most important information I should know about VENCLEXTA?</b>
<b>VENCLEXTA can cause serious side effects, including:</b>
<b class=""last-child"">Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).</b> TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause kidney failure, the need for dialysis treatment, and may lead to death. Your healthcare provider will do tests to check your risk of getting TLS before you start taking VENCLEXTA. You will receive other medicines before starting and during treatment with VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of TLS. You may also need to receive intravenous (IV) fluids into your vein. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check for TLS when you first start treatment and during treatment with VENCLEXTA. It is important to keep your appointments for blood tests. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of TLS during treatment with VENCLEXTA, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, confusion, shortness of breath, seizures, irregular heartbeat, dark or cloudy urine, unusual tiredness, or muscle or joint pain.

<b class=""first-child"">Drink plenty of water during treatment with VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of getting TLS.</b> <br class=""last-child"" />Drink 6 to 8 glasses (about 56 ounces total) of water each day, starting 2 days before your first dose, on the day of your first dose of VENCLEXTA, and each time your dose is increased.

Your healthcare provider may delay, decrease your dose, or stop treatment with VENCLEXTA if you have side effects. When restarting VENCLEXTA after stopping for 1 week or longer, your healthcare provider may again check for your risk of TLS and change your dose.

<b class=""first-child"">Who should not take VENCLEXTA?</b>
<b class=""last-child"">Certain medicines must not be taken when you first start taking VENCLEXTA and while your dose is being slowly increased because of the risk of increased TLS.</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li class=""first-child"">Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. VENCLEXTA and other medicines may affect each other causing serious side effects.</li>
 	<li class=""last-child"">Do not start new medicines during treatment with VENCLEXTA without first talking with your healthcare provider.</li>
</ul>
<b class=""first-child"">Before taking VENCLEXTA, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions,</b> <b class=""last-child"">including if you:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li class=""first-child"">have kidney or liver problems.</li>
 	<li>have problems with your body salts or electrolytes, such as potassium, phosphorus, or calcium.</li>
 	<li>have a history of high uric acid levels in your blood or gout.</li>
 	<li>are scheduled to receive a vaccine. You should not receive a ""live vaccine"" before, during, or after treatment with VENCLEXTA, until your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. If you are not sure about the type of immunization or vaccine, ask your healthcare provider. These vaccines may not be safe or may not work as well during treatment with VENCLEXTA.</li>
 	<li>are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. VENCLEXTA may harm your unborn baby. If you are able to become pregnant, your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with VENCLEXTA, and you should use effective birth control during treatment and for at least 30 days after the last dose of VENCLEXTA. If you become pregnant or think you are pregnant, tell your healthcare provider right away.</li>
 	<li class=""last-child"">are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if VENCLEXTA passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment with VENCLEXTA and for 1 week after the last dose.</li>
</ul>
<b class=""first-child"">What should I avoid while taking VENCLEXTA?</b> <br class=""last-child"" />You should not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit, Seville oranges (often used in marmalades), or starfruit while you are taking VENCLEXTA. These products may increase the amount of VENCLEXTA in your blood.

<b class=""first-child"">What are the possible side effects of VENCLEXTA?</b>
<b class=""last-child"">VENCLEXTA can cause serious side effects, including:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kite, a Gilead Company (Nasdaq: GILD), today announced follow-up results from the pivotal ZUMA-5 trial of Yescarta<sup>®</sup> (axicabtagene ciloleucel) – the first and only CAR T-cell therapy approved in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent follicular lymphoma (FL). At a minimum follow-up of 18 months, 94% of patients had achieved a response, and secondary endpoints of median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were not yet reached. In a weighted analysis comparing ZUMA-5 patients with a minimum of 18 months follow-up with those observed in SCHOLAR-5, an external control cohort, Yescarta demonstrated superior OS and PFS over currently available treatments. These data were presented today as a part of a late-breaking session at the 26<sup>th </sup>Annual Meeting of the European Hematology Association (EHA2021) taking place virtually this year from June 9-17 (Abstract #LB1904).

“Follicular lymphoma is one of the most common non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and patients can experience frequent relapses, which quickly leaves us short of treatment options,” said Professor John Gribben, Professor of Medical Oncology at the Cancer Research UK Barts Centre, London, UK and study author. “We are very encouraged by these data that suggest a significant and sustained survival benefit with Yescarta even after multiple rounds of prior treatment.”

The propensity score analysis compared follow-up data (median follow-up of 23.3 months; in at least 80 patients with FL) from the pivotal Phase 2 ZUMA-5 study (n=86) to a weighted sample from the SCHOLAR-5 external control cohort of current therapies (n=85), balanced for patient characteristics through propensity scoring. Ninety-four percent of patients in the ZUMA-5 cohort achieved a response compared to 50% of patients in the control cohort (median follow-up of 26.2 months), with an odds ratio of 16.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.6-46.9). Yescarta demonstrated a 58% reduction in the risk of death (HR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.21-0.83, p=0.01) and 70% reduction in the risk of disease progression, relapse or death (HR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.18-0.49, p&lt;0.001) versus current therapies in the control cohort. While median OS and PFS were both not reached in ZUMA-5, median PFS and OS were 12.7 months and 59.8 months, respectively, in the control cohort.

In the ZUMA-5 safety analysis set (n=146), Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities occurred in 8% and 21% of patients, respectively.

“In an indolent disease like follicular lymphoma, longer-term data that demonstrate durable responses are critical. After a patient with follicular lymphoma relapses, the duration of response shortens with each new therapy,” said Caron A. Jacobson, MD, MMSc, Medical Director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Assistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School. “The continued durable benefit demonstrated by axicabtagene ciloleucel at nearly two years is exciting, and the substantial survival benefit over current therapies that we’re seeing in the SCHOLAR-5 analysis is encouraging. These follow-up data reinforce axicabtagene ciloleucel as an important advance for a group of patients who have historically had few options.”

Yescarta received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy in March 2021. The Yescarta U.S. Prescribing Information has a BOXED WARNING for the risks of CRS and neurologic toxicities, and Yescarta is approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) due to these risks; see below for Important Safety Information.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About ZUMA-5</span></b>

ZUMA-5 is an ongoing, single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating 146 patients (=18 years old) with relapsed or refractory iNHL including FL, who received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, including the combination of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an alkylating agent. Efficacy was established on the basis of objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) as assessed by an independent review committee per the 2014 Lugano Classification.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About SCHOLAR-5</span></b>

SCHOLAR-5 is an international, multicenter, retrospective external control cohort of patients with relapsed or refractory FL. Data were sourced from seven institutions across five countries from patients who initiated a third-line or higher therapy after July 2014. In these later lines of treatment, therapeutic regimens are highly heterogenous and without any clear standard of care. Data from the pivotal idelalisib DELTA trial were also included. ZUMA-5 eligibility criteria were applied to the cohort, with patients excluded or censored upon transformation. Single agent anti-CD20 antibody was not counted as line of therapy for eligibility, similar to ZUMA-5 eligibility requirements.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Indolent Follicular Lymphoma</span></b>

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a form of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) in which malignant tumors slowly grow but can become more aggressive over time. FL is the most common form of indolent lymphoma and the second most common type of lymphoma globally. It accounts for approximately 22% of all lymphomas diagnosed worldwide. Currently, there are limited options for the treatment of relapsed or refractory indolent FL after two or more lines of therapy.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Yescarta</span></b>

Yescarta is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma.
<span class=""bwuline"">Limitations of Use</span>: Yescarta is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).</li>

<b><span class=""bwuline"">U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME AND NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Yescarta. Do not administer Yescarta to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Neurologic toxicities, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Yescarta, including concurrently with CRS or after CRS resolution. Monitor for neurologic toxicities after treatment with Yescarta. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Yescarta is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS)</b>, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred. CRS occurred in 88% (224/254) of all patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including Grade =3 in 10%. CRS occurred in 94% (101/108) of patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), including Grade =3 in 13%. Among patients with LBCL who died after receiving Yescarta, 4 had ongoing CRS events at the time of death. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 days (range: 1-12 days) and the median duration was 7 days (range: 2-58 days) for patients with LBCL. CRS occurred in 84% (123/146) of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL), including Grade =3 in 8% (11/146). Among patients with iNHL who died after receiving Yescarta, 1 patient had an ongoing CRS event at the time of death. The median time to onset of CRS was 4 days (range: 1-20 days) and median duration was 6 days (range: 1-27 days) for patients with iNHL. Key manifestations of CRS (=10%) in all patients combined included fever (80%), hypotension (38%), tachycardia (29%), hypoxia (21%), chills (21%), and headache (13%). Serious events that may be associated with CRS include cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, renal insufficiency, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, multi-organ failure and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. In a subsequent cohort of LBCL patients, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids were administered for ongoing Grade 1 events. CRS occurred in 93% (38/41) of these patients and 2% (1/41) had Grade 3 CRS, with no patients experiencing a Grade 4 or 5 event. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 days (range: 1 to 8 days) and the median duration of CRS was 7 days (range: 2 to 16 days). Key manifestations of CRS (&gt;5%) included pyrexia, hypotension, chills, headache, nausea, tachycardia, C-reactive protein increased, fatigue, hypoxia, and vomiting. Ensure that 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to Yescarta infusion. Following infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility, and for 4 weeks thereafter. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated.

<b>NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES </b>that were fatal or life-threatening occurred. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 81% (206/254) of all patients with NHL receiving Yescarta, including Grade =3 in 26%. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 87% (94/108) of patients with LBCL, including Grade =3 in 31%. The median time to onset was 4 days (range: 1-43 days) and the median duration was 17 days for patients with LBCL. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 77% (112/146) of patients with iNHL, including Grade =3 in 21%. The median time to onset was 6 days (range: 1-79 days) and the median duration was 16 days for patients with iNHL. 98% of all neurologic toxicities in patients with LBCL and 99% of all neurologic toxicities in patients with iNHL occurred within the first 8 weeks of Yescarta infusion. Neurologic toxicities occurred within the first 7 days of infusion for 89% of affected patients with LBCL and 74% of affected patients with iNHL. The most common neurologic toxicities (=10%) in all patients combined included encephalopathy (53%), headache (45%), tremor (31%), dizziness (20%), delirium (16%), aphasia (15%), and insomnia (11%). Prolonged encephalopathy lasting up to 173 days was noted. Serious events, including leukoencephalopathy and seizures, as well as fatal and serious cases of cerebral edema, have occurred. In a subsequent cohort of LBCL patients who received corticosteroids at the onset of Grade 1 toxicities, neurologic toxicities occurred in 78% (32/41) of these patients and 20% (8/41) had Grade 3 neurologic toxicities with no patients experiencing a Grade 4 or 5 event. The median time to onset of neurologic toxicities was 6 days (range: 1-93 days) with a median duration of 8 days (range: 1-144 days). The most common neurologic toxicities were consistent with the overall LBCL population treated with Yescarta. Following Yescarta infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility, and for 4 weeks thereafter, and treat promptly.

<b>REMS: </b>Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Yescarta is available only through a restricted program called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program which requires that: Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer Yescarta must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements and must have on-site, immediate access to a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab for each patient for infusion within 2 hours after Yescarta infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS. Certified healthcare facilities must ensure that healthcare providers who prescribe, dispense, or administer Yescarta are trained about the management of CRS and neurologic toxicities.

<b>HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: </b>Allergic reactions, including serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis, may occur with the infusion of Yescarta.

<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS: </b>Severe or life-threatening infections occurred. Infections (all grades) occurred in 47% (119/254) of all patients with NHL. Grade =3 infections occurred in 19% of patients, Grade =3 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 15%, bacterial infections in 5%, viral infections in 2%, and fungal infections in 1%. Yescarta should not be administered to patients with clinically significant active systemic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic anti-microbials according to local guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 40% of all patients with NHL and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. In immunosuppressed patients, including those who have received Yescarta, life-threatening and fatal opportunistic infections including disseminated fungal infections (e.g., candida sepsis and aspergillus infections) and viral reactivation (e.g., human herpes virus-6 [HHV-6] encephalitis and JC virus progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]) have been reported. The possibility of HHV-6 encephalitis and PML should be considered in immunosuppressed patients with neurologic events and appropriate diagnostic evaluations should be performed. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. Perform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

<b>PROLONGED CYTOPENIAS: </b>Patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Yescarta infusion. Grade =3 cytopenias not resolved by Day 30 following Yescarta infusion occurred in 30% of all patients with NHL and included neutropenia (22%), thrombocytopenia (13%), and anemia (5%). Monitor blood counts after infusion.

<b>HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA </b>and B-cell aplasia can occur. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 17% of all patients with NHL. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following Yescarta treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Yescarta treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment.

<b>SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES </b>may develop. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that one occurs, contact Kite at 1-844-454-KITE (5483) to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.

<b>EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES: </b>Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following Yescarta infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</b> The most common adverse reactions (incidence =20%) in patients with LBCL included CRS, fever, hypotension, encephalopathy, tachycardia, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, chills, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, infections with pathogen unspecified, nausea, hypoxia, tremor, cough, vomiting, dizziness, constipation, and cardiac arrhythmias. The most common non-laboratory adverse reactions (incidence =20%) in patients with iNHL included fever, CRS, hypotension, encephalopathy, fatigue, headache, infections with pathogen unspecified, tachycardia, febrile neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, tremor, chills, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, cough, vomiting, hypoxia, arrhythmia, and dizziness.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 14, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced topline results from the Phase 3 STAR study of timrepigene emparvovec (BIIB111/AAV2-REP1), an investigational gene therapy for the potential treatment of choroideremia. The STAR study did not meet its primary endpoint of proportion of participants with a =15 letter improvement from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at Month 12, in the interventional group in comparison to the non-interventional control group, as measured by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. In addition, the study did not demonstrate efficacy on key secondary endpoints. Safety results from the Phase 3 STAR study were consistent with previous studies.

“We extend our deepest gratitude to all those who contributed to the STAR study, including the participants, investigators, site staff and the broader choroideremia community,” said Katherine Dawson, M.D., head of the Therapeutics Development Unit at Biogen. “While we are disappointed by the results of the STAR study, we are hopeful that the clinical insights gleaned from this study may help to shape therapeutic innovation for inherited retinal diseases including choroideremia, so that in the future there may be treatment options for the community affected by these debilitating disorders.”

Biogen will evaluate the complete data set before confirming next steps for the timrepigene emparvovec clinical development program. Detailed results of this study will be made available at a future scientific forum.

<strong>About timrepigene emparvovec (BIIB111/AAV2-REP1)</strong>
Timrepigene emparvovec is an investigational recombinant AAV2 vector designed to deliver a functional version of the human choroideremia gene into the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells that aims to address the underlying genetic cause of choroideremia.

<strong>About the STAR Phase 3 Study (NCT03496012)</strong>
STAR was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, three-arm, parallel-controlled group study that enrolled 169 adult males with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of choroideremia. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single subretinal injection of investigational timrepigene emparvovec. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an improvement of at least 15 letters from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 12 months post-treatment as measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. While the Phase 3 STAR study did not meet its primary endpoint, more information about the study is available here: <a title=""www.clinicaltrials.gov"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y14xeLvQX9apxXrtfOmccIirr4wH3Fsa3lkov-UIX8CwnToXyhhjFv6NlN3OqGGFR2gGPvcLcD14KLbpfx-Ai5hU21dCGAtcbwS0ROUIUAOZ6435qIF3NHggT4L3uxeGSVRdrHnkBxhgmurkEGPHr9c7JpcHKBMID4ctQuAL2NE="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>.

<strong>About Choroideremia</strong>
Choroideremia is a rare, inherited retinal disease resulting in progressive vision loss, ultimately leading to blindness. Choroideremia is an X-linked recessive chorioretinal disease that is caused by loss of function mutations in the choroideremia gene resulting in decreased Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1) expression which leads to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors and choroid. Initially, patients with choroideremia experience poor night vision and over time, slow, progressive visual loss ultimately leads to blindness. Visual impairments due to choroideremia are associated with emotional, functional and economic burden.

GAITHERSBURG, Md., June 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), today announced that NVX-CoV2373, its recombinant nanoparticle protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, demonstrated 100% protection against moderate and severe disease, 90.4% efficacy overall, and met the primary endpoint in its PREVENT-19 pivotal Phase 3 trial. The study enrolled 29,960 participants across 119 sites in the U.S. and Mexico to evaluate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity, with an emphasis on recruiting a representative population of communities and demographic groups most impacted by the disease.

""Today, Novavax is one step closer to addressing the critical and persistent global public health need for additional COVID-19 vaccines. These clinical results reinforce that NVX-CoV2373 is extremely effective and offers complete protection against both moderate and severe COVID-19 infection,"" said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer, Novavax. ""Novavax continues to work with a sense of urgency to complete our regulatory submissions and deliver this vaccine, built on a well understood and proven platform, to a world that is still in great need of vaccines.""

The company intends to file for regulatory authorizations in the third quarter, upon completion of the final phases of process qualification and assay validation needed to meet chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) requirements. Upon regulatory approvals, Novavax remains on track to reach manufacturing capacity of 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter and 150 million doses per month by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.

""PREVENT-19 confirms that NVX-CoV2373 offers a reassuring tolerability and safety profile,"" said Gregory M. Glenn, M.D., President of Research and Development, Novavax. ""These data show consistent, high levels of efficacy and reaffirm the ability of the vaccine to prevent COVID-19 amid ongoing genetic evolution of the virus. Our vaccine will be a critical part of the solution to COVID-19 and we are grateful to the study participants and trial staff who made this study possible, as well as our supporters, including the U.S. Government.""

<strong>Results: Consistent, high efficacy among circulating variants</strong>

In the placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study randomized 2:1, NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated overall efficacy of 90.4% (95% CI: 82.9, 94.6), achieving its primary endpoint. Seventy-seven cases were observed: 63 in the placebo group and 14 in the vaccine group. All cases observed in the vaccine group were mild as defined by the trial protocol. Ten moderate cases and four severe cases were observed, all in the placebo group, yielding a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI: 87.0, 100) against moderate or severe disease.

Efficacy endpoints were accrued from January 25 through April 30, 2021 — a time when the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant, first identified in the U.K., became the predominant strain in the U.S. Other strains, including Variants of Interest (VoI) and Variants of Concern (VoC), were also on the rise during the PREVENT-19 endpoint accrual window. <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3194860-1&amp;h=1002882103&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvariants%2Fvariant-info.html&amp;a=Click+here+for+CDC+definitions+of+variants"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Click here for CDC definitions of variants</a>.

Sequence data are available for 54 of the 77 cases. PREVENT-19 met its key secondary endpoint, demonstrating 100% efficacy (95% CI: 80.8, 100) against variants not considered VoC/VoI. Of the sequenced cases, 35 (65%) were VoC, 9 (17%) were VoI, and 10 (19%) were other variants. Against VoC/VoI, which represented 82% of the cases, vaccine efficacy was 93.2% (95% CI: 83.9, 97.1), achieving a key exploratory endpoint of the study. Thirty-eight of the VoC/VoI cases were in the placebo group and 6 were in the vaccine group.

NVX-CoV2373 also showed success among ""high-risk"" populations (defined as over age 65, under age 65 with certain comorbidities or having life circumstances with frequent COVID-19 exposure): vaccine efficacy was 91.0% (95% CI: 83.6, 95.0), with 62 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group and 13 COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group.

<strong>Results: Reasserting a favorable safety profile</strong>

Preliminary safety data from PREVENT-19 showed the vaccine to be generally well-tolerated. Serious and severe adverse events were low in number and balanced between vaccine and placebo groups. No single adverse event term was reported by more than 1% of participants. In assessing reactogenicity 7 days after Dose 1 and Dose 2, injection site pain and tenderness, generally mild to moderate in severity, were the most common local symptoms, lasting less than 3 days. Fatigue, headache and muscle pain were the most common systemic symptoms, lasting less than 2 days.

<strong>Study Endpoints</strong>

The primary endpoint for PREVENT-19 was the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants at baseline. The statistical success criterion included a lower bound of 95% CI &gt;30%.

Novavax expects to share further details of the PREVENT-19 trial results as additional data become available. Further analyses of the trial are ongoing and will be shared via preprint servers as well as submitted to peer-review journals for publication.

The placebo-controlled portion of PREVENT-19 continues in adolescents from 12 to less than 18 years of age, which recently completed enrollment with 2,248 participants.

<strong>Variant Virus Strains</strong>

The CDC has defined Variant of Interest (VoI) as a variant with genetic markers that have been associated with changes to receptor binding, reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination, or predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity. A Variant of Concern (VoC) is defined as a variant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease, significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.<strong> </strong>

<strong>About NVX-CoV2373</strong>

NVX-CoV2373 is a protein-based vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of the first strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. NVX-CoV2373 was created using Novavax' recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and is formulated with Novavax' patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. NVX-CoV2373 contains purified protein antigen and can neither replicate, nor can it cause COVID-19. In preclinical studies, NVX-CoV2373 induced antibodies that blocked the binding of spike protein to cellular receptors and provided protection from infection and disease. It was generally well-tolerated and elicited robust antibody response in Phase 1/2 clinical testing.

NVX-CoV2373 is being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 trials: a trial in the U.K. that demonstrated efficacy of 96.4% against the original virus strain, 86.3% against the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant and 89.7% overall; and the PREVENT-19 trial in the U.S. and Mexico that began in December 2020. It is also being tested in two ongoing Phase 2 studies that began in August 2020: A Phase 2b trial in South Africa that demonstrated 55% efficacy overall in HIV-negative participants and 48.6% efficacy against the B.1.351 (Beta) variant, and a Phase 1/2 study in the U.S. and Australia.

NVX-CoV2373 is stored and stable at 2°- 8°C, allowing the use of existing vaccine supply chain channels for its distribution. It is packaged in a ready-to-use liquid formulation in 10-dose vials.

<strong>About Matrix-M™ Adjuvant</strong>

Novavax' patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant has demonstrated a potent and well-tolerated effect by stimulating the entry of antigen-presenting cells into the injection site and enhancing antigen presentation in local lymph nodes, boosting immune response.

New data from Public Health England (PHE) demonstrated <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca </i>offers high levels of protection against the Delta variant (B.1.617.2; formerly the ‘Indian’ variant).

Real world data from PHE, published as a pre-print<i>,</i> demonstrated two doses of <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca </i>are 92% effective against hospitalisation due to the Delta variant and showed no deaths among those vaccinated. The vaccine also showed a high level of effectiveness against the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7; formerly the ‘Kent’ variant) with an 86% reduction of hospitalisations and no deaths reported.

The data suggest that vaccine effectiveness against milder symptomatic disease, although significant, was lower. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease was 74% against the Alpha variant and 64% against the Delta variant.

The higher efficacy against severe disease and hospitalisation is supported by recent data showing strong T-cell response to <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i>, which should correlate with high and durable protection.<sup>1</sup>

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “This real world evidence shows that <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i> provides a high level of protection against the Delta variant, which is currently a critical area of concern given its rapid transmission. The data show that the vaccine will continue to have a significant impact around the world given that it continues to account for the overwhelming majority of supplies to India and the COVAX facility.”

The analysis included 14,019 cases of the Delta variant – 166 of whom were hospitalised – between 12 April and 4 June, looking at emergency hospital admissions in England.

This real world evidence<i> </i>against the Delta variant is based on limited follow up after the second dose which could impact the effectiveness estimate.

The Delta variant is a key contributor to the current wave of infection in the Indian subcontinent and beyond. It has recently replaced the Alpha variant as the dominant strain in Scotland and is responsible for a notable increase in cases in the United Kingdom. The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has recommended <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i> in countries where new variants, like the Delta variant of concern, are prevalent.

<b><i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i>, formerly AZD1222
</b><i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i> was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

The vaccine has been granted a conditional marketing authorisation or emergency use in more than 80 countries across six continents. More than 500 million doses of <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i> have been supplied to 165 countries worldwide, including more than 100 countries through the COVAX Facility.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","SHANGHAI, June 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Asieris Pharmaceuticals (Asieris) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Investigational New Drug (IND) application of oral APL-1202 in combination with BeiGene’s tislelizumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Asieris will accelerate the initiation of the clinical trial enrollment in the U.S. and also file a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) to the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China in the near future.

This is an open-label, multi-center Phase I/II clinical study with the following objectives: to evaluate the safety in MIBC patients; to determine the RP2D (recommended Phase 2 dose), and to assess efficacy as neoadjuvant therapy for MIBC.

APL-1202 is an orally available reversible MetAP2 Inhibitor with anti-angiogenic, anti-tumor activities and can also modulate tumor immune microenvironment. It is currently in Phase III/pivotal clinical trials in China, either as single agent as first-line treatment for patients with intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), or in combination with a chemotherapy as second-line treatment in patients with intermediate and high-risk chemo-refractory NMIBC. Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc?R on macrophages. The China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has granted tislelizumab approval in three indications, including full approval for first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy; and conditional approval for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL) who received at least two prior therapies and for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with PD-L1 high expression whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Full approval for these indications is contingent upon results from ongoing randomized, controlled confirmatory clinical trials.

According to the 2020 Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Urothelial Carcinoma, the Level I recommendation for MIBC is that patients who tolerate cisplatin undergo radical cystectomy (RC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  The commonly used chemotherapy regimen is gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC). However, cisplatin can cause serious side effects such as renal dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, and bone marrow suppression, and some patients are intolerant. Patients with intolerance to cisplatin don’t have any preoperative/neoadjuvant therapy that can bring survival benefits.

“We are very pleased that FDA approved the IND application for oral APL-1202 in combination with tislelizumab as a neoadjuvant therapy in MIBC patients,” said Dr. Xue Yong, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer at Asieris. “The approval is expected to accelerate the clinical development, and Asieris will conitnue to explore cutting-edge technologies and therapeutics in our focused areas to meet the urgent medical needs and establish an outstanding portfolio that covers diagnosis and treatment to benefit more patients. ”

AstraZeneca today announced results from the STORM CHASER trial assessing the safety and efficacy of AZD7442, a long-acting antibody (LAAB) combination, for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 in participants recently exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of post-exposure prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 with AZD7442 compared to placebo.

Trial participants were unvaccinated adults 18 years and over with confirmed exposure to a person with a case of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the past eight days. In the overall trial population, AZD7442 reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 33% (95% confidence interval (CI): -26, 65) compared to placebo, which was not statistically significant (Table 1).

The trial included 1,121 participants in a 2:1 randomisation AZD7442 to placebo, with 23 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 accrued in the AZD7442 arm (23/749) and 17 cases accrued in the placebo arm (17/372). All participants had a negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody test on the day of dosing to exclude prior infection, and a nasopharyngeal swab was also collected and subsequently analysed for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR to detect virus.

Given the importance of finding therapies for COVID-19 and to help interpret trial results during the pandemic, additional analyses were performed and are being communicated (Table 1).

In a pre-planned analysis of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive (detectable virus) and PCR negative (no detectable virus) participants, AZD7442 reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 73% (95% CI: 27, 90) compared with placebo, in participants who were PCR negative at time of dosing. In a post-hoc analysis, in participants who were PCR negative at baseline, AZD7442 reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 92% (95% CI: 32, 99) versus placebo <a id=""_Hlk74570380"" name=""_Hlk74570380""></a>more than seven days following dosing, and by 51% (95% CI: -71, 86) up to seven days following dosing.

Myron J. Levin, MD, Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, US, and principal investigator on the trial, said: “The results of STORM CHASER suggest that AZD7442 may be useful in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in individuals not already infected. The PROVENT trial will give us more clarity in this patient population. While COVID-19 vaccination efforts have been successful, there is still a significant need for prevention and treatment options for certain populations, including those unable to be vaccinated or those who may have an inadequate response to vaccination.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “While this trial did not meet the primary endpoint against symptomatic illness, we are encouraged by the protection seen in the PCR negative participants following treatment with AZD7442. We await results from PROVENT, our pre-exposure prevention trial and TACKLE, our treatment trial in preventing more severe disease, to understand the potential role of AZD7442 in protecting against COVID-19.”

AZD7442 was well tolerated in the trial. Preliminary analyses show similar adverse events in the placebo and treatment arms.

Full results from STORM CHASER will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

<b>Financial considerations
</b>On 16 March 2021, AstraZeneca <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/us-supply-agreement-for-additional-azd7442-doses.html"">announced</a> an extended agreement with the US Government to supply up to 500,000 additional doses of AZD7442 for $205m, contingent on AZD7442 receiving Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorisation in post-exposure prophylaxis. Discussions regarding next steps with the US Government are ongoing.

<b>STORM CHASER
</b>STORM CHASER is a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial assessing the safety and efficacy of a single 300mg dose of AZD7442 compared to placebo for the post-exposure prevention of COVID-19. The trial was conducted in 59 sites in the UK and US. 1,121 participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular (IM) dose of either 300mg of AZD7442 (n=749) or saline placebo (n=372), administered in two separate, sequential IM injections. The primary efficacy endpoint is the first case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness occurring post dose to Day 183. The primary analysis was to be conducted 30 days after 25 events meeting the primary efficacy endpoint definition had occurred. This primary analysis includes data and additional events accumulated up to 7 April 2021, 30 days after the symptom assessment date of the 25th event; participants will continue to be followed for 15 months.

The post hoc analysis looked at cases of symptomatic COVID-19 in the PCR-negative group occurring seven days or less after dosing and more than seven days after dosing. This was based on the known incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Cases occurring more than seven days after dosing are likely to be due to infection that occurred after dosing rather than before.<sup>1</sup>

Participants were adults 18 years and over with potential exposure, within eight days, to a specific identified individual with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus, symptomatic or asymptomatic, and who were therefore assessed at the time of enrolment to be at appreciable risk of imminently developing COVID-19. Such individuals included, but were not limited to, those who shared a household, those living in institutional residences (military lodging, dormitories, etc.), health care workers, long-term care facility workers, and workers in occupational or industrial settings in which close contact is common.

<b>AZD7442
</b>AZD7442 is a combination of two LAABs - tixagevimab (AZD8895) and cilgavimab (AZD1061) - derived from B cells donated by convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 virus. Discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/articles/2020/advancing-our-discovery-of-novel-coronavirus-neutralising-antibodies-against-covid-19.html"">licensed to AstraZeneca in June 2020</a>, the human monoclonal antibodies bind to distinct sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein<sup>2</sup> and were optimised by AstraZeneca with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor binding. The half-life extension approximately triples the durability of its action compared to conventional antibodies and could afford six to 12 months of protection from COVID-19 following a single administration.<sup>3-6</sup> The reduced Fc receptor binding aims to minimise the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease - a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies promote, rather than inhibit, infection and/or disease.<sup>7</sup>

AZD7442 is currently being tested in several additional COVID-19 prevention and treatment trials: <a href=""https://www.c19proventstudy.com/#!/"" rel=""link-confirmation"">PROVENT</a><sup>8</sup> Phase III trial of over 5,000 participants in pre-exposure prophylaxis; <a href=""https://www.tackle-covid-19.com/en-US/"" rel=""link-confirmation"">TACKLE COVID-19</a><sup>9</sup> Phase III treatment trial in outpatient setting; and collaborator treatment trials in outpatient and hospitalised settings. AZD7442 is being assessed in both IM and intravenous administration routes.

AZD7442 is being developed with support from the US Government, including federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in partnership with the Department of Defense; Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense; under Contract No. W911QY-21-9-0001.

Preliminary ‘in vitro’ findings from investigators at Oxford University and Columbia University also demonstrate that AZD7442 neutralises recent emergent SARS-CoV-2 viral variants.<sup>10-14</sup>

Data published in <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2548-6"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>Nature</i></a> in July 2020 showed that in pre-clinical experiments, the LAABs were able to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to host cells and protect against infection in cell and animal models of disease.<sup>15</sup>

Under the terms of the licensing agreement with Vanderbilt, AstraZeneca will pay single-digit royalties on future net sales.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sage Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SAGE) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that the WATERFALL Study in patients with MDD met its primary endpoint with zuranolone (SAGE-217/BIIB125) 50 mg showing statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms compared with placebo at Day 15 as assessed by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) total score. LS means (SE) change from baseline in HAMD-17 total score at Day 15 for patients who received zuranolone 50 mg was -14.1 (0.51) compared with -12.3 (0.50) for patients who received placebo (LS mean difference -1.7 points; p=0.0141).

Monoamine-based antidepressants have been the standard of care for chronic treatment of MDD for the past 60 years. They are treatments administered daily, which require sufficient exposure and continuous use to maintain effect. Zuranolone is a two-week, once-daily oral drug under investigation for the treatment of MDD. It is a molecule that is designed to potentially provide a rapid-acting, sustainable treatment option, and could represent a breakthrough in the current management of depression.

The WATERFALL Study was a pivotal, Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of zuranolone 50 mg in adults 18 to 64 years with MDD (N=543). The WATERFALL Study enrolled patients who had MDD with a HAMD-17 total score =24 at screening and Day 1 prior to dosing.

“Sage’s expertise in the modulation of the GABA receptor pathway in the brain, coupled with insights on the treatment wants and needs of clinicians and patients, has resulted in our targeting a unique benefit/risk profile with the development of zuranolone supported to date by the data generated in the WATERFALL Study and the broader Landscape and NEST programs,” said Barry Greene, Chief Executive Officer at Sage Therapeutics. “We dared to imagine a different future for the treatment of MDD where patients have the potential to experience a rapid response that is well-tolerated and that may enable them to stay better with long periods free from depression symptoms, and free from daily chronic treatments and related side effects. In doing so, we aspire to help eliminate stigma associated with brain health disorders so that we can move beyond brain health awareness to brain health action.”

“Together with our collaboration partners at Sage, we are proud to announce highly encouraging results from the Phase 3 WATERFALL Study of zuranolone in major depressive disorder. These results represent hope and positive progress for the more than 250 million patients worldwide who are estimated to live with depression,” said Alfred Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., Head of Research and Development at Biogen. “Major depressive disorder is a common co-morbidity of many diseases represented in Biogen’s neuroscience portfolio. We believe zuranolone has the potential to offer a unique, first-in-class therapeutic for depression with a distinct benefit-risk profile to people living with this common but serious mental health condition.”

Zuranolone was generally well-tolerated in the WATERFALL Study and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous clinical studies. The rate of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the zuranolone group was 60.1% (161/268) vs the placebo group at 44.6% (120/269). The majority of the TEAEs were mild to moderate. The most common TEAEs that were = 5% in patients treated with zuranolone (rates vs placebo) included somnolence 15.3% (vs 3.0%), dizziness 13.8% (vs 2.2%), headache 10.8% (vs 7.8%), and sedation 7.5% (vs 0.4%); these events predominantly occurred during the 14-day treatment period. Throughout the study, a total of two patients each (0.7%) reported serious adverse events (SAEs) in the zuranolone and placebo groups; no death occurred in the study. The percent of patients reporting TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation was 3.4% (9/268) and 1.5% (4/269), in the zuranolone and placebo groups, respectively. No signal for withdrawal symptoms as assessed by the 20-item Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC-20), or for increased suicidal ideation or behavior as per the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) were identified.

“I’m really excited about these breakthrough data: we know MDD is episodic and zuranolone has the potential to treat episodically. The LANDSCAPE clinical studies are all helpful taken together because they provide data on both short- and long-term use of zuranolone,” said Anita H. Clayton, M.D., Chair of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences, University of Virginia School of Medicine. “These data suggest that this treatment, if approved, has the potential to work fast with a short-course of therapy that is well-tolerated, with the effect maintained over the long-term. This will empower my patients to think differently about their depression and treatment, and to rapidly return to their life. Depression is not an identity, it’s an episodic disorder that we hope in the future to be able to treat quickly with treatments that are well-tolerated and with benefits that last.”

“MDD is a pressing mental health concern and, unlike physical health concerns where innovation is commonplace, many of the treatments for MDD were first approved more than two decades ago,” said Paul Gionfriddo, President and CEO of Mental Health America (MHA). “We welcome today’s news, and the potential for a new and innovative treatment that could change the way we treat depression.”

Zuranolone has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration, and the Companies intend to discuss next steps with the Agency. Full data from the WATERFALL Study will be shared at future scientific forums.

Patients with a response at Day 15 in the zuranolone group retained on average 86.1% of their HAMD-17 improvement at Day 42 (4 weeks after dosing ended). A similar maintenance of response was also observed with the MADRS scale, where people who responded to zuranolone at Day 15 maintained 87.6% of that response at Day 42. While not statistically significant, a numerical advantage in favor of zuranolone was demonstrated at Day 42.

<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Adverse events were consistent with the safety profile of zuranolone seen to date in clinical studies.</li>
 	<li>The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the zuranolone group was 60.1% (161/268) vs the placebo group at 44.6% (120/269).</li>

<b>About the WATERFALL Study</b>

The WATERFALL Study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of zuranolone in adults with major depressive disorder. In the study, 543 patients were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive zuranolone 50 mg, or placebo, once-nightly for two weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) total score at Day 15. Secondary endpoints included the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total score, among others.

<b>About Zuranolone</b>

Zuranolone (SAGE-217/BIIB125) is a once-daily, two-week drug in development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and postpartum depression (PPD). Zuranolone is an investigational oral neuroactive steroid (NAS) GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM). The GABA system is the major inhibitory signaling pathway of the brain and central nervous system and contributes significantly to regulating brain function. Zuranolone has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration.

Zuranolone is being evaluated as a potential rapid-acting, 2-week treatment for PPD and MDD in the NEST and LANDSCAPE clinical trial programs. The programs are designed to generate data to support a potential NDA filing as efficiently as possible. If successful, LANDSCAPE and NEST may support paths to approval with three distinct opportunities to address patient needs: PPD, acute rapid response therapy (RRT) in MDD when co-initiated with a new standard antidepressant, and as-needed treatment of MDD.

Zuranolone is being evaluated as a potential rapid-acting, 2-week treatment for PPD and MDD in the NEST and LANDSCAPE clinical trial programs. The two development programs include multiple studies examining use of zuranolone in several thousand patients with a variety of dosing, clinical endpoints, and treatment paradigms. The LANDSCAPE Program includes six studies of zuranolone in patients with MDD. Data have been reported from three studies of zuranolone 30 mg in patients with MDD (MDD-201, MOUNTAIN Study and the 30 mg cohort from the ongoing SHORELINE Study), and one study of zuranolone 50 mg in patients with MDD (WATERFALL Study). Two additional studies evaluating zuranolone 50 mg in patients with MDD are expected to read out by the end of 2021 (CORAL Study and a 50mg cohort of the SHORELINE Study).

The NEST Program includes two placebo-controlled studies of zuranolone in patients with PPD. Positive data from the ROBIN Study (zuranolone 30 mg) have been previously reported. The SKYLARK Study (zuranolone 50 mg) is anticipated to readout by the end of 2021.

<b>About Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</b>

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common but serious mood disorder in which people experience depressive symptoms that impair their social, occupational, educational or other important functioning, such as a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, consistently for at least a two-week period. It is estimated that approximately 17 million people in the U.S. and more than 250 million people worldwide suffer from MDD each year. While antidepressants are widely used to treat MDD, large-scale studies have demonstrated the need for additional therapies with a differentiated profile.

<span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span> and SUZHOU, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 15, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (""Innovent"") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that the first subject has been successfully dosed in a phase 2 clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04904913) of IBI362, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucagon receptor (GCGR) dual agonist in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.

NCT04904913 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and safety of IBI362 in overweight or obese subjects in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change from baseline in body weight at week 24, and to recommend the optimal dose for phase 3 studies.

Professor <span class=""xn-person"">Linong Ji</span> from Peking University People's Hospital, the primary investigator of the study, stated: ""Obesity has become a worldwide health problem and is an important cause of several chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, respiratory and sleep disorders, as well as cancer. About 50% of type 2 diabetes cases, 30% of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and 10%-40% of cancers are caused by being obese or overweight. Obesity is also listed by the WHO as one of the top ten risk factors leading to disease burden. <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> has the largest number of overweight and obese people in the world, while there is still a lack of effective therapeutic drugs globally. The phase 1 clinical study evaluating IBI362 demonstrated a good safety profile and potential for clinically significant, weight loss and multiple metabolic benefits. We believe that IBI362 could become an important therapeutic option for obese and overweight individuals and we are excited to progress this molecule into phase 2 clinical studies .""

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Qian Lei</span>, Executive Director of Medical Sciences and Strategies of Special Diseases of Innovent, stated: ""IBI362 is a global innovative drug candidate. As an oxyntomodulin analog, IBI362 can confer dual benefits of appetite suppression and energy expenditure through the activation of GLP-1R and GCGR. Compared with traditional GLP-1 receptor agonists, IBI362 may not only achieve better weight loss, but also improve the overall metabolic health by also improving fatty liver disease and lipid metabolism in overweight or obese people. As the first weekly GLP-1R/GCGR dual agonist entering clinical trials in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, we are excited to bring this innovative therapy forward through clinical trials, to quickly bring more effective treatment options to people with obesity.""

<b>About IBI362</b>

Innovent entered into a licensing agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) for the development and potential commercialization of OXM3, a dual Glucagon and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> (IBI362). In parallel, Lilly is developing OXM3 outside <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. IBI362 is a synthetic long-acting mammalian oxyntomodulin analog (OXM3) and is a GLP-1R and GCGR dual agonist with best-in-class potential. IBI362 utilizes a fatty acyl side chain to prolong the duration of action, allowing once-weekly dosing. As an OXM analog, the effects of IBI362 are thought to be mediated through the binding and activation of GLP-1R and GCGR. In addition to the effects of GLP-1R agonists on promoting insulin secretion, lowering blood glucose and reducing body weight, IBI362 may also increase energy expenditure and improve hepatic fat metabolism through the activation of GCGR. The treatment of metabolic diseases by activating multiple metabolism-related targets simultaneously is currently the worldwide trend in drug development.

<b>About Obesity</b>

<span class=""xn-location"">China</span> has the largest obese population in the world, which shows a gradually increasing trend. Obesity can lead to a range of complications or related diseases that impact life expectancy or lead to a decrease in quality of life. In more severely obese patients, the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain tumors increase significantly. Obesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management, and there is a lack of long-term effective and safe treatments. Lifestyle intervention is the first choice and basic treatment for patients with overweight or obesity. However, a number of patients cannot achieve the desired weight loss goal due to various reasons and may use medications. Traditional anti-obesity drugs have limited weight-loss effects and safety problems.

<span class=""xn-location"">HADDONFIELD, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 15, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Linnaeus Therapeutics, Inc. (Linnaeus), a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel small molecule oncology therapeutics, today announced the expansion of its ongoing clinical collaboration with Merck to include multiple additional phase 2 cohorts. Based on promising preliminary safety, pharmacodynamic and efficacy data, this expanded agreement will allow the companies to further evaluate the combination of LNS8801 and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) in patients with selected advanced solid tumors.

LNS8801 is a first-in-class, orally bioavailable small molecule that is a highly specific and potent agonist of the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER). GPER is widely expressed on cancers.  Stimulating GPER rapidly and durably depletes the c-Myc oncoprotein, stops cancers from proliferating, and makes them more visible to the immune system.

Linnaeus and Merck are currently evaluating the combination of LNS8801 and KEYTRUDA in patients who had previously responded to PD-1/L1 therapy but have subsequently  progressed on PD-1/L1 inhibitors. Additionally, Linnaeus is currently evaluating LNS8801 as a monotherapy in patients that cannot tolerate PD-1/L1 therapy due to serious immune-related adverse events.

Under the terms of the agreement, Linnaeus will conduct six additional Phase 2 cohorts evaluating the combination of LNS8801 and KEYTRUDA in several indications including NSCLC, head and neck cancer, cutaneous and uveal melanoma, among others.

""We are very pleased to expand our collaboration with Merck, the established leader in cancer immunotherapy, as we advance LNS8801 into Phase 2 clinical trials,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Patrick Mooney</span>, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Linnaeus. ""Based on the encouraging signals we have seen so far in the advanced cancer patients treated with the combination of LNS8801 and KEYTRUDA as well as LNS8801 as monotherapy, we are optimistic that the combination of LNS8801 and KEYTRUDA will provide meaningful benefit to this patient population.""

KEYTRUDA is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp, a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., <span class=""xn-location"">Kenilworth, NJ</span>, USA.

<b>About</b><b> </b><b>LNS8801<br class=""dnr"" /></b>LNS8801 is an orally bioavailable and highly specific, potent agonist of GPER whose activity is dependent on the expression of GPER. GPER activation by LNS8801 rapidly and durably depletes c-Myc oncoprotein levels. In preclinical cancer models, LNS8801 displays potent antitumor activities across a wide range of tumor types, rapidly shrinking tumors and inducing immune memory. In the ongoing phase human 1/2a study, LNS8801 monotherapy has been safe and well tolerated. Additionally, LNS8801 has demonstrated target engagement, c-Myc oncoprotein depletion, and durable clinical benefit in patients with advanced cancer.

<p align=""left"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: JNCE), a clinical-stage company focused on the discovery and development of novel cancer immunotherapies and predictive biomarkers, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) clearance of its Investigational New Drug (IND) application for JTX-1811, an anti-CCR8 antibody, for which Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize. The IND clearance triggers a $25.0 million milestone payment to Jounce.</p>
JTX-1811, which will be referred to as GS-1811 in Gilead’s pipeline, is a monoclonal antibody created by Jounce and designed to selectively deplete immunosuppressive tumor-infiltrating T regulatory (TITR) cells. The target of JTX-1811 is CCR8, a chemokine receptor enriched on TITR cells. When JTX-1811 binds to CCR8, it targets TITR cells for depletion by enhancing an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mechanism.

“The clearance of the JTX-1811 IND marks an important and validating milestone for Jounce in our approach to cancer immunotherapy treatment. We have now been able to bring multiple novel and diversified immunotherapy development candidates into clinical development, further enhancing our opportunity to bring benefit to cancer patients who have few options. Specifically, this is our fourth internally-developed antibody in five years and is testament to the power of our discovery to early development engine” said Richard Murray, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and President of Jounce Therapeutics. “We look forward to JTX-1811’s continued advancement as Gilead progresses this program into the clinic.”

Under the terms of the September 2020 agreement, Gilead invested $35.0 million in Jounce’s common stock and made an $85.0 million upfront payment to Jounce. Jounce has led the development of JTX-1811 through IND clearance, after which Gilead now has the sole right to develop and commercialize the program. After receiving this $25.0 million milestone payment, Jounce may receive up to an additional $660.0 million in future clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and will also be eligible to receive royalties ranging from high single digit to mid-teens based upon worldwide sales. Any milestone or royalty paid to Jounce is subject to certain reductions as described in the license agreement

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <b>REGN</b>) today welcomed positive results from the largest trial assessing any monoclonal antibody treatment in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. The UK RECOVERY trial found that adding investigational REGEN-COV™ to usual care reduced the risk of death by 20% in patients who had not mounted a natural antibody response on their own against SARS-CoV-2, compared to usual care on its own.

""These results are very exciting. The hope was that by giving a combination of antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus we would be able to reduce the worst manifestations of COVID-19,"" said Sir <span class=""xn-person"">Peter Horby</span>, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, <span class=""xn-org"">University of Oxford</span>, and Joint Chief Investigator for the RECOVERY trial. ""There was, however, great uncertainty about the value of antiviral therapies in late-stage COVID-19 disease. It is wonderful to learn that even in advanced COVID-19 disease, targeting the virus can reduce mortality in patients who have failed to mount an antibody response of their own.""

RECOVERY is the first trial large enough to definitively determine whether REGEN-COV reduces mortality in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Previous Phase 3 trials in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients have shown that REGEN-COV reduced viral levels, shortened the time to resolution of symptoms and significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization or death. In a <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3198005-1&amp;h=3076482690&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fregeneron-announces-encouraging-initial-data-covid-19-antibody&amp;a=Phase+1%2F2+trial"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Phase 1/2 trial</a> in hospitalized patients, REGEN-COV also rapidly reduced viral levels, with preliminary evidence suggesting that it lowered the risk of death or receiving mechanical ventilation, with the benefit driven by patients who entered the trial without having mounted a natural antibody response of their own (seronegative); and in the absence of REGEN-COV treatment, seronegative patients had higher mortality rates than patients who had already mounted their own immune response (seropositive).

Based on the above Phase 1/2 data, the independently-run RECOVERY trial prospectively focused on seronegative patients. Similar to the prior trial, patients in RECOVERY who received usual care alone had double the mortality rate at day 28 if they were seronegative (30%) compared to seropositive (15%); approximately one-third of hospitalized patients were seronegative (n=3,153), one-half were seropositive (n=5,272) and one-sixth had unknown serostatus (n=1,360). The mean age of patients for this comparison was 62 years, and more than 90% received corticosteroids across all groups.

The primary outcome of RECOVERY showed that adding REGEN-COV 8,000 mg to usual care reduced all-cause mortality by 20% in seronegative patients (primary analysis population), compared to usual care alone (24% of patients in the REGEN-COV group died versus 30% in the usual care group by day 28; rate ratio [RR]: 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-0.91; p=0.001). When combining the larger seropositive group (as well as those with unknown status) with the seronegative patients, there was no longer a significant effect on 28-day mortality (overall 20% of patients in the REGEN-COV group died, versus 21% in the usual care group; RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.86-1.03; p=0.17).

""Definitive Phase 3 trials have now demonstrated that REGEN-COV can alter the course of COVID-19 infection from prevention, to very early infection, all the way through to when patients are on a ventilator in the hospital,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span>, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. ""We are incredibly grateful to the RECOVERY team, participating investigators and patients for conducting this in-depth analysis, and hope that the results mean that even more patients may soon be able to benefit from this life-saving medicine. We intend to rapidly discuss these results with regulatory authorities, including in the U.S. where we will ask for our EUA to be expanded to include appropriate hospitalized patients.""

Among seronegative patients in the RECOVERY trial, the median duration of hospital stay was 4 days shorter in the REGEN-COV group (13 days versus 17 days), and the proportion of patients discharged alive by day 28 was greater (64% versus 58%; RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.08-1.30). Among the seronegative patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, the risk of progressing to the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death was lower among the REGEN-COV group than the usual care group (30% versus 37%; RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.75-0.92). No such benefits were seen in the overall trial population (combining patients with negative, positive, or unknown serostatus).

""The RECOVERY trial has shown that in patients who had not made their own antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, treating them with REGEN-COV antibodies dramatically reduced their risk of dying or being on a ventilator, and also shortened how many days they remained in the hospital,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">David Weinreich</span>, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Clinical Development at Regeneron. ""The trial was conducted at a time when most patients had not been fully vaccinated. These results provide hope to patients who have a poor immune response to either the vaccine or natural infection, as well as those who are exposed to variants for whom their existing antibodies might be sub-optimal.""

Multiple analyses, including a recent publication in <i><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3198005-1&amp;h=832565809&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell%2Ffulltext%2FS0092-8674(21)00703-0&amp;a=Cell"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Cell</a></i>, have shown that REGEN-COV retains potency against the main variants of concern circulating within the U.S.; consequently, REGEN-COV remains available for use in all 50 states. REGEN-COV retains potency against variants including P.1 (first identified in <span class=""xn-location"">Brazil</span>, now classified by the World Health Organization [WHO] as Gamma), B.1.351 (first identified in <span class=""xn-location"">South Africa</span>, now classified by the WHO as Beta) and B.1.162.2 (first identified in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>, now classified by the WHO as Delta). The combined frequency of the P.1 and B.1.351 variants now exceeds 10% of new COVID-19 diagnoses across eight states (<span class=""xn-location"">Arizona</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">California</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Florida</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Illinois</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Indiana</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Massachusetts</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Oregon</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Washington</span>), and the prevalence of these and other variants continues to be closely monitored.

Between <span class=""xn-chron"">September 18, 2020</span> and <span class=""xn-chron"">May 22, 2021</span>, 9,785 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus REGEN-COV (8,000 mg by intravenous infusion) or usual care alone as part of the RECOVERY trial. Usual care was determined by individual facilities and clinicians, and could include steroids and remdesivir. Follow-up is complete for 99% of participants.

The trial involved many thousands of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and research administrators at 176 hospitals across the whole of the UK, supported by staff at the NIHR Clinical Research Network, NHS DigiTrials, Public Health England, Department of Health &amp; Social Care, the Intensive Care National Audit &amp; Research Centre, Public Health Scotland, the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage at University of <span class=""xn-location"">Swansea</span>, and the NHS in <span class=""xn-location"">England</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Scotland</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Wales</span> and Northern Ireland.

<b>About the REGEN-COV Antibody Cocktail<br class=""dnr"" /></b>REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies (also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987) that was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, using Regeneron's proprietary <i>VelocImmune<sup>®</sup></i> and <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup></i> technologies. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that form the cocktail bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus's spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in <i><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3198005-1&amp;h=2825788288&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3048827-1%26h%3D293747952%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Finvestor.regeneron.com%252Fnews-releases%252Fnews-release-details%252Ftwo-science-publications-highlight-potential-regn-cov2-anti%26a%3DScience&amp;a=Science"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Science</a></i>.

REGEN-COV can be administered by intravenous infusion (as short as 20 minutes) or by subcutaneous injection (four injections), which is an alternative when intravenous infusion is not feasible and would lead to a delay in treatment. It is now authorized as a co-formulated single vial, or in individual vials to be administered together.

In the U.S., REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy, or for people currently using chronic oxygen therapy because of an underlying comorbidity who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19.

<b>About Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune</i> Technology<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune</i> technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span> was a graduate student with his mentor <span class=""xn-person"">Frederick W. Alt</span> in 1985, they were the first to <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3198005-1&amp;h=1075602523&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2F0168952585900897&amp;a=envision"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">envision</a> making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing <i>VelocImmune</i> and related <i>VelociSuite</i> technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used <i>VelocImmune</i> technology to create approximately a quarter of all original, FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab), Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab), Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), Evkeeza<sup>®</sup> (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).

<b>Important Safety Information<br class=""dnr"" /></b>REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) is an unapproved investigational therapy, and there are limited clinical data available. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with REGEN-COV use
<ul>
 	<li><b><u>Warnings and Precautions</u></b><b>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis and Infusion-Related Reactions:</b> Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed with administration of REGEN-COV. If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions occurring more than 24 hours after the infusion have also been reported with the use of REGEN-COV under EUA. Infusion-related reactions, occurring during the infusion and up to 24 hours after the infusion, have been observed with administration of REGEN-COV. These reactions may be severe or life threatening
<ul>
 	<li><b>Signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions may include</b>: fever, difficulty breathing, reduced oxygen saturation, chills, nausea, arrythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), chest pain or discomfort, weakness, altered mental status, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, vasovagal reactions (e.g., pre-syncope, syncope), dizziness, fatigue and diaphoresis. Consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care if an infusion-related reaction occurs</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b>Clinical Worsening After REGEN-COV Administration:</b> Clinical worsening of COVID-19 after administration of REGEN-COV has been reported and may include signs or symptoms of fever, hypoxia or increased respiratory difficulty, arrythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), fatigue, and altered mental status. Some of these events required hospitalization. It is not known if these events were related to REGEN-COV use or were due to progression of COVID-19</li>
 	<li><b>Limitations of Benefit and Potential for Risk in Patients with Severe COVID-19:</b> Benefit of treatment with REGEN-COV has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as REGEN-COV, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Therefore, REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19–related comorbidity</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b><u>Adverse Reactions</u></b><b>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>In a pooled phase 1/2/3 analysis of COV-2067, infusion-related reactions (adverse event assessed as causally related by the investigator) of grade 2 or higher severity have been observed in 10/4,206 (0.2%) of those who received REGEN-COV at the authorized dose or a higher dose</li>
 	<li>Overall, in Phase 1/2/3, three subjects receiving the 8,000 mg dose of REGEN-COV, and one subject receiving the 1,200 mg casirivimab and 1,200 mg imdevimab, had infusion-related reactions (urticaria, pruritus, flushing, pyrexia, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, rash) which resulted in permanent discontinuation of the infusion. All events resolved</li>
 	<li>Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in the clinical program in subjects receiving REGEN-COV. The events began within 1 hour of completion of the infusion, and in at least one case required treatment including epinephrine. The events resolved</li>
 	<li>The safety with subcutaneous administration is based on analysis from HV-2093, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic profile in healthy volunteer adult subjects. Subjects were randomized 3:1 to REGEN-COV (n=729) or placebo (n=240). Injection site reactions were observed in 12% and 4% of subjects following single dose administration in the casirivimab and imdevimab, and placebo arms respectively; the remaining safety findings with subcutaneous administration in the casirivimab and imdevimab arm were similar to the safety findings observed with intravenous administration in COV-2067</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b><u>Patient Monitoring Recommendations</u></b>: Clinically monitor patients during infusion and observe patients for at least 1 hour after intravenous infusion or subcutaneous dosing is complete</li>
 	<li><b><u>Use in Specific Populations</u></b><b>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Pregnancy:</b> There are insufficient data to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. REGEN-COV should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus</li>
 	<li><b>Lactation:</b> There are no available data on the presence of casirivimab and/or imdevimab in human milk or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for REGEN-COV and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from REGEN-COV or from the underlying maternal condition</li>
</ul>

MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Organicell Regenerative Medicine, Inc. (OTCMKTS: BPSR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of regenerative therapies, today announced the outcome of their expanded access (EA) intermediate size patient population trial (NCT04657406) which:
<div class=""bw-release-story"">
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Met endpoints for safety and efficacy in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19</li>
 	<li>Mitigated mild and moderate symptoms</li>
 	<li>Improved pulmonary opacities detected in chest X-rays</li>
 	<li>Improved inflammatory biomarkers</li>
</ul>
The trial was conducted at United Memorial Medical Center (UMMC) in Houston, TX. The administration of Zofin<sup>TM</sup> was well tolerated in all enrolled subjects, with no adverse events. Chest X-ray data demonstrated that 75% of subjects had bilateral opacities caused by COVID-19 infection at day 0 (baseline), prior to Zofin<sup>TM</sup> treatment. Thirty days after Zofin<sup>TM</sup> treatment, chest X-ray data showed 83% of treated subjects had normal lung imaging, indicating complete recovery. There was also a significant decrease in biomarker levels like CRP, IL-6, and TNF-a at day 14, 21, and 30 when compared to the respective control with p-values less than p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively. Organicell intends to submit results for scientific peer review and publication.

Organicell will immediately submit this data to the FDA for a requested amendment to their approved IND (NCT04384445) to perform a placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial to confirm safety and efficacy in a randomized fashion.

“There are only a few evidence-based treatments for acute COVID-19 that are appropriate for use in the outpatient setting. We are extremely pleased by the outcome of this analysis, which provides strong evidence that Zofin<sup>TM</sup> may be an effective treatment for patients who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, hospitalization, or both if no treatment is given,” said Vincent Friedewald, MD, FACC, FACP, Primary Investigator at UMMC, Houston, TX.

“The study results mark an important step in our journey to bring forward a biological drug capable of helping end this devastating pandemic,” said Mari Mitrani, M.D. Ph.D., Chief Science Officer of Organicell.

DEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The full results from the RELIEF study were published today in <i>The Journal of the American Medical Association</i> (JAMA). VYEPTI® (eptinezumab-jjmr) met both co-primary endpoints, showing early benefit for time to headache pain freedom, and time to the absence of most bothersome symptoms (MBS), compared to placebo. Patients treated with VYEPTI experienced headache pain freedom and absence of their MBS at 2 hours post-infusion, achieving the key secondary endpoints. The RELIEF study evaluated how preventive migraine candidates may benefit from a VYEPTI infusion during an active migraine attack when administered within 1 to 6 hours of a moderate to severe migraine attack. VYEPTI is the first and only intravenous (IV) infusion approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“Historically, patients with migraine have had to wait several weeks for the effect of their preventive medications to manifest,” says Paul Winner, D.O., Director of the Palm Beach Headache Center, and one of the lead authors of the study. “The RELIEF data in <i>JAMA</i> validates that treatment with VYEPTI in the midst of a migraine attack may mitigate the duration and most bothersome symptoms associated with the current attack, while still providing the therapeutic benefit of preventing future attacks. Furthermore, an active migraine would not be an obstacle for initiating preventive treatment with VYEPTI.”

Patients receiving a 100 mg VYEPTI infusion during a migraine attack achieved co-primary endpoints of the time to freedom from headache pain (hazard ratio [HR]=1.54, p&lt;0.001) and time to absence of their MBS (HR=1.75, p&lt;0.001) earlier than placebo. Patients receiving VYEPTI reported a median time to headache pain freedom of 4 hours vs. 9 hours among those who received placebo, and a median time of 2 hours to the absence of their MBS vs. 3 hours with placebo.

The key secondary endpoints met statistical significance, demonstrating that at 2 hours after the start of the infusion, headache pain freedom was reported by 23.5% patients receiving VYEPTI and 12.0% receiving placebo (p&lt;0.001), while absence of MBS was reported by 55.5% patients receiving VYEPTI and 35.8% receiving placebo (p&lt;0.001). The exploratory endpoint of time to next migraine was met (10 days with VYEPTI vs. 5 days with placebo).

Consistent with previous pivotal trials, VYEPTI was well-tolerated in the RELIEF study with similar rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) seen vs. placebo. In the RELIEF study, TEAE occurred in 10.9% of VYEPTI group and 10.3% of the placebo group. The most frequently reported TEAE in the VYEPTI group was hypersensitivity, 2.1% vs. none in the placebo group.

“We purposefully designed the RELIEF study with the knowledge that patients experiencing high-frequency of migraine attacks could have an active migraine when administered preventive treatment with VYEPTI,” said Roger Cady, M.D., Vice President of Neurology at Lundbeck. “In the RELIEF study, administering VYEPTI during an active migraine resolved headache and migraine-associated symptoms, and extended the time to the next migraine attack vs. placebo. These data provide important insights into the spectrum of therapeutic needs of patients experiencing frequent migraine episodes.”

<b>About the RELIEF Study Publication in <i>JAMA</i></b>

The RELIEF study (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04152083&amp;esheet=52442811&amp;newsitemid=20210615005760&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT04152083&amp;index=2&amp;md5=0d35c2b42668e28a27b24704606bd712"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT04152083</a>) is a parallel group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of VYEPTI, initiated within 1-6 hours of the onset of a migraine attack in adult patients who are candidates for preventive therapy, experiencing 4 to 15 migraine days per month. Subjects were randomized to receive a single 100 mg dose of VYEPTI or placebo in a 1:1 ratio (n=480) administered via a 30-minute IV infusion.

The RELIEF study met co-primary endpoints of time to headache pain freedom (HR 1.54, p&lt;0.001) and time to absence of MBS (HR 1.75, p&lt;0.001) for VYEPTI-treated patients, compared with placebo. Most Bothersome Symptoms (MBS) include nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Patients receiving VYEPTI reported a median time to freedom from headache pain of 4 hours vs. 9 hours among those who received placebo and a median time of 2 hours to the absence of their MBS vs. 3 hours with placebo.

Participants treated with VYEPTI vs. placebo met statistical significance on all secondary endpoints, including:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Headache pain freedom: </b>23.5% vs. 12%, respectively, achieved headache pain freedom (p&lt;0.001) at 2 hours post-treatment. This benefit was maintained 4 hours post-treatment (46.6% vs. 26.4%, respectively)</li>
 	<li><b>Absence of MBS: </b>55.5% vs. 35.8%, respectively, experienced an absence of MBS (p&lt;0.001) at 2 hours post-treatment. This benefit was maintained at 4 hours post-treatment (65.1% vs. 37.5%, respectively)</li>
 	<li><b>Use of rescue medication: </b>Fewer VYEPTI-treated patients (31.5%) vs. placebo (59.9%) required rescue medications within 24 hours of treatment</li>
</ul>
Safety and tolerability of VYEPTI administered during a migraine attack were also assessed and were comparable to the safety data from two phase III pivotal studies, PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2. The most common adverse reactions (=2% and at least 2% or greater than placebo) in the clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine were nasopharyngitis and hypersensitivity.

<b>About VYEPTI®</b>

VYEPTI<b>®</b> (eptinezumab-jjmr) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand and blocks its binding to the receptor. VYEPTI was deliberately developed for administration by IV infusion to deliver 100 percent of the medication into the bloodstream at the end of the infusion.

The efficacy and safety of VYEPTI were demonstrated in two phase III clinical trials, PROMISE 1 in episodic migraine and PROMISE 2 in chronic migraine. VYEPTI met its primary endpoint of decrease in mean monthly migraine days (MMD) over months 1-3 in both episodic and chronic migraine. The safety of VYEPTI was evaluated in 2,076 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of VYEPTI. The most common adverse reactions (=2 percent and at least 2 percent or greater than placebo) in the clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine were nasopharyngitis and hypersensitivity. In PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2, 1.9 percent of patients treated with VYEPTI discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.

Administered as one 30-minute IV infusion every 3 months, VYEPTI offers patients with migraine a preventive therapy with 4 infusions a year. The recommended dosage is 100 mg, and some patients may benefit from a dosage of 300 mg. Dosing should be based on the guidance in the Prescribing Information and Patient Information.

VYEPTI was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults in<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accessdata.fda.gov%2Fscripts%2Fcder%2Fdaf%2Findex.cfm%3Fevent%3Doverview.process%26ApplNo%3D761119&amp;esheet=52442811&amp;newsitemid=20210615005760&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=February+2020&amp;index=3&amp;md5=15ad41ff8bc942e9ee27d9ca6739bbca"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> February 2020</a>.

<b>About Migraine</b>

Migraine is an incapacitating neurological disease characterized by recurrent episodes of severe headaches typically accompanied by an array of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound. It is estimated to affect approximately 39 million people in the U.S., more than 1 billion worldwide, and impacts three times as many women than men. It is the second leading cause of years lived with disability (YLD) among all diseases, and is the top YLD cause among patients aged 15 to 49 years, according to the Global Burden of Disease study. Migraine has a profound impact on patients’ lives, their relationships, as well as their ability to carry out activities of daily living. More than 157 million workdays are lost each year in the U.S. due to migraine.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and The Academic Research Organization (ARO) from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein today announced that the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> has published positive findings from the STOP-COVID study (NCT04469114) evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib in 289 hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were not on ventilation.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

The trial was a research collaboration between Pfizer and the ARO from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo, Brazil, which was the trial coordinating center. It is important to note that tofacitinib has not been approved or authorized for use by any regulatory authority worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19 and tofacitinib should not be used in patients with an active serious infection.

The trial demonstrated a lower cumulative incidence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 – the primary outcome of the study – with tofacitinib (18.1%) compared to placebo (29.0%) (risk ratio 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.97; p=0.04). Death from any cause through day 28 occurred in 2.8% of patients in the tofacitinib group and in 5.5% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.63).

Serious adverse events occurred in 20 patients (14.1%) in the tofacitinib group and 17 (12.0%) in the placebo group. Among protocol-specified adverse events of special interest, deep vein thrombosis, acute myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and myocarditis occurred in one patient each in the tofacitinib group; hemorrhagic stroke and cardiogenic shock occurred in one patient each in the placebo group. The incidence of serious infection was 3.5% in the tofacitinib group and 4.2% in the placebo group.

“We are encouraged by the initial findings of our randomized trial of tofacitinib in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. These results provide new information which indicates that the use of tofacitinib when added to standard of care, which includes glucocorticoids, may further reduce the risk of death or respiratory failure in this patient population,” said Otavio Berwanger, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Academic Research Organization, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. “The study builds on the hypothesis that JAK inhibition could mitigate systemic and alveolar inflammation in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia.”

“To effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains a critical need for multiple therapeutic options to treat patients who have contracted the virus,” said Tamas Koncz, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, Pfizer Inflammation &amp; Immunology. “As outlined in <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpfizer-outlines-five-point-plan-battle-covid-19&amp;esheet=52446376&amp;newsitemid=20210616005998&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Pfizer%26%238217%3Bs+five-point+plan&amp;index=2&amp;md5=b6e0ef4cc53475329b993c6da547d002"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Pfizer’s five-point plan</a> at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are keenly focused on working across the healthcare ecosystem with partners like Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. We look forward to our continued collaboration as we analyze the full dataset from this study and assess next steps.”

The multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard of care. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily plus standard of care or placebo twice daily plus standard of care for up to 14 days or until hospital discharge. Overall, 89.3% used glucocorticoids during hospitalization, predominantly dexamethasone.

<b>About XELJANZ<sup>®</sup> (tofacitinib)</b>

XELJANZ<sup>®</sup> (tofacitinib) is<b> </b>approved in the U.S. in four indications: adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after methotrexate failure, adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) after disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) failure, adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) after tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) failure and patients 2 years of age or older with active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA). See Limitations of Use below.

XELJANZ has been studied in more than 50 clinical trials worldwide, including more than 20 trials in RA patients, and prescribed to over 300,000 adult patients (the majority of whom were RA patients) worldwide since 2012.<sup>i,ii,iii </sup>As the developer of tofacitinib, Pfizer is committed to advancing the science of JAK inhibition and enhancing understanding of tofacitinib through robust clinical development programs in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory conditions.

Pfizer recently <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpfizer-shares-co-primary-endpoint-results-post-marketing&amp;esheet=52446376&amp;newsitemid=20210616005998&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=communicated&amp;index=4&amp;md5=bd4031d62eea41ee701b2512dfee5791"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">communicated</a> an increased rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) for XELJANZ relative to anti-TNF therapy in RA patients who were 50 years of age or older and had at least one additional cardiovascular (CV) risk factor. Pfizer is continuing to work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and other regulatory agencies to review the full results and analysis.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</b>

<b>Patients treated with XELJANZ* are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.</b>

<b>If a serious infection develops, interrupt XELJANZ until the infection is controlled.</b>

<b>Reported infections include:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before XELJANZ use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to XELJANZ use.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.</b></li>
</ul>
The most common serious infections reported with XELJANZ included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract infection, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Avoid use of XELJANZ in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections, or with chronic or recurrent infection.

In the UC* population, XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of serious infections compared to 5 mg twice daily. Opportunistic herpes zoster infections (including meningoencephalitis, ophthalmologic, and disseminated cutaneous) were seen in patients who were treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily.

<b>The risks and benefits of treatment with XELJANZ should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection, </b>or those who have lived or traveled in areas of endemic TB or mycoses. Viral reactivation including herpes virus and hepatitis B reactivation have been reported. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy.

<b>Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XELJANZ, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.</b>

Caution is also recommended in patients with a history of chronic lung disease, or in those who develop interstitial lung disease, as they may be more prone to infection.

<b>MORTALITY</b>

<b>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<sup>†</sup> patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular (CV) risk factor treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day had a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden CV death, compared to those treated with XELJANZ 5 mg given twice daily or TNF blockers in a large, ongoing, postmarketing safety study. </b>XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA<sup>‡</sup>. For UC, use XELJANZ at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response.

<b>MALIGNANCIES</b>

<b>Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with XELJANZ. Epstein Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder has been observed at an increased rate in renal transplant patients treated with XELJANZ and concomitant immunosuppressive medications.</b>

Consider the risks and benefits of XELJANZ treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing XELJANZ in patients who develop a malignancy.

Malignancies (including solid cancers and lymphomas) were observed more often in patients treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily dosing in the UC long-term extension study.

Other malignancies were observed in clinical studies and the post-marketing setting including, but not limited to, lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. NMSCs have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. In the UC population, treatment with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of NMSC. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

<b>THROMBOSIS</b>

<b>Thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis, have occurred in patients treated with XELJANZ and other Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. RA patients who were 50 years of age and older with at least one CV risk factor treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily compared to XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily or TNF blockers in a large, ongoing postmarketing safety study had an observed increase in incidence of these events. Many of these events were serious and some resulted in death. Avoid XELJANZ in patients at risk. Discontinue XELJANZ and promptly evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis. For patients with UC, use XELJANZ at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response. </b>XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA. In a long-term extension study in UC, four cases of pulmonary embolism were reported in patients taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, including one death in a patient with advanced cancer.<b></b>

<b>GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS</b>

Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in XELJANZ clinical trials, although the role of JAK inhibition is not known. In these studies, many patients with rheumatoid arthritis were receiving background therapy with Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). There was no discernable difference in frequency of gastrointestinal perforation between the placebo and the XELJANZ arms in clinical trials of patients with UC, and many of them were receiving background corticosteroids. XELJANZ should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis or taking NSAIDs).

<b>HYPERSENSITIVITY</b>

Angioedema and urticaria that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving XELJANZ and some events were serious. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue tofacitinib while evaluating the potential cause or causes of the reaction.

<b>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES</b>

<b>Lymphocyte Abnormalities: </b>Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with initial lymphocytosis at one month of exposure followed by a gradual decrease in mean lymphocyte counts. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a count less than 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. In patients who develop a confirmed absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended. Risk of infection may be higher with increasing degrees of lymphopenia and consideration should be given to lymphocyte counts when assessing individual patient risk of infection. Monitor lymphocyte counts at baseline and every 3 months thereafter.

<b>Neutropenia: </b>Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than 2000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with an ANC less than 1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. For patients who develop a persistent ANC of 500-1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, interrupt XELJANZ dosing until ANC is greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. In patients who develop an ANC less than 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended. Monitor neutrophil counts at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.

<b>Anemia: </b>Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a hemoglobin level less than 9 g/dL. Treatment with XELJANZ should be interrupted in patients who develop hemoglobin levels less than 8 g/dL or whose hemoglobin level drops greater than 2 g/dL on treatment. Monitor hemoglobin at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.

<b>Liver Enzyme Elevations: </b>Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Most of these abnormalities occurred in studies with background DMARD (primarily methotrexate) therapy. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, the administration of XELJANZ should be interrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded. Routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of the causes of liver enzyme elevations is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury.

<b>Lipid Elevations: </b>Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Maximum effects were generally observed within 6 weeks. There were no clinically relevant changes in LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios. Manage patients with hyperlipidemia according to clinical guidelines. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 4-8 weeks following initiation of XELJANZ therapy.

<b>VACCINATIONS</b>

Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with XELJANZ. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of tofacitinib therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ therapy.

<b>PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL NARROWING</b>

Caution should be used when administering XELJANZ XR to patients with pre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing. There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs utilizing a non-deformable extended release formulation.

<b>HEPATIC and RENAL IMPAIRMENT</b>

Use of XELJANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.

For patients with moderate hepatic impairment or with moderate or severe renal impairment taking XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, reduce to XELJANZ 5 mg once daily.

For UC patients with moderate hepatic impairment or with moderate or severe renal impairment taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, reduce to XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>

The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections. The most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first 3 months in controlled clinical trials in patients with RA with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and placebo, respectively, (occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with XELJANZ with or without DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, and hypertension. The safety profile observed in patients with active PsA treated with XELJANZ was consistent with the safety profile observed in RA patients.

Adverse reactions reported in =5% of patients treated with either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and =1% greater than reported in patients receiving placebo in either the induction or maintenance clinical trials for UC were: nasopharyngitis, elevated cholesterol levels, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, rash, diarrhea, and herpes zoster.

<b>USE IN PREGNANCY</b>

Available data with XELJANZ use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with rheumatoid arthritis and UC in pregnancy. In animal studies, tofacitinib at 6.3 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily demonstrated adverse embryo-fetal findings. The relevance of these findings to women of childbearing potential is uncertain. Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential.

<span class=""xn-location"">SILVER SPRING, Md.</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 16, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- United Therapeutics Corporation (Nasdaq: UTHR) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (<b>FDA</b>) accepted for priority review the New Drug Application (<b>NDA</b>) for Tyvaso DPI™ (inhaled treprostinil) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (<b>PAH</b>) and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (<b>PH-ILD</b>). United Therapeutics expects the agency's review to be complete in <span class=""xn-chron"">October 2021</span>. FDA also indicated that they have not identified any potential review issues at this time.

Tyvaso DPI is a next-generation dry powder formulation of Tyvaso. If approved, Tyvaso DPI is expected to provide a more convenient method of administration as compared with traditional nebulized Tyvaso therapy.

""The acceptance of the Tyvaso DPI NDA for review represents an important regulatory step toward offering this meaningful new product to both PAH and PH-ILD patients,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Martine Rothblatt</span>, Ph.D., Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer of United Therapeutics. ""If approved, Tyvaso DPI will represent yet another path to help us achieve our goal of serving 25,000 patients by the end of 2025.""

The NDA includes <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3197920-1&amp;h=2915590556&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.unither.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Fpress-release-details%2F2021%2FUnited-Therapeutics-Announces-BREEZE-Study-of-Investigational-Tyvaso-DPI-Meets-Primary-Objective%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;a=data"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">data</a> from the <i>BREEZE </i>study that demonstrated safety and tolerability of Tyvaso DPI in patients with PAH transitioning from Tyvaso<sup>®</sup> (treprostinil) Inhalation Solution. A separate study in healthy volunteers demonstrated comparable treprostinil exposure between Tyvaso DPI and Tyvaso Inhalation Solution.

In its communications with United Therapeutics, the FDA indicated that approval of the NDA will be subject to an inspection of the Tyvaso DPI manufacturing facility operated by MannKind Corporation; FDA and MannKind have jointly targeted the third quarter of 2021 to complete the inspection.

<b><u>About Tyvaso DPI™</u></b>

Tyvaso DPI™ is an investigational drug-device combination therapy comprised of a dry powder formulation of treprostinil and a small, portable, dry powder inhaler. If approved, Tyvaso DPI is expected to provide a more convenient method of administration compared with traditional nebulized Tyvaso<sup>®</sup> therapy. United Therapeutics is developing Tyvaso DPI under a collaboration and license agreement with MannKind Corporation (Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-therapeutics-announces-fda-acceptance-of-tyvaso-dpi-new-drug-application-for-priority-review-301313312.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">MNKD</a>). Tyvaso DPI incorporates the dry powder formulation technology and Dreamboat<sup>®</sup> inhalation device technology used in MannKind's Afrezza<sup>®</sup> (insulin human) Inhalation Powder product, which was approved by the FDA in 2014.

United Therapeutics and MannKind are also developing BluHale<sup>®</sup>, a Bluetooth-connected accessory for the Tyvaso DPI inhaler with a companion mobile application intended to help the patient track information about inhaler use.

<b><u>About the <i>BREEZE </i>and healthy volunteer PK studies</u></b>

The <i>BREEZE</i> study was a single-sequence study in which 51 subjects on a stable regimen of Tyvaso Inhalation Solution were transitioned to Tyvaso DPI at a corresponding treprostinil dose. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Tyvaso DPI during a three-week treatment phase in PAH patients previously treated with Tyvaso Inhalation Solution.

Secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate: (1) the systemic exposure and pharmacokinetics of treprostinil when delivered as Tyvaso Inhalation Solution and Tyvaso DPI; (2) six-minute walk distance (<b>6MWD</b>) at study entry and after three weeks of treatment with Tyvaso DPI; (3) the long-term safety and tolerability of Tyvaso DPI during an optional extension phase (<b>OEP</b>) in patients previously treated with Tyvaso Inhalation Solution; (4) patient satisfaction with and preference for inhaled treprostinil devices assessed at study entry when patients were using Tyvaso Inhalation Solution and after three weeks using Tyvaso DPI; and (5) patient-reported PAH symptoms and impact (<b>PAH-SYMPACT<sup>®</sup></b>) assessed at study entry when patients were using Tyvaso Inhalation Solution and after three weeks using Tyvaso DPI.

<b>Primary safety and tolerability objective. </b>Transition from Tyvaso Inhalation Solution to Tyvaso DPI was safe and well tolerated. Forty-nine out of 51 patients (96%) completed the treatment phase and there were no study drug related adverse events. Most adverse events experienced during the study were mild to moderate in severity and occurred at severities and frequencies consistent with those seen in other inhaled treprostinil studies in patients with PAH.

<b>Secondary objectives. </b>Three weeks after switching from Tyvaso Inhalation Solution to Tyvaso DPI, patients in the <i>BREEZE</i> study demonstrated:
<ul>
 	<li>Improvements in 6MWD compared to baseline. These improvements in 6MWD compared to baseline were sustained in the OEP through the data cut-off date.</li>
 	<li>Improvements in overall satisfaction with the Tyvaso DPI inhaler compared to the Tyvaso Inhalation Solution nebulizer at baseline using an internally developed satisfaction and preference questionnaire.</li>
 	<li>Improvement in patient-reported outcomes using the validated PAH-SYMPACT questionnaire.</li>
</ul>
<b>Optional extension phase. </b>Subjects in <i>BREEZE</i> were given the opportunity to continue in an OEP. All subjects who completed the treatment phase (49/51) elected to continue in the OEP.

<b><i>BREEZE</i></b><b> PK observations.</b> The <i>BREEZE</i> study demonstrated comparable PK between Tyvaso Inhalation Solution and Tyvaso DPI in PAH patients.

Detailed data from the <i>BREEZE</i> study will be presented in upcoming publications and scientific conferences.

<b>Healthy volunteer PK study.</b> The healthy volunteer pharmacokinetic (<b>PK</b>) study was a randomized six-period, six-sequence crossover study of three dose levels of Tyvaso DPI and three dose levels of Tyvaso Inhalation Solution in 36 healthy volunteers. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the systemic exposure and PK of treprostinil administered as Tyvaso DPI and Tyvaso Inhalation Solution. Secondary objectives of the study evaluated the safety and tolerability of Tyvaso DPI.

<b>Study results. </b>Subjects demonstrated comparable systemic treprostinil exposure for each corresponding Tyvaso DPI and Tyvaso Inhalation Solution dose level. Between-subject variability for both AUC<sub>0-5h</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> was approximately 50% less for Tyvaso DPI compared to Tyvaso Inhalation Solution, suggesting a more precise dosing profile for Tyvaso DPI relative to nebulized Tyvaso.

<b>Safety. </b>The adverse event profile for Tyvaso DPI in healthy volunteers was consistent with known prostacyclin effects and previous studies of Tyvaso Inhalation Solution.

Detailed data from the healthy volunteer PK study will be presented in upcoming publications and scientific conferences.

<b><u>About PH-ILD</u></b>

Interstitial lung disease (<b>ILD</b>) is a group of lung diseases that are characterized by significant scarring or fibrosis of the bronchioles and alveolar sacs within the lungs. Increased fibrotic tissue in ILD prevents oxygenation and free gas exchange between the pulmonary capillaries and alveolar sacs, and the condition can present with a wide range of symptoms, including shortness of breath with activity, labored breathing and fatigue. Pulmonary hypertension (<b>PH</b>) frequently complicates the course of patients with interstitial lung disease and is associated with worse functional status measured by exercise capacity, greater supplemental oxygen needs, decreased quality of life, and worse outcomes.

An estimated 30,000 patients in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> may suffer from PH-ILD, which is included within Group 3 of the World Health Organization (<b>WHO</b>) classification of PH. Only Tyvaso Inhalation Solution is approved to treat patients with this disease.

<b><u>About PAH</u></b>

Also known as World Health Organization (<b>WHO</b>) Group 1 Pulmonary Hypertension, Pulmonary arterial hypertension (<b>PAH</b>) is life-threatening high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs, affecting the ability of the heart and lungs to work properly in afflicted patients. PAH is a serious, progressive disease for which there is no cure.

<b><u>About TYVASO<sup>®</sup> (treprostinil) Inhalation Solution</u></b>

INDICATION

TYVASO (treprostinil) is a prostacyclin mimetic indicated for the treatment of:
<ul>
 	<li>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing effectiveness predominately included patients with NYHA Functional Class III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (56%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (33%). <br class=""dnr"" /> <br class=""dnr"" />The effects diminish over the minimum recommended dosing interval of 4 hours; treatment timing can be adjusted for planned activities. <br class=""dnr"" /> <br class=""dnr"" />While there are long-term data on use of treprostinil by other routes of administration, nearly all controlled clinical experience with inhaled treprostinil has been on a background of bosentan (an endothelin receptor antagonist) or sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor). The controlled clinical experience was limited to 12 weeks in duration.<br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li>Pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD; WHO Group 3) to improve exercise ability. The study establishing effectiveness predominately included patients with etiologies of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) (45%) inclusive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) (25%), and WHO Group 3 connective tissue disease (22%).</li>
</ul>
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
<ul>
 	<li>TYVASO is a pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. In patients with low systemic arterial pressure, TYVASO may produce symptomatic hypotension.</li>
 	<li>TYVASO inhibits platelet aggregation and increases the risk of bleeding.</li>
 	<li>Co-administration of a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor (e.g., gemfibrozil) may increase exposure (both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of a CYP2C8 enzyme inducer (e.g., rifampin) may decrease exposure to treprostinil. Increased exposure is likely to increase adverse events associated with treprostinil administration, whereas decreased exposure is likely to reduce clinical effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
DRUG INTERACTIONS/SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
<ul>
 	<li>The concomitant use of TYVASO with diuretics, antihypertensives, or other vasodilators may increase the risk of symptomatic hypotension.</li>
 	<li>Human pharmacokinetic studies with an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diolamine) indicated that co-administration of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor, gemfibrozil, increases exposure (both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer, rifampin, decreases exposure to treprostinil. It is unclear if the safety and efficacy of treprostinil by the inhalation route are altered by inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8.</li>
 	<li>Limited case reports of treprostinil use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. However, pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal mortality. There are no data on the presence of treprostinil in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.</li>
 	<li>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</li>
 	<li>Across clinical studies used to establish the effectiveness of TYVASO in patients with PAH and PH–ILD, 268 (47.8%) patients aged 65 years and over were enrolled. The treatment effects and safety profile observed in geriatric patients were similar to younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of hepatic, renal, or cardiac dysfunction, and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.</li>
</ul>
ADVERSE REACTIONS
<ul>
 	<li><u>Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (WHO Group 1)<br class=""dnr"" /></u>In a 12-week, placebo-controlled study (TRIUMPH I) of 235 patients with PAH (WHO Group 1 and nearly all NYHA Functional Class III), the most common adverse reactions seen with TYVASO in =4% of PAH patients and more than 3% greater than placebo in the placebo-controlled study were cough (54% vs 29%), headache (41% vs 23%), throat irritation/pharyngolaryngeal pain (25% vs 14%), nausea (19% vs 11%), flushing (15% vs &lt;1%), and syncope (6% vs &lt;1%). In addition, adverse reactions occurring in =4% of patients were dizziness and diarrhea.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

CureVac N.V. (Nasdaq: CVAC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines based on messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”), today announced results of the second interim analysis of its international pivotal Phase 2b/3 study in approximatively 40,000 subjects (the HERALD study) of CureVac’s first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CVnCoV. In the unprecedented context of at least 13 variants circulating within the study population subset assessed at this interim analysis, CVnCoV demonstrated an interim vaccine efficacy of 47% against COVID-19 disease of any severity and did not meet prespecified statistical success criteria. Initial analyses suggest age and strain dependent efficacy. Available data were communicated with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) confirmed a favorable safety profile for CVnCoV. The study is continuing to the final analysis and the totality of the data will be assessed for the most appropriate regulatory pathway.

In total, 134 Covid-19 cases were assessed in this interim analysis. Out of these cases, 124 were sequenced to identify the variant causing the infection. The outcome confirms that only one single case was attributable to the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. More than half of the cases (57%) were caused by Variants of Concern. Most of the remaining cases were caused by other less characterised variants such as Lambda or C.37, first identified in Peru (21%) and B.1.621, first identified in Colombia (7%). In this context, the interim results suggest efficacy in younger participants but did not allow to conclude on efficacy in the age group above 60.

“While we were hoping for a stronger interim outcome, we recognize that demonstrating high efficacy in this unprecedented broad diversity of variants is challenging. As we are continuing toward the final analysis with a minimum of 80 additional cases, the overall vaccine efficacy may change,” said Dr. Franz-Werner Haas, Chief Executive Officer of CureVac. “In addition, the variant-rich environment underlines the importance of developing next-generation vaccines as new virus variants continue to emerge.”

The HERALD study, conducted by Curevac in conjunction with Bayer, enrolled approximately 40,000 participants in ten countries in Latin America and Europe. The second interim analysis included 134 cases, occurring at least two weeks after administration of the second dose. To identify strains causing COVID-19 infections within the trial, sequencing of virus variants has so far been performed on 424 COVID-19 cases, of which 124 fulfilled adjudication criteria and were included in the present efficacy analysis.

CureVac remains committed to COVID-19 vaccine development. Beyond CVnCoV, the company develops in partnership with GSK second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidates. These candidates are based on new mRNA backbones and include potential variants in multivalent vaccine formats as well as combination vaccines for potential protection against multiple infectious diseases in one vaccine. Preclinical data from the first vaccine candidate, CV2CoV, has recently been accepted for publication in Nature Communications. CureVac and GSK expect to progress the second-generation vaccine candidate into clinical testing in the third quarter of 2021, with the goal of introducing the vaccine in 2022, subject to regulatory approval.

CureVac will also host a webcast and conference call on Thursday, June 17, 2021 at 2:00 p.m. CET / 8:00 a.m. EST. The live conference call dial-in details and webcast link can be accessed via the Investor Relations section of the CureVac website at <a href=""https://www.curevac.com/en/newsroom/events/"">https://www.curevac.com/en/newsroom/events/</a>

CureVac began development of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates in January 2020. The vaccine candidate chosen for first clinical development, CVnCoV, is an optimized, non-chemically modified mRNA, encoding the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and formulated within Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs). Phase 1 and 2a clinical trials of CVnCoV began in June and September 2020, respectively. Phase 1 interim data reported in November 2020 showed that CVnCoV was generally well tolerated across all tested doses and induced strong antibody responses in addition to first indication of T cell activation. The quality of the immune response was comparable to recovered COVID-19 patients, closely mimicking the immune response after natural COVID-19 infection. A pivotal Phase 2b/3, the HERALD study, with a 12µg dose of CVnCoV was initiated in December 2020. In February 2021, CureVac initiated a rolling submission with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for CVnCoV.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Blueprint Medicines Corporation (NASDAQ: BPMC) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved AYVAKIT™ (avapritinib) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (Advanced SM), including aggressive SM (ASM), SM with an associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) and mast cell leukemia (MCL). For the first time, advanced SM patients can now receive a targeted therapy designed to potently and selectively inhibit D816V mutant KIT, the central driver of the disease.

“Today’s approval of AYVAKIT for advanced systemic mastocytosis – the fourth FDA approval across our portfolio in 18 months – culminates nearly a decade of hard work, from our scientists in the laboratory and clinical team conducting trials, to our commercial organization who will now bring AYVAKIT to patients,” said Jeff Albers, Chief Executive Officer of Blueprint Medicines. “As shown in two clinical trials, AYVAKIT provides remarkable clinical efficacy to patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, and this approval solidifies the therapy’s strong value proposition in this population. With a deep commitment to driving continued research innovation in collaboration with the mast cell disease community, we are now building on this progress with the goal of bringing the benefits of precision therapy to a broader range of patients through our ongoing and planned clinical trials for non-advanced systemic mastocytosis.”

SM is a rare hematologic disorder caused by the KIT D816V mutation in nearly all cases. Across advanced SM subtypes, the median overall survival is approximately 3.5 years in ASM, approximately two years in SM-AHN and less than six months in MCL.1

“Advanced systemic mastocytosis is a debilitating disease characterized by extensive damage in multiple organ systems due to mast cell infiltration, and new treatment options are urgently needed to address these life-threatening complications,” said Daniel DeAngelo, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Division of Leukemia at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “Avapritinib will clearly establish a new standard of care for patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis. The FDA approval was based on data showing robust and durable responses, including complete remissions, and a favorable safety profile. For advanced SM patients, the approval of avapritinib shifts the treatment paradigm toward precision therapy that targets the primary driver of mastocytosis.”

The FDA granted full approval to AYVAKIT for adults with advanced SM based on data from the Phase 1 EXPLORER trial and Phase 2 PATHFINDER trial.2 Treatment response was evaluated using modified IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, with assessments based on at least 12 weeks of response duration, resolution of at least one finding of non-hematologic and hematologic organ damage, and 50 percent or greater reductions in biomarker response, mast cell burden and serum tryptase. The overall response rate (ORR) in the U.S. prescribing information is defined as complete remission with full or partial hematologic recovery (CR/CRh), or partial remission (PR).

AYVAKIT showed durable clinical efficacy in advanced SM patients across disease subtypes and regardless of prior therapy. In 53 evaluable patients who had a median follow-up of 11.6 months, the ORR was 57 percent (95% CI: 42%, 70%), and the proportion of patients with CR/CRh (28 percent), PR (28 percent) and clinical improvement (15 percent) is in line with previously reported results. The median duration of response was 38.3 months (95% CI: 19 months, not estimable). Warnings and precautions include intracranial hemorrhage, cognitive effects and embryo-fetal toxicity. AYVAKIT is not recommended for the treatment of patients with advanced SM with low platelet counts (less than 50,000/µL), which is consistent with current patient eligibility criteria in the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials. The most common adverse reactions were edema, diarrhea, nausea and fatigue/asthenia.

“People with advanced systemic mastocytosis face a scary, uncertain future due to life-threatening complications of the disease, as well as debilitating symptoms that often profoundly alter their ability to perform daily activities, and the FDA approval of a new therapy, AYVAKIT, brings much needed hope to these patients,” said Valerie Slee, Board Chair of The Mast Cell Disease Society.

“This milestone is also the culmination of many years of work across the systemic mastocytosis community, and we’re proud of the contributions The Mast Cell Disease Society has made to improve the understanding of this disease, pioneer new approaches to measuring the impact of therapeutic interventions, and support the development of important medicines like AYVAKIT,” said Lauren Denton, Executive Director of The Mast Cell Disease Society. “We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Blueprint Medicines, scientific and clinical experts, and other stakeholders across our community to improve diagnosis, treatment and care for all patients living with systemic mastocytosis.”

Blueprint Medicines is committed to advancing precision therapies for the benefit of SM patients. The company is developing AYVAKIT for the treatment of non-advanced SM patients, and BLU-263, a next-generation KIT D816V inhibitor, to further address the range of medical needs in this patient population.

About SM

SM is a rare disease driven by the KIT D816V mutation. Uncontrolled proliferation and activation of mast cells result in chronic, severe and often unpredictable symptoms for patients across the spectrum of SM. The vast majority of those affected have non-advanced (indolent or smoldering) SM, with debilitating symptoms that lead to a profound, negative impact on quality of life. A minority of patients have advanced SM, which encompasses a group of high-risk SM subtypes including ASM, SM-AHN and MCL. In addition to mast cell activation symptoms, advanced SM is associated with organ damage due to mast cell infiltration and poor survival.

Debilitating symptoms, including anaphylaxis, maculopapular rash, pruritis, diarrhea, brain fog, fatigue and bone pain, often persist across all forms of SM despite treatment with a number of symptomatic therapies. Patients often live in fear of severe, unexpected symptoms, have limited ability to work or perform daily activities, and isolate themselves to protect against unpredictable triggers. Historically, there had been no approved therapies for the treatment of SM that selectively inhibit D816V mutant KIT.

Important Safety Information

Serious intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) may occur with AYVAKIT treatment; fatal events occurred in <1% of patients. Overall, ICH (eg, subdural hematoma, ICH, and cerebral hemorrhage) occurred in 2.9% of 749 patients who received AYVAKIT. In Advanced SM patients who received AYVAKIT at 200 mg daily, ICH occurred in 2 of 75 patients (2.7%) who had platelet counts =50 x 109/L prior to initiation of therapy and in 3 of 80 patients (3.8%) regardless of platelet counts. Monitor patients closely for risk of ICH including those with thrombocytopenia, vascular aneurysm or a history of ICH or cerebrovascular accident within the prior year. Permanently discontinue AYVAKIT if ICH of any grade occurs. A platelet count must be performed prior to initiating therapy. AYVAKIT is not recommended in Advanced SM patients with platelet counts <50 x 109/L. Following treatment initiation, platelet counts must be performed every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of treatment, monitor platelet counts every 2 weeks or as clinically indicated based on platelet counts. Manage platelet counts of <50 x 109/L by treatment interruption or dose reduction.

Cognitive adverse reactions can occur in patients receiving AYVAKIT. Cognitive adverse reactions occurred in 39% of 749 patients and in 28% of 148 SM patients (3% were Grade >3). Memory impairment occurred in 16% of patients; all events were Grade 1 or 2. Cognitive disorder occurred in 10% of patients; <1% of these events were Grade 3. Confusional state occurred in 6% of patients; <1% of these events were Grade 3. Other events occurred in <2% of patients. Depending on the severity, withhold AYVAKIT and then resume at same dose or at a reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently discontinue.

AYVAKIT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with AYVAKIT and for 6 weeks after the final dose of AYVAKIT. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with AYVAKIT and for 2 weeks after the final dose.

The most common adverse reactions (=20%) at all doses were edema, diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue/asthenia.

Avoid coadministration of AYVAKIT with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce dose of AYVAKIT. Avoid coadministration of AYVAKIT with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers.

To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Blueprint Medicines Corporation at 1-888-258-7768 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

BOSTON, June 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVIR) (“Atea”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of oral therapeutics for severe viral infections, today announced that it has achieved a milestone associated with the development of AT-527 and expects to receive a related payment under its license agreement with Roche of $50 million (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY). Under the license agreement, Roche and Atea are jointly developing AT-527 for the treatment of COVID-19. Atea retains rights to commercialize AT-527 in the United States and Roche has the exclusive right to commercialize AT-527 outside of the United States. AT-527 is an orally administered, direct-acting antiviral developmental agent derived from Atea’s purine nucleotide prodrug platform and is in Phase 3 development for the treatment of COVID-19<em>.</em>

“Working closely with our strategic collaborator Roche, this achievement is reflective of the continual rapid advancement of the AT-527 program,” said Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Atea Pharmaceuticals. “The realization of this milestone brings us one step closer to our goal of providing an easily administered oral, direct-acting antiviral in the fight against this global pandemic.”
<p align=""left"">Direct-acting antivirals, such as AT-527, aim to prevent disease progression by minimizing or eliminating viral replication and thereby reducing the severity of the disease, preventing or shortening hospitalization, and also potentially preventing transmission of the virus to others. Atea believes this makes AT-527 well-suited for potential use in both pre- and post-exposure prophylactic settings and complementary to vaccines.</p>
<strong>About the AT-527 COVID-19 Clinical Development Program</strong>

AT-527 is an orally administered, direct-acting antiviral agent derived from Atea’s nucleotide prodrug platform. AT-527 is currently under evaluation as a treatment for patients with COVID-19. In collaboration with Roche, AT-527 is currently being evaluated in the global Phase 3 MORNINGSKY trial, a global Phase 2 study for hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 and a Phase 2 outpatient study in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19.

<p align=""left"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced topline results from its Phase 2 TANGO study of gosuranemab (BIIB092), an investigational anti-tau antibody that was being evaluated as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
Gosuranemab did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline at week 78 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) compared to placebo in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia. No treatment benefit was seen on exploratory efficacy endpoints, including the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog 13), the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Activity of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ). Gosuranemab was well-tolerated overall, and safety outcomes were consistent with previous studies of the molecule.

Gosuranemab is an antibody directed against the N-terminus of tau. Target engagement was demonstrated with lowering of N-terminal tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), consistent with prior studies. However, in the TANGO Study, no statistically significant treatment effect was observed on tau-PET at week 78 for any of the dose groups.

“While we are disappointed by the results of the Phase 2 study of gosuranemab, we know that the path to innovation is not a straight line, and that we always learn from each trial. We are investing in a broad neuroscience pipeline, including other tau approaches for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Alfred Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., Head of Research and Development at Biogen. “We extend our deepest gratitude to the participants, site staff and the broader Alzheimer’s disease community who contributed to the TANGO study.”

Based on these results, the TANGO study has been terminated. Biogen will discontinue clinical development of gosuranemab. Analyses of additional data, including CSF biomarkers, are ongoing, and Biogen plans to present these TANGO results at an upcoming medical congress.

<strong>About the Phase 2 TANGO Study</strong>
The Phase 2 TANGO (NCT03352557) study of gosuranemab was a 78-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate both safety and efficacy on slowing rates of clinical progression in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or with mild AD, followed by a dose-blind long term extension period. The study enrolled 654 participants across 97 sites. Participants aged 50–80 years with gradual and progressive change in memory function over more than 6 months, who met all of the clinical criteria for MCI due to AD or mild AD, had a CDR-SB of 0.5 for MCI due to AD or 0.5 or 1 for mild AD, a MMSE score of 22 to 30 (inclusive), a CDR Memory Box score of =0.5 and demonstrating amyloid-positivity by CSF or amyloid-PET were randomized to receive IV low, medium or high dose gosuranemab or placebo, once every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was safety.

NORTH BILLERICA, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: LNTH), an established leader and fully integrated provider of innovative imaging diagnostics, targeted therapeutics and artificial intelligence solutions to find, fight and follow serious medical conditions, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved PYLARIFY, an F 18-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent to identify suspected metastasis or recurrence of prostate cancer. PYLARIFY is the first and only commercially available approved PSMA PET imaging agent for prostate cancer. The product will be immediately available in parts of the mid-Atlantic and southern regions and availability is expected to rapidly expand over the next six months with broad availability across the U.S. anticipated by year end.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“The FDA approval of PYLARIFY is a significant milestone for Lantheus and the prostate cancer community in the United States. We believe PYLARIFY represents a paradigm shift in the identification and management of patients with suspected metastasis or recurrent prostate cancer, providing more accurate and earlier detection of disease than conventional imaging so that doctors, along with patients and their families, can make more informed treatment decisions,” said Mary Anne Heino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lantheus. “I would like to thank the patients who participated in our clinical trials, the study investigators and our employees, whose efforts made this achievement possible.”

Identification of suspected metastatic disease in men considering initial definitive therapy is important to optimize treatment planning and to avoid futile interventions. Of men with localized prostate cancer who undergo initial curative intent/management, up to 50% may experience recurrence of their disease within ten years of treatment.<sup>1</sup> Recurrent disease is often detected by a rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels; however, conventional imaging, especially at low PSA levels, is not able to identify the location and extent of the disease in the majority of cases.<sup>2,3</sup>

PYLARIFY was developed to target PSMA, a protein that is overexpressed on the surface of more than 90% of primary and metastatic prostate cancer cells.<sup>4</sup> PYLARIFY binds to the target, enabling the reader of the PET scan to detect and locate the disease. Cyclotron production of F 18 offers high batch capacity and high image resolution, and F 18’s 110-minute half-life allows for wide geographic distribution.<sup>5,6</sup>

“Conventional imaging has significant limitations in detecting prostate cancer, both in initial staging and when the cancer has recurred or spread after initial primary treatment. Specifically, standard imaging poorly detects the early spread to distant organs, such as the lymph nodes, bones, and other organs,” said Michael J. Morris, M.D., Prostate Cancer Section Head, Genitourinary Medical Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Lead Study Investigator in the CONDOR trial and Study Investigator in the OSPREY trial. “PYLARIFY can detect the spread of disease well before standard imaging and can be a transformative diagnostic tool that helps clinicians develop treatment plans based on a much more accurate understanding of a patient’s distribution of disease.”

“We believe today’s approval is a game-changer for men facing prostate cancer,"" said Jamie Bearse, Chief Executive Officer of ZERO - The End of Prostate Cancer, a Patient Advocacy Group. ""Having a diagnostic tool that allows doctors to see suspected metastatic or recurrent prostate cancer earlier, anywhere in the body, is a significant step forward and will have a tremendous impact on patients' lives.”

The approval of PYLARIFY is based on data from two Company-sponsored pivotal studies (OSPREY and CONDOR) designed to establish the safety and diagnostic performance of PYLARIFY across the prostate cancer disease continuum. Results from OSPREY (Cohort A) demonstrated improvement in specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of PYLARIFY PET imaging over conventional imaging in men at risk for metastatic prostate cancer prior to initial therapy. CONDOR studied men with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer. In patients with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer and non-informative baseline imaging, PYLARIFY demonstrated high correct localization and detection rates, including in patients with low PSA values (median PSA 0.8 ng/mL).

In the clinical trials, PYLARIFY was well tolerated. In OSPREY and CONDOR, 593 patients with various states of prostate cancer were exposed to a single dose of PYLARIFY. Adverse reactions (headache, dysgeusia and fatigue) were reported in = 2% of patients within the studies. In addition, a delayed hypersensitivity reaction was reported in one patient (0.2%) with a history of allergic reaction.

<b>About PYLARIFY<sup>®</sup></b>

PYLARIFY<sup>®</sup> (piflufolastat F 18) injection (also known as <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL or PyL) is a fluorinated small molecule PSMA-targeted PET imaging agent that enables visualization of lymph nodes, bone and soft tissue metastases to determine the presence or absence of recurrent and/or metastatic prostate cancer. For men with prostate cancer, PYLARIFY PET combines the accuracy of PET imaging<sup>2</sup>, the precision of PSMA targeting and the clarity of an F 18 radioisotope<sup>5</sup> for superior diagnostic performance. The recommended PYLARIFY dose is 333 MBq (9 mCi) with an acceptable range of 296 MBq to 370 MBq (8 mCi to 10 mCi), administered as a bolus intravenous injection.<sup>1,5,7,8,9</sup>

<b>About Prostate Cancer</b>

Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer affecting men in the United States -- an estimated one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimes. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2021, almost 250,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed, and more than 30,000 men will die of the disease. Approximately 3.1 million men in the United States currently count themselves as prostate cancer survivors.<sup>10</sup>

<b>PYLARIFY<sup>®</sup> (piflufolastat F 18) Injection</b>

<b>Indication</b>

PYLARIFY<sup>®</sup> (piflufolastat F 18) Injection is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy.</li>
 	<li>with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.</li>
</ul>
<b>Important Safety Information</b>

<b>Contraindications</b>

None.

<b>Warnings and Precautions</b>

<b>Risk of Image Misinterpretation</b>

Imaging interpretation errors can occur with PYLARIFY imaging. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of patients with biochemical evidence of recurrence of prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by risk factors such as Gleason score and tumor stage. PYLARIFY uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes and in normal tissues. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended.

<b>Hypersensitivity Reactions</b>

Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions, particularly patients with a history of allergy to other drugs and foods. Reactions may be delayed. Always have trained staff and resuscitation equipment available.

<b>Radiation Risks</b>

Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including PYLARIFY, expose patients to radiation. Radiation exposure is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.

<b>Adverse Reactions</b>

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headaches, dysgeusia and fatigue, occurring at rate of =2% during clinical studies with PYLARIFY. In addition, a delayed hypersensitivity reaction was reported in one patient (0.2%) with a history of allergic reactions.

<b>Drug interactions</b>

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway, such as androgen receptor antagonists, may result in changes in uptake of PYLARIFY in prostate cancer. The effect of these therapies on performance of PYLARIFY PET has not been established.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 17, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ombO6vV_17Ws4YSNXPvnFrC-17vqLhgNM_LO2AHwD7LGnHvLxmARCNwl3y3VFKuddv4Yq2pf3D7JqteLpQvxDw=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Biogen Inc.</a> (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the global clinical study, TOPAZ-1. The Phase 3 study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and assess the safety of BIIB059, a first in-class, humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2), as compared to placebo, in participants with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). TOPAZ-1 is expected to be conducted at approximately 135 sites worldwide and aims to enroll 540 adults with active SLE.

“A chronic autoimmune condition such as lupus, which overwhelmingly affects women, has a tremendous impact on my patients’ daily lives, including their physical, mental and social wellbeing,” said Richard Furie, M.D., Chief of the Division of Rheumatology at Northwell Health and Professor at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. “There remains a significant need for efficacious and generally safe treatment options for lupus patients. Based on the positive results observed in the Phase 2 LILAC study, we are excited to continue to evaluate the potential of BIIB059 in TOPAZ-1.”

TOPAZ-1 is a 52-week, multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BIIB059 compared with placebo. Participants will be randomized to receive subcutaneous treatment with BIIB059 at one of two doses or placebo every four weeks with an additional dose at Week 2, in addition to their existing lupus therapy.

“We look forward to working with the lupus community as we advance the clinical development of BIIB059 with the hope of bringing a meaningful new treatment option to people living with systemic and cutaneous lupus,” said Nathalie Franchimont, M.D., Ph.D., Head of the Multiple Sclerosis and Immunology Development Unit at Biogen. “Additionally, we are reinforcing Biogen’s commitment to the inclusion of underrepresented groups in our clinical trials. We have set enrollment targets that reflect the prevalence of SLE in African-American and Hispanic/Latinx communities with the aim to achieve appropriate representation in the TOPAZ-1 study.”

The primary objective of TOPAZ-1 is to demonstrate reduction in disease activity as measured with the primary endpoint, proportion of participants who achieve an SLE Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) response at Week 52. SRI is a composite index using validated indices to measure global and organ-/system-specific disease activity. Key secondary endpoints will evaluate the effect of BIIB059 on additional efficacy parameters including proportion of patients achieving SRI-4 response at Week 24, oral corticosteroid use, organ-specific disease activity (joint and/or skin) and flare rates. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study duration.

The initiation of the TOPAZ-1 study is based on the results from the Phase 2 LILAC study. In LILAC, BIIB059 met its primary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant reduction of disease activity in patients with SLE. The majority of adverse events in the LILAC study were mild or moderate.

More information on the TOPAZ-1 study (NCT04895241) is available at <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1bBmYOdUhxkOMPC3dZeV69ch0KWj9kEEYMd8MclELlWUDP9FOUWypR2aLst7xFiAk2hi6kEl1PHIQ8F4apu0HoMSTaNmDb58qsQYyMmNd14="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">clinicaltrials.gov</a>.

<strong>About BIIB059</strong>
BIIB059, discovered and developed exclusively by Biogen, is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2) and is being investigated for the potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). BDCA2 is a receptor that is exclusively expressed on a subset of human immune cells called Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs), and it has been shown to reduce inflammatory cytokine production from pDCs, including type-I IFN (IFN-I). Inflammatory mediators are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of lupus.

<strong>About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</strong>
SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems, with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of remission. SLE can present itself in several ways including rash, arthritis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, serositis, nephritis, seizures or psychosis. SLE is associated with a greater risk of death from causes such as infection and cardiovascular disease. There are an estimated four million people worldwide impacted by SLE.<sup>i</sup>

Although anyone can develop lupus, an estimated ninety percent of people living with lupus are women; most begin to see symptoms between the ages of 15-40.<sup>ii</sup> The disease disproportionately impacts certain ethno-racial groups, including African American, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native and Hispanic/Latinx communities.<sup>iii</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>iv</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>v</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>vi</sup> There is currently no cure for lupus.

Biogen is advancing two investigational lupus assets in Phase 3 studies: BIIB059, an anti-BDCA2, and dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40L being developed in collaboration with UCB, which began a Phase 3 trial in 2020.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160), a global biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative medicines worldwide, today announced that the first patient was dosed in the global Phase 3 AdvanTIG-302 trial of BeiGene’s investigational anti-TIGIT antibody ociperlimab (BGB-A1217) in combination with its anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab, for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors exhibit high PD-L1 expression and do not harbor EGFR-sensitizing mutations or ALK translocations. This marks the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial in the planned global pivotal program for ociperlimab.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“Ociperlimab is a potent anti-TIGIT antibody with intact Fc function, which we believe to be critical for the anti-tumor activities of TIGIT antibodies. Ociperlimab is our fourth internally discovered molecule entering the pivotal stage of clinical development, and now one of the most advanced anti-TIGIT antibodies in development globally. We intend to explore the potential use of ociperlimab in additional settings and indications in our late-stage development program,” commented Yong (Ben) Ben, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Immuno-Oncology, at BeiGene. “We hope that the AdvanTIG-302 trial will support a new and improved chemotherapy-free regimen for a significant portion of first-line patients with NSCLC and potentially other cancer patients with unmet needs.”

<b>AdvanTIG-302 Trial of Ociperlimab in Combination with Tislelizumab in NSCLC</b>

AdvanTIG-302 is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, global Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04746924), expected to enroll approximately 605 treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors exhibit high PD-L1 expression and do not harbor EGFR-sensitizing mutations or ALK translocations in the United States, Australia and other countries and regions across the globe. Patients will be randomized to receive ociperlimab and tislelizumab combination treatment, pembrolizumab, or tislelizumab alone. The primary endpoints of the trial are progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population; secondary endpoints include safety and other efficacy endpoints.

For more information about the trial, patients and physicians should email BeiGene at <a href=""mailto:clinicaltrials@beigene.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">clinicaltrials@beigene.com</a>.

<b>About Ociperlimab (BGB-A1217)</b>

Ociperlimab (BGB-A1217) is an investigational humanized IgG 1 monoclonal antibody discovered and being developed globally by BeiGene. An immune checkpoint molecule, BGB-A1217 is one of the most advanced anti-TIGIT antibodies in development with intact Fc function.

Targeting TIGIT provides a potential mechanism to rescue immune cells (e.g., T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells) from the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, to induce an efficient antitumor immune response. The TIGIT pathway has been understood to cooperate with PD-1 to maximize the suppression of effector tumor infiltrating immune cells as well as to promote resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. TIGIT represents a promising target with the potential to significantly improve and/or extend the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 therapy to a greater number of patients.

Ociperlimab is currently being investigated in combination with tislelizumab in multiple ongoing trials, including:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>AdvanTIG-302: Phase 3 trial in untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NCT04746924);</li>
 	<li>AdvanTIG-202: Phase 2 trial in metastatic cervical cancer (NCT04693234);</li>
 	<li>AdvanTIG-203: Phase 2 trial in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (NCT04732494); and</li>
 	<li>Phase 1b trial in advanced solid tumors (NCT04047862).</li>
</ul>
<b>About Tislelizumab</b>

Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc?R on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to Fc?R on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Tislelizumab is the first drug from BeiGene’s immuno-oncology biologics program and is being developed internationally as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers.

The China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has granted tislelizumab approval in three indications, including full approval for first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy; and conditional approval for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL) who received at least two prior therapies and for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with PD-L1 high expression whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Full approval for these indications is contingent upon results from ongoing randomized, controlled confirmatory clinical trials.

In addition, four supplemental Biologics License Applications for tislelizumab have been accepted by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the NMPA and are under review for first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy, for second- or third-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy, for patients with previously treated unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, and for the treatment of patients with previously treated, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) solid tumors.

BeiGene has initiated or completed 17 potentially registration-enabling clinical trials in China and globally, including 13 Phase 3 trials and four pivotal Phase 2 trials.

In January 2021, BeiGene and Novartis entered into a collaboration and license agreement granting Novartis rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize tislelizumab in North America, Europe, and Japan.

Tislelizumab is not approved for use outside of China.

<span class=""xn-location"">TEL AVIV, Israel</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 17, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <u>CytoReason</u>, an AI company developing a computational disease model of the human body for clinical drug development, today announced the initiation of a project with French global biopharmaceutical company Sanofi, which will utilize its cell-centered models and deconvolution techniques to suggest mechanistic insights for each asthma endotype.

The focus of this project is to gain clarity on the heterogeneity of asthma patients, with the goal of identifying stable and reproducible asthma endotypes, as well as associated diagnostic features, using minimal invasive procedures. For this project, CytoReason's AI platform will use one of the most comprehensive datasets in moderate to severe asthma, covering samples from both adults and children.

Asthma is a complex disease with genetic and environmental factors that lead to airway inflammation, resulting in excess mucus in a patient's airway, which causes coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. It can appear in several degrees of severity, ranging from mild to severe, and can be classified as either Type 2 asthma, which includes allergic and eosinophilic asthma, or non-Type 2 asthma, which is associated with low eosinophil counts often presented with altered innate immune response and activation of Th17 cells. Though symptoms of the disease can often be controlled, asthma, which is a key area of research for Sanofi, cannot be completely cured. One of the main challenges in the disease is classification of patients to find the most suitable treatment.

""We are very excited to be launching our collaboration with Sanofi,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">David Harel</span>, CEO and Co-founder of CytoReason. ""It represents a chance to make a real difference in driving better understanding of the heterogeneous and complex nature of asthma and its diversified manifestation in patients. Additionally, the work we do with Sanofi could enhance future research in this field and could inform precision medicine strategies for improved patient benefit.""

<p align=""justify"">The BNT111-01 trial which is being conducted in collaboration with Regeneron, was reviewed and approved by the regulatory authorities in Spain, Germany, Italy and Poland as well as in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. The open-label randomized trial evaluates the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of BNT111 in combination with Libtayo, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, being co-developed by Regeneron and Sanofi. The trial is enrolling a total of 120 patients and will evaluate the effects of the combination as well as single agents alone. The primary endpoint is the overall response rate of BNT111 in combination with Libtayo. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate in the single agent arms, duration of response, and safety. The first patient has been dosed in the EU. BioNTech retains global commercial rights to BNT111.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Our vision is to harness the power of the immune system against cancer and infectious diseases. We were able to demonstrate the potential of mRNA vaccines in addressing COVID-19. We must not forget, that cancer is also a global health threat, even worse than the current pandemic,“ said <strong>Özlem Türeci, M.D., Co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of BioNTech</strong>. “BNT111 has already shown a favorable safety profile and encouraging preliminary results in early clinical evaluation. With the start of patient treatment in our Phase 2 trial, we are encouraged to continue on our initial path to realize the potential of mRNA vaccines for cancer patients.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">BNT111 is an intravenous therapeutic cancer vaccine candidate encoding for a fixed set of four cancer-specific antigens optimized for immunogenicity and delivered as RNA-lipoplex formulation. More than 90% of melanomas in patients express at least one of the four tumor-associated antigens encoded in BNT111 (NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, tyrosinase, and TPTE). BNT111 is one of the most advanced of five clinical-stage FixVac product candidates within BioNTech’s development pipeline.</p>
<p align=""justify"">This Phase 2 clinical trial is based on previous results from the Phase 1 Lipo-MERIT dose escalation trial (<a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CaNMiNwyPuZO3iFW2DQFfu3_euP5Yx0fqxlyGhv9T6BFEyOAZMYEpdrulWw1klg9LLIa9pzs1tAJQ9EfVGLmBi-RIY5FGX-R0kGTDaPEHYzyiQUn3n-d4p7U0M1m6VpM"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>NCT02410733</u></a>) that demonstrated a favorable safety profile in 89 patients with advanced melanoma. In addition, efficacy analysis of the Lipo-MERIT study in a subset of 42 metastatic melanoma patients previously treated with a checkpoint-inhibitor (CPI) showed that BNT111 mediated durable responses both as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies and that durable objective responses by BNT111 were associated with activation and strong expansion of tumor-antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These results were published in <a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=iDcR54uYHAIaS2eiVT5F-LTPmly7QV0gechCzrc9ur6TWFXaO3pKQwClbHLQIV17YSFtOYj4OUQlQ3-O5hYzl_BepGC-KrFI47U2UWwqVOQ="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><em><u>Nature</u></em></a> in July 2020.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The Company also plans to start randomized Phase 2 trials with mRNA vaccine product candidates in two additional programs in 2021 (FixVac: BNT113 and iNeST: BNT122). As part of its development strategy, BioNTech aims to rapidly advance its broad oncology pipeline and expects to bring additional candidates into late-stage clinical development and towards market entry within the next five years.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About FixVac</strong>

“Lineage is a clinical-stage cell therapy company supported by a vast intellectual property portfolio. From this portfolio, we continue to find opportunities to unlock value from non-core assets through option and license agreements for assets such as HyStem,” stated Brian Culley, Lineage CEO. “Many tissue engineering and regenerative cell-based therapies will require the delivery of therapeutic cells in a matrix or scaffold for accurate anatomical placement, cell retention, and engraftment. This option agreement represents an opportunity to provide Amasa with access to our clinical-grade HyStem material for future development of oncology-related products delivered via HyStem and, alongside a previously announced deal with Advanced BioMatrix, is the second HyStem-related transaction we have entered into.”

HyStem is a patented biomaterial that is made from and structurally mimics naturally occurring extracellular matrix, the structural network of molecules surrounding cells in organs and tissues that is essential to cellular function and tissue structure. The technology underlying the HyStem hydrogels is based on a unique thiol cross-linking strategy. Building upon this technology, the HyStem family of hydrogels are novel biomaterials that offer unique strategies for cell therapy and bioactive molecule delivery. A distinctive feature of the HyStem hydrogel is that it allows the mixture of cells with the matrix in a liquid form such that the cells and matrix can be injected easily through a small gauge syringe, and then the matrix can polymerize around the cells to create a three-dimensional tissue within the body. When implanted in HyStem hydrogels, cells remain attached and localized within the hydrogel and slowly degrade the implanted matrix and replace it with their natural extracellular matrices. Current research at leading medical institutions has shown that HyStem is compatible with a wide variety of cells and tissue types including brain, bone, skin, cartilage, vascular and heart tissues.

“We believe use of Lineage’s clinical-grade HyStem hydrogels will allow us to quickly move candidates into the clinic with our novel approach of using receptor-targeted cell therapies to address intractable solid tumors such as glioblastoma,” stated Arthur Hiller, Amasa CEO. “The physiochemical properties of the HyStem hydrogel and its ability to provide a suitable extracellular matrix give our cell therapies the best opportunity to remain viable, be retained in the targeted tumor resection cavity, and eradicate residual tumor cells,” stated Khalid Shah, founder of Amasa.

<b>About HyStem<sup>®</sup></b>

Lineage has developed a family of hyaluronan based hydrogels (HyStem) that mimics the natural extracellular matrix and has potential applications in 3-D cell culture, stem cell propagation and differentiation, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, cell-based therapies, and as delivery vehicles for bioactive molecules. HyStem hydrogels were designed to recapitulate the minimal composition necessary to obtain a functional extracellular matrix (ECM). The individual components of the hydrogels are cross-linkable over time, and thus may be seeded with cells prior to in vivo injection, without compromising either the cells or the recipient tissues. HyStem hydrogels have been shown to support attachment and proliferation of a wide variety of cell types in both 2-D and 3-D cultures and provide timed release of proteins and other bioactive moieties. HyStem hydrogels exhibit a high degree of biocompatibility when implanted in vivo and are readily degraded in vitro and biodegrade in vivo through hydrolysis via naturally occurring enzymes. When implanted in HyStem hydrogels, cells remain attached and localized within the hydrogel and slowly degrade the implanted matrix and replace it with their natural ECMs. When used as a delivery vehicle, bioactive molecules are released by both diffusion as well as degradation of the hydrogel. The patented technology underlying Lineage’s HyStem hydrogel products in development, such as Renevia<sup>®</sup>, has been exclusively licensed to Lineage for human therapeutic uses. Since the first published report in 2002, there have been over 300 academic scientific publications supporting the biocompatibility of thiol cross-linked hyaluronan-based hydrogels and their applications as medical devices and in cell culture, tissue engineering, and animal models of cell-based therapies. Due to the unique cross-linking chemistry, HyStem hydrogels have the ability to be formulated with cells and can be injected or applied as a liquid and form a gel in situ, which allows the hydrogel to conform to a cavity or space. This property of HyStem hydrogels is expected to offer several distinct advantages over other hydrogels, including the possibility of combining bioactive materials with the hydrogel at the point of use.

<p align=""justify""><strong>PARIS</strong><strong> – </strong><strong>June</strong> <strong>18</strong><strong>, 20</strong><strong>21 </strong>- The European Commission (EC) has approved Aubagio<sup>®</sup> (teriflunomide) for the treatment of pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The EC approval is based on data from the Phase 3 TERIKIDS study. The approval confirms Aubagio as the first oral multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy for first-line treatment of children and adolescents with MS in the European Union.</p>
<p align=""justify"">MS affects an estimated 2.8 million people around the world, with children and adolescents representing at least 30,000 of those impacted.<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>2</sup> Pediatric MS is a rare condition and onset follows a relapsing-remitting disease course in 98 percent of pediatric patients.<sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>4</sup> Compared with adult-onset MS, pediatric patients often present with higher relapse rates and a greater lesion burden.<sup>5</sup> Due to the earlier onset of disease, irreversible disability and secondary progression often occur at an earlier age than with adult counterparts.<sup>3</sup> The symptoms of MS can impact all aspects of a young person’s life from physical health to social development and self-esteem.<sup>6</sup>

<em>“</em><em>Pediatric multiple sclerosis remains an area of significant unmet medical need,” said Erik </em><em>Wallström</em><em>, MD, PhD, Therapeutic Area Head, Neurology Development at Sanofi Genzyme. “The European approval of Aubagio in pediatrics means young people with MS have a new treatment option, and importantly - one that can offer meaningful improvement in managing this serious disease.”</em>

Aubagio was initially approved in the EU in 2013 for the treatment of adult patients with RRMS and the EC approval for the pediatric indication provides an additional year of marketing protection in the European Union.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Aubagio Efficacy and Safety in Pediatric Patients</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The Phase 3 TERIKIDS study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that enrolled 166 pediatric patients with relapsing-remitting forms of MS across 22 countries worldwide. The study consisted of a screening period (up to four weeks), followed by a double-blind treatment period (up to 96 weeks after randomization). An open-label TERIKIDS Phase 3 trial extension is ongoing. The primary endpoint was time to first confirmed clinical relapse, with prespecified sensitivity analysis including time to high magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity as relapse equivalent. Additionally, patients who completed the double-blind period, or had high MRI activity, were eligible to continue into the open-label extension.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The primary efficacy results and safety and tolerability data from the double-blind core study period (up to 96 weeks after randomization) were initially presented at the 2020 EAN Virtual Congress.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In the study, 109 and 57 patients were randomized to teriflunomide and placebo, respectively.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The primary endpoint was not statistically significant with numerically a lower risk (-34%) of clinical relapse for teriflunomide vs placebo (median time: 75.3 vs 39.1 weeks; HR [95% CI] 0.66 [0.39, 1.1] P=0.29). Switches from double-blind to open-label treatment due to high MRI activity were more frequent than anticipated. Switches were more frequent and earlier in the placebo group vs teriflunomide (26% and 14%, respectively). This decreased study power for the primary endpoint.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In the pre-specified sensitivity analysis of the composite endpoint of time to first clinical relapse or high MRI activity meeting study criteria to switch to open label, teriflunomide significantly reduced the time to clinical relapse or switch due to high MRI activity by 43% relative to placebo (median time: 72.1 vs 37.0 weeks; HR [95% CI] 0.57 [0.37, 0.87] P=0.04).</p>
<p align=""justify"">Key secondary endpoints showed teriflunomide significantly reduced the number of T1 gadolinium (Gd) -enhancing lesions per MRI scan (relative reduction 75%; P&lt;0.0001) as well as the number of new and enlarging T2 lesions per MRI scan (relative reduction 55%, P=0.0006).</p>
<p align=""justify"">In the study, teriflunomide was well tolerated and had a manageable safety profile in the pediatric population. The overall incidences of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were similar in the teriflunomide group and the placebo group (88.1% vs 82.5%, and 11.0% vs 10.5%), respectively. There were no deaths in the study. AEs reported more frequently in the teriflunomide group than the placebo group (with a difference of = 5%) included nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, alopecia, paresthesia, abdominal pain, and increased blood creatine phosphokinase (= 3 times the upper limit of normal). Cases of pancreatitis were reported in 1.8% (2/109) of the teriflunomide-treated patients compared to none in the placebo group, in the double-blind phase. In pediatric patients treated with teriflunomide in the open-label phase of the study, two additional cases of pancreatitis and one case of serious acute pancreatitis (with pseudo-papilloma), were reported.</p>

<span class=""bw-dateline-wrapper"">PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span>Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted full Marketing Authorization for <i>Onureg</i><sup>®</sup> (azacitidine tablets) as a maintenance therapy in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment and who are not candidates for, including those who choose not to proceed to, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). <i>Onureg </i>is<i></i>the first and only once-daily, frontline oral maintenance therapy to demonstrate significant overall survival and show a relapse-free survival benefit in patients with a broad range of AML subtypes.

The centralized Marketing Authorization approves use of <i>Onureg </i>in all EU member states, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.* <i>Onureg</i> is approved in the United States for the continued treatment of adult patients with AML who achieved first CR or CRi following intensive induction chemotherapy and who are not able to complete intensive curative therapy.<sup>1</sup> In Canada, <i>Onureg</i> is approved as a maintenance therapy for adult patients with AML who achieved CR or CRi following induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment, and who are not eligible for HSCT.<sup>2</sup>

“An unmet need exists for maintenance therapy options for acute myeloid leukemia in the European Union, given responses to induction therapy may be of short duration and the risk of relapse is high, especially for patients not eligible for stem cell transplant,” said Andrew Wei, MBBS, Ph.D., QUAZAR<sup>®</sup> AML-001 lead investigator, Alfred Hospital and Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. “The approval of <i>Onureg</i> by the European Commission has the potential to clinically benefit and change the treatment paradigm of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, across a range of subtypes.”

The EC approval of <i>Onureg</i> was based on results from the QUAZAR<sup>®</sup> AML-001 study, a Phase 3, international, randomized, double-blind trial. Eligible patients were ages 55 years or older, had newly diagnosed AML, intermediate or poor cytogenetics, had achieved first CR or CRi following intensive induction chemotherapy with or without consolidation treatment (per investigator preference prior to study entry), and were not candidates for HSCT at the time of screening.<sup>3</sup>

“Today’s approval of<i> Onureg</i> represents a significant advance for patients in the European Union living with acute myeloid leukemia, who have remained in urgent need of maintenance therapies for this aggressive blood cancer,” said Noah Berkowitz, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, Hematology Development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We are committed to helping to improve long-term outcomes and greatly extending survival for patients with hard-to-treat diseases, as we work collaboratively with European Union member states to make <i>Onureg</i> available to eligible patients as quickly as possible.”

<i>*Centralized Marketing Authorization does not include approval in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales).</i>

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About QUAZAR<sup>®</sup> AML-001</span></b>

QUAZAR<sup>®</sup> AML-001, is a Phase 3, international, randomized, double-blind study. Eligible patients were ages 55 years or older, had newly diagnosed AML, intermediate or poor cytogenetics, had achieved first CR or CRi following intensive induction chemotherapy with or without consolidation treatment (per investigator preference prior to study entry) within four months (+/- 7 days) before randomization, and were not candidates for HSCT at the time of screening. The study enrolled 472 patients, randomized 1:1 to receive either <i>Onureg</i> 300 mg (N=238) or placebo (N=234) orally, once daily, for 14 days of a 28-day cycle, plus best supportive care and results were published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> in December 2020.*<sup>3,4</sup>

Median OS, the primary endpoint, from time of randomization was greater than two years (24.7 months; 95% CI: 18.7 to 30.5) in the <i>Onureg</i> arm compared to 14.8 months for placebo (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.86; p=0.0009). The median duration of treatment was 12 cycles (1 to 82) for <i>Onureg</i> and 6 cycles with placebo (1 to 76).Median relapse-free survival was also significantly longer with <i>Onureg </i>than with placebo (10.2 months and 4.8 months, respectively; p&lt;0.001). Overall health-related quality of life was preserved during <i>Onureg</i> treatment.<sup>4</sup>

The most common adverse events in both treatment arms were Grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal events. Common Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (41% of patients treated with <i>Onureg </i>and 24% of patients with placebo) and thrombocytopenia (22% and 21%, respectively).<sup>4</sup>

<i>*Individual results associated with regulatory authorities may differ from publication.</i>

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About AML</span></b>

AML is one of the most common acute leukemias in adults.<sup>5</sup> The worldwide incidence of AML has been estimated at more than 350,000 cases, and the estimated 5-year survival rate for AML in Europe is 17%.<sup>6 </sup>AML is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells in the bone marrow and as such interferes with normal blood cell production and function. Because of the impaired production of red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells, it can present with signs of anemia, bleeding and infections.<sup>5</sup> AML is a heterogeneous disease associated with diverse genetic mutations, and can rapidly progress and lead to death if not promptly treated.<sup>7 </sup>AML response to treatment may be of short duration, meaning following patients' initial response to chemotherapy, about 50% of patients relapse within one year, thus representing a significant unmet need for maintenance treatment options that prolong overall survival.<sup>8</sup>

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Onureg</i></span> </b><sup>®</sup>

Onureg, the first and only frontline maintenance therapy approved in the European Union for patients with a broad range of AML subtypes, is a once-daily oral hypomethylating agent that incorporates into DNA and RNA. The main mechanism of action is thought to be hypomethylation of DNA, as well as direct cytotoxicity to abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for cell differentiation and proliferation.<sup>9,10 </sup><i>Onureg </i>is approved in the U.S. for continued treatment of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia who achieved first complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following intensive induction chemotherapy and are not able to complete intensive curative therapy. <i>Onureg</i> is also approved in Canada as maintenance therapy for adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment, and who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

<b><span class=""bwuline"">U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>CONTRAINDICATIONS</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>ONUREG is contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to azacitidine or its components.</li>
</ul>
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b><span class=""bwuline"">Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products:</span> </b>Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters, the recommended dose and schedule for ONUREG are different from those for the intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine at the recommended dosage of ONUREG may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment with ONUREG at the doses recommended for intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine may not be effective. Do not substitute ONUREG for intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine.</li>
 	<li><b><span class=""bwuline"">Myelosuppression:</span> </b>New or worsening Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 49% and 22% of patients who received ONUREG. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 12%. A dose reduction was required for 7% and 2% of patients due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Less than 1% of patients discontinued ONUREG due to either neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Monitor complete blood counts and modify the dosage as recommended. Provide standard supportive care, including hematopoietic growth factors, if myelosuppression occurs.</li>
 	<li><b><span class=""bwuline"">Increased Early Mortality in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS):</span> </b>In AZA-MDS-003, 216 patients with red blood cell transfusion-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia due to MDS were randomized to ONUREG or placebo. 107 received a median of 5 cycles of ONUREG 300 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Enrollment was discontinued early due to a higher incidence of early fatal and/or serious adverse reactions in the ONUREG arm compared with placebo. The most frequent fatal adverse reaction was sepsis. Safety and effectiveness of ONUREG for MDS have not been established. Treatment of MDS with ONUREG is not recommended outside of controlled trials.</li>
 	<li><b><span class=""bwuline"">Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:</span> </b>ONUREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine caused fetal death and anomalies in pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal dose less than the recommended human daily dose of oral azacitidine on a mg/m2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ONUREG and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ONUREG and for at least 3 months after the last dose.</li>
</ul>
<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Serious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients who received ONUREG. Serious adverse reactions in =2% included pneumonia (8%) and febrile neutropenia (7%). One fatal adverse reaction (sepsis) occurred in a patient who received ONUREG.</li>
 	<li>Most common (=10%) adverse reactions with ONUREG vs placebo were nausea (65%, 24%), vomiting (60%, 10%), diarrhea (50%, 21%), fatigue/asthenia (44%, 25%), constipation (39%, 24%), pneumonia (27%, 17%), abdominal pain (22%, 13%), arthralgia (14%, 10%), decreased appetite (13%, 6%), febrile neutropenia (12%, 8%), dizziness (11%, 9%), pain in extremity (11%, 5%).</li>
</ul>
<b>LACTATION</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>There are no data regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk or the effects on the breastfed child or milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ONUREG and for 1 week after the last dose.</li>

<strong>Basel, June 18, 2021</strong> <strong>– </strong>Novartis today announced data that reinforce the transformational benefit of Zolgensma<sup>®</sup> (onasemnogene abeparvovec), an essential, one-time treatment and the only gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). New late-breaker data from the completed two-copy cohort of the Phase 3 SPR1NT clinical trial demonstrate age-appropriate milestone development in presymptomatic children with SMA without respiratory or nutritional support of any kind, and with no serious, treatment-related adverse events. The completed Phase 3 STR1VE-EU trial demonstrated rapid improvements in motor function following treatment with Zolgensma, and the majority of patients achieved motor milestones not observed in the natural history of SMA Type 1. Safety remained consistent with previously reported data. The data will be presented at the European Academy for Neurology (EAN) Virtual Congress 2021.

The Zolgensma data represent a significant contrast to the natural history of SMA Type 1, which leads to progressive and irreversible loss of motor function and if left untreated, often death or permanent ventilation by the age of two years.<sup>2,3</sup> Remarkably, all children (100 percent) treated presymptomatically in the SPR1NT two-copy cohort achieved event-free survival, were independent of respiratory and nutritional support and met the primary endpoint of sitting independently for =30 seconds, including 11/14 (79 percent) who achieved this milestone within the World Health Organization (WHO) window of normal development.<sup>4</sup> A majority of patients went on to stand independently (11/14) and walk independently (9/14), most within the typical range of normal development.<sup>4</sup>

Among symptomatic children with SMA Type 1 treated in the STR1VE-EU trial, including patients with more severe disease at baseline, the majority of children (82 percent) achieved developmental motor milestones not observed in the natural history of SMA Type 1, including 16 children (49 percent) who sat without support for =30 seconds.<sup>5</sup>

“With more than 1,200 children now treated, these data presented at EAN further reinforce the life-changing benefit of a one-time treatment of Zolgensma,” said Shephard Mpofu, M.D., SVP, Chief Medical Officer, Novartis Gene Therapies. “When treated with Zolgensma prior to the onset of symptoms, not only did all patients survive, but were thriving — breathing and eating on their own and sitting independently, with many standing and walking. When you consider these newborns would go on to develop severe symptoms of SMA Type 1, a devastating, progressive disease that robs children of the ability to talk, eat, sit up and even breathe, findings from the SPR1NT trial are nothing short of extraordinary.”

“STR1VE-EU included some patients with more severe SMA at baseline, yet the study demonstrated consistent and significant therapeutic benefit for symptomatic children with SMA Type 1,” said Professor Eugenio Mercuri, M.D., PhD., Department of Pediatric Neurology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. “This is a remarkable outcome that adds to the robust body of clinical evidence for Zolgensma showing that even among patients with more severe disease, Zolgensma was highly effective and demonstrated a consistent safety profile.”

<strong>Final Phase 3 SPR1NT Two-Copy Cohort Results</strong>
SPR1NT is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a one-time intravenous (IV) infusion of Zolgensma in presymptomatic patients with a genetic diagnosis of SMA and two or three copies of <em>SMN2</em> who were =6 weeks of age. Fourteen patients with two copies of <em>SMN2</em> and 15 patients with three copies of <em>SMN2</em> were treated. The majority of patients with two copies of <em>SMN2</em> develop SMA Type 1, the most common form accounting for 60 percent of cases. Data reported at EAN reflect the final data cut for SPR1NT two-copy patients. Mean age at dosing in the two-copy cohort was 20.6 days (8 – 34 days). The study of the three-copy cohort is ongoing.

Two-copy cohort (n=14) final results:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>One hundred percent of patients (14/14) met the secondary endpoint of survival without ventilatory support of any kind at 14 months of age,<sup>4</sup> versus only 26 percent of patients in the Pediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research (PNCR) natural history cohort.<sup>6</sup></li>
 	<li>All patients (100 percent) achieved the primary endpoint of sitting independently for at least 30 seconds, including 11 (79 percent) who achieved this milestone within the WHO window of normal development.<sup>4</sup></li>
 	<li>Eleven patients (79 percent) could stand independently, seven of whom achieved this milestone within the WHO window of normal development.<sup>4</sup></li>
 	<li>Nine patients (64 percent) could walk independently, five of whom achieved this milestone within the WHO window of normal development.<sup>4</sup></li>
 	<li>All patients (100 percent) were independent of nutritional and respiratory support for the duration of the study.<sup>4</sup>
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li>Nearly all patients (13/14) achieved the additional secondary efficacy endpoint of age-appropriate weight maintenance without non-oral feeding support at any visit up to 18 months of age.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>All patients (100 percent) achieved or maintained a Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) score of =58.<sup>4</sup> According to natural history, untreated patients with SMA Type 1 almost never achieve a CHOP INTEND score of =40.<sup>6</sup></li>
 	<li>All patients (100 percent) had Bayley-III fine motor performance scores similar to same-age peers without SMA and the majority (64 percent) had gross motor performance scores similar to same-age peers without SMA.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>
All patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) after dosing, 10 (71 percent) of which were considered to be treatment-related.<sup>4</sup> There were no serious, treatment-related AEs. Five patients were reported to have had serious adverse events (SAEs), all of which resolved and were not related to treatment.<sup>4</sup>

<strong>Final Phase 3 STR1VE-EU Results</strong>
STR1VE-EU was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single, one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in patients with SMA Type 1 who had bi-allelic <em>SMN1</em> gene deletion or point mutations and one or two copies of the <em>SMN2</em> backup gene, and were less than six months of age. Mean age at dosing was 4.1 months, and mean age at symptom onset was 1.6 months. The mean CHOP INTEND score at baseline was 28. All patients had two <em>SMN2 </em>copies and were symptomatic with a variable degree of severity. Patients with SMA Type 1 not treated with disease-modifying therapy will never sit unassisted. If left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or permanent ventilation by the age of two in the majority of cases.<sup>2,</sup><sup>3</sup>

STR1VE-EU was distinct in its broadened inclusion and exclusion criteria of enrolled patients compared with START or STR1VE-US. Some patients in STR1VE-EU had a more severe disease at baseline, including lower CHOP INTEND scores and the need for nutritional and ventilatory support.<sup>5</sup> Of the 33 patients enrolled, nine (27%) required feeding support, an additional nine (27%) required ventilatory support and five (15%) required both at baseline.<sup>5</sup>

STR1VE-EU (n=33) final results:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Thirty-three patients were enrolled; and 32 patients completed the study.</li>
 	<li>Twenty-seven of 33 patients (82 percent) achieved developmental motor milestones not observed in the natural history of SMA Type 1.<sup>5</sup></li>
 	<li>Fourteen of 32 patients (44 percent) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population achieved the primary endpoint of sitting independently for =10 seconds, observed at a median age of 15.9 months (7.7–18.6). The patient who was not in the ITT population also achieved this primary outcome measure.<sup>5</sup></li>
 	<li>Twenty-three of 30 patients (77 percent) achieved head control (three already had control at baseline), 19 of 33 (58 percent) rolled from back to sides and 16 patients (49 percent) sat without support for =30 seconds, including all patients who met the primary endpoint of sitting without support for =10 seconds.<sup>5</sup></li>
 	<li>In addition, two patients stood with assistance, and one crawled, stood, pulled to stand, and walked without assistance, all by 18 months of age.<sup>5</sup></li>
 	<li>Thirty-one of 32 patients (97 percent) achieved the secondary efficacy endpoint of survival, free from permanent ventilatory support at 14 months,<sup>5</sup> compared with a quarter of patients (26 percent) in the PNCR natural history cohort.<sup>6</sup></li>
 	<li>The majority of patients (73 percent) achieved a CHOP INTEND score of =40 points, 14 (42 percent) achieved a score of =50 points and three (9 percent) achieved a score of =58 points.<sup>5</sup> According to natural history, untreated patients with SMA Type 1 almost never achieve a CHOP INTEND score =40.<sup>6</sup></li>
 	<li>Thirteen of 33 patients (39 percent) remained independent of any type of daily ventilatory support at 18 months of age,<sup>5</sup> compared with none in the PNCR data set.<sup>6</sup></li>
 	<li>Of the nine patients who required ventilatory support at baseline, two achieved independence, and of the 24 patients who did not require ventilatory support at baseline, a majority of patients (67 percent) remained free from this support at the end of the study.<sup>5</sup></li>
</ul>
The exploratory endpoint of the “ability to thrive” in symptomatic patients, inclusive of swallowing, feeding and age-appropriate weight maintenance, was also evaluated.<sup>5</sup> Twenty-three patients were in the ability to thrive population, of which seven (30 percent) met the criteria of ability to thrive at 18 months of age,<sup>5</sup> compared with none reported in the PNCR study.<sup>6</sup> Improvements in each component of the ability to thrive composite endpoint were observed. Age-appropriate weight maintenance was experienced by almost two-thirds of patients (65 percent) (greater than the third percentile for age and sex as defined by WHO guidelines) at 18 months.<sup>5</sup> Of the nine patients who required feeding support at baseline, four were free of feeding support at 18 months of age, and of the 23 patients in the ability to thrive population, 20 (87 percent) were fed exclusively by mouth and remained free from support at the end of the study.<sup>5</sup> Nine patients (39 percent) could tolerate thin liquids.<sup>5</sup>

As previously reported, one patient experienced a serious AE of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage and respiratory distress that resulted in death. Novartis and the investigator concluded the events and death to be unrelated to treatment with Zolgensma based on autopsy findings. Thirty-two of 33 patients were reported to have had at least one AE, of whom six experienced 13 serious adverse events concluded by the investigator to be related to Zolgensma.<sup>5</sup> Reported adverse reactions in patients receiving Zolgensma were consistent with the previously described safety profile, and no new safety signals were identified.

Novartis Gene Therapies is grateful to the patients and families who take part in clinical trials, and reaffirms its commitment to using science-based innovation to improve outcomes for patients with SMA and address the unmet medical needs of SMA.

<strong>About Zolgensma</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (onasemnogene abeparvovec)</strong>
Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) is the only gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and the only SMA treatment designed to directly address the genetic root cause of the disease by replacing the function of the missing or non-working SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time IV infusion. Zolgensma represents the first approved therapeutic in Novartis Gene Therapies’ proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy. Zolgensma was approved in the U.S. in May 2019 and subsequently has been approved in 40 countries. To date, more than 1,200 patients have been treated with Zolgensma globally across clinical trials, managed access programs, and in the commercial setting.<sup>1</sup>

<strong>About Spinal Muscular Atrophy</strong>
SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death.<sup>7,8</sup> If left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two years in more than 90% of cases.<sup>2,3</sup> SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional <em>SMN1</em> gene, resulting in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement.<sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>7</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>9</sup> It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression.<sup>9</sup> This is especially critical in SMA Type 1, where motor neuron degeneration starts before birth and escalates quickly. Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so patients with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities.<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> If left untreated, more than 30% of patients with SMA Type 2 will die by age 25.<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>

TOKYO &amp; NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eisai Co., Ltd. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) announced today that the companies have entered into an exclusive global strategic collaboration agreement for the co-development and co-commercialization of MORAb-202, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). MORAb-202 is Eisai’s first ADC and combines Eisai’s in house developed anti-folate receptor alpha (FRa) antibody, and Eisai’s anticancer agent eribulin, using an enzyme cleavable linker. It is a potential best-in-class FRa ADC with a favorable pharmacology profile and demonstrated single agent activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. Eisai is currently investigating MORAb-202 in FRa-positive solid tumors (inclusive of endometrial, ovarian, lung and breast cancers) in two studies: a Phase 1 clinical study in Japan and a Phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States. The companies are planning to move into the registrational stage of development for this asset as early as next year.

Under the agreement, Eisai and Bristol Myers Squibb will jointly develop and commercialize MORAb-202 in the following collaboration territories: Japan; China; countries in the Asia-Pacific region*; the United States; Canada; Europe, including the European Union and the United Kingdom; and Russia. Bristol Myers Squibb will be solely responsible for developing and commercializing the drug in regions outside of the collaboration territories. Eisai will remain responsible for the manufacturing and supply of MORAb-202 globally.

Under the financial terms of the agreement, Bristol Myers Squibb will pay $650 million U.S. dollars to Eisai including $200 million U.S. dollars as payment toward Eisai research and development expenses. Eisai is also entitled to receive up to $2.45 billion U.S. dollars in potential future development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. The parties will share profits, research and development and commercialization costs in the collaboration territories and Bristol Myers Squibb will pay Eisai a royalty on sales outside of the collaboration territories. Eisai is expected to book sales of MORAb-202 in Japan, China, countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and Russia. Bristol Myers Squibb is expected to book sales of MORAb-202 in the United States and Canada.

“MORAb-202 combines Eisai’s in-house discovered antibody and payload using the company's advanced chemistry capabilities.” said Haruo Naito, Chief Executive Officer at Eisai. “It is characterized by its payload of eribulin, which is a product of our modern synthetic organic chemistry that has already made contributions to patients with breast cancer and soft tissue sarcoma. Our collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb will accelerate the development of MORAb-202 with the goal of bringing a potentially impactful treatment option to patients globally.”

<b>About MORAb-202</b>

MORAb-202 is Eisai’s first antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that is composed of Eisai’s in-house developed anticancer agent farletuzumab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to the folate receptor alpha (FRa), and Eisai’s in-house developed anticancer agent eribulin, using an enzyme cleavable linker. Eisai is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical study in Japan and a Phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States, respectively, for MORAb-202 targeting FRa-positive solid tumors. After MORAb-202 enters the target FRa-positive cancer cells, the linker is enzymatically cleaved, releasing eribulin from the antibody leading to its antitumor activity. Furthermore, in non-clinical studies, MORAb-202 demonstrated a bystander effect, with antitumor activity on the FRa-negative cancer cells surrounding the FRa-positive cancer cells.

The payload eribulin (product name: Halaven) is the first in the halichondrin class of microtubule dynamics inhibitors with a novel mechanism of action. Structurally eribulin is a simplified and synthetically produced version of halichondrin B, a natural product isolated from the marine sponge <i>Halichondria okadai</i>, and functions by inhibiting the growth phase of microtubule dynamics which prevents cell division. Eribulin is currently approved for use in the treatment of breast cancer in over 75 countries worldwide, including Japan, the United States, Europe, China, and other countries in Asia. Furthermore, eribulin is approved for use in the treatment of liposarcoma (soft tissue sarcoma in Japan) in over 75 countries worldwide, including Japan, the United States, as well as countries in Europe and Asia.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160), a global biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative medicines worldwide, today announced that BRUKINSA<sup>®</sup> (zanubrutinib) has received conditional approval from the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy. The supplemental new drug application was previously granted priority review by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the NMPA in October 2020.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“With NMPA approval for BRUKINSA, our next generation BTK inhibitor, we are proud to be able to offer patients, their families, and physicians a new option for treating WM, an incurable disease that can cause significant morbidities,” said Xiaobin Wu, Ph.D., General Manager of China and President of BeiGene. “This marks BRUKINSA’s third approval for the treatment of B-cell malignancies in China, and we believe it may serve an important role in addressing unmet needs for patients with blood cancers around the world.”

“WM often impacts older adults, and tolerability is a particular concern for these patients as longer duration of treatment has the potential to improve outcomes,” said Lugui Qiu, M.D., Professor, Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, and a clinical trial leading principal investigator of BRUKINSA. “As shown in the trial, patients in China will now have access to an innovative treatment that offers cardiovascular safety advantages and deep and durable responses.”

“BRUKINSA was specifically designed by BeiGene scientists to limit off-target effects seen with first-generation BTK inhibitors and we have built a broad clinical development program to assess clinical benefit, including the head-to-head ASPEN trial,” said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Hematology, BeiGene. “We are grateful to all of the patients and clinicians who participated in the trial and hope to increase access for additional people impacted by WM and other hematologic malignancies as we advance global registration for BRUKINSA.”

The conditional approval granted by the NMPA was based on findings from a single-arm pivotal Phase 2 trial (NCT03332173) in China evaluating the safety and efficacy of BRUKINSA in patients with WM who have received at least one prior therapy. With a median study follow-up time of 14.9 months, the primary endpoint of major response rate (MRR) as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) was 72.1% (95% CI: 56.3, 84.7); MRR is defined as the combined rate of complete responses, very good partial responses, and partial responses. The adverse reaction profile was generally consistent with previous findings.

The recommended total daily dose of BRUKINSA for WM in China is 320mg.

<b>About Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia</b>

Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia is a rare, slow-growing lymphoma that occurs in less than two percent of patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).<sup> 1</sup> The disease usually affects older adults and is primarily found in the bone marrow, although it may also impact lymph nodes and the spleen.<sup>2</sup> In China, there are an estimated 88,200 patients diagnosed with lymphoma each year. Approximately 91% of these cases are classified as NHL, amounting to ~1,000 newly diagnosed WM patients per year in China.<sup>3</sup>

<b>About BRUKINSA<sup>®</sup> (zanubrutinib)</b>

BRUKINSA is a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) discovered by BeiGene scientists that is currently being evaluated globally in a broad clinical program as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various B-cell malignancies. Because new BTK is continuously synthesized, BRUKINSA was specifically designed to deliver complete and sustained inhibition of the BTK protein by optimizing bioavailability, half-life, and selectivity. With differentiated pharmacokinetics compared to other approved BTK inhibitors, BRUKINSA has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of malignant B cells within a number of disease relevant tissues.

BRUKINSA is approved in the following indications and regions:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>For the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy (United States, November 2019)*;</li>
 	<li>For the treatment of MCL in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy (China, June 2020)**;</li>
 	<li>For the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy (China, June 2020)**;</li>
 	<li>For the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy (China, June 2021)**;</li>
 	<li>For the treatment of relapsed or refractory MCL (United Arab Emirates, February 2021); and</li>
 	<li>For the treatment of WM in adult patients (Canada, March 2021).</li>
</ul>
To-date, more than 30 marketing authorization applications in multiple indications have been submitted outside of the United States and China, covering countries in the European Union and more than 20 other countries.

* This indication was approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

** This indication was approved under conditional approval. Complete approval for this indication may be contingent upon results from ongoing randomized, controlled confirmatory clinical trials.

<b>IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION FOR BRUKINSA (ZANUBRUTINIB)</b>

<b>Warnings and Precautions</b>

<b>Hemorrhage</b>

Fatal and serious hemorrhagic events have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria and hemothorax have been reported in 2% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Bleeding events of any grade, including purpura and petechiae, occurred in 50% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy.

Bleeding events have occurred in patients with and without concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Co-administration of BRUKINSA with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications may further increase the risk of hemorrhage.

Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Discontinue BRUKINSA if intracranial hemorrhage of any grade occurs. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding BRUKINSA for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.

<b>Infections</b>

Fatal and serious infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) and opportunistic infections have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 23% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. The most common Grade 3 or higher infection was pneumonia. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation have occurred.

Consider prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and other infections according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever or other signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately.

<b>Cytopenias</b>

Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (27%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and anemia (8%) based on laboratory measurements, were reported in patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy.

Monitor complete blood counts during treatment and treat using growth factor or transfusions, as needed.

<b>Second Primary Malignancies</b>

Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinoma, have occurred in 9% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. The most frequent second primary malignancy was skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of skin), reported in 6% of patients. Advise patients to use sun protection.

<b>Cardiac Arrhythmias</b>

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have occurred in 2% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, and acute infections may be at increased risk. Grade 3 or higher events were reported in 0.6% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Monitor signs and symptoms for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage as appropriate.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on findings in animals, BRUKINSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity, including malformations at exposures that were 5 times higher than those reported in patients at the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking BRUKINSA and for at least 1 week after the last dose. Advise men to avoid fathering a child during treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.

<b>Adverse Reactions</b>

The most common adverse reactions in &gt; 10% of patients who received BRUKINSA were neutrophil count decreased (53%), platelet count decreased (39%), upper respiratory tract infection (38%), white blood cell count decreased (30%), hemoglobin decreased (29%), rash (25%), bruising (23%), diarrhea (20%), cough (20%), musculoskeletal pain (19%), pneumonia (18%), urinary tract infection (13%), hematuria (12%), fatigue (11%), constipation (11%), and hemorrhage (10%). The most frequent serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (11%) and hemorrhage (5%).

Of the 118 patients with MCL treated with BRUKINSA, 8 (7%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the trials. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was pneumonia (3.4%). One (0.8%) patient experienced an adverse reaction leading to dose reduction (hepatitis B).

<b>Drug Interactions</b>

<b>CYP3A Inhibitors:</b> When BRUKINSA is co-administered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg once daily. For co-administration with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, reduce BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg twice daily.

<b>CYP3A Inducers:</b> Avoid co-administration with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers.

<b>Specific Populations</b>

<b>Hepatic Impairment: </b>The recommended dose of BRUKINSA for patients with severe hepatic impairment is 80 mg orally twice daily.

<b>INDICATION</b>

BRUKINSA is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Berlin, June 21, 2021 – Bayer today announced the submission of a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of the novel combination of the cancer treatments copanlisib and rituximab. The U.S. submission is for the treatment of patients with relapsed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B-iNHL). In the EU, Bayer has filed for the treatment of relapsed marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), a subtype of iNHL, and the filing has been accepted. Bayer has previously received an orphan drug designation (ODD) for MZL in the EU. The submissions are supported by positive results from the Phase III trial CHRONOS-3, which were presented in April at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2021, and simultaneously published in The Lancet Oncology. Indolent NHL consists of the following subtypes, follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM).

“The U.S. and EU submissions of the novel combination of copanlisib and rituximab bring us forward in advancing new treatment approaches and addressing unmet needs of patients with different types of relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,” said Scott Z. Fields, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology Development at Bayer. “We are excited about the potential of this combination therapy based on the findings from CHRONOS-3 and we look forward to working with global regulatory authorities.”

Additionally, the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designations (ODD) for copanlisib in CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and LPL/WM. Copanlisib has been previously granted an ODD in the U.S. for FL and MZL.

Copanlisib, the only pan class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, is already approved in the U.S., Israel and Taiwan as a monotherapy under the brand name Aliqopa™ for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed FL who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. These approvals are based on the results of a single-arm, multi-center, Phase II clinical trial (CHRONOS-1). In China, the filing for this indication was granted priority review. Bayer plans to seek additional filings worldwide based on the data from CHRONOS-3.

About CHRONOS-3
CHRONOS-3 is a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the objective to evaluate whether copanlisib in combination with rituximab is superior to placebo plus rituximab in extending progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed iNHL following at least one prior rituximab-containing therapy. Patients who had a progression-free and treatment-free interval of at least 12 months after completion of the last rituximab-containing regimen or patients unwilling/unfit or for whom chemotherapy was contraindicated by reason of age, co-morbidities and/or residual toxicity were included.

Data from CHRONOS-3 showed a significant improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS with the combination of copanlisib and rituximab given intravenously compared to the combination of rituximab and placebo. The adverse event (AE) profile of the combination was generally consistent with previously published data on the individual components of the combination and no new safety signals were identified.

About non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) comprises a highly heterogeneous group of chronic diseases with poor prognosis. NHL is the most common hematologic malignancy and the tenth most common cancer worldwide, with about 510,000 new cases diagnosed in 2018. It accounts for about 250,000 deaths per year worldwide.

Indolent NHL consists of multiple subtypes, including follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM). While the disease is typically slow growing, it can become more aggressive over time. Despite treatment advances, there remains a need for improved and differentiated treatment options for the relapsed or refractory stage of the disease. After response to initial therapy, response rates and duration of response decline with subsequent lines of therapy, underscoring the need for patients whose disease has already progressed.

About Copanlisib (Aliqopa™)
Developed by Bayer, copanlisib is the only pan class I PI3K inhibitor with inhibitory activity against all four isoforms including the PI3K-alpha and PI3K-delta isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. It is also the only PI3K inhibitor administered intravenously on an intermittent schedule, allowing effective inhibition of the PI3K pathway in tumor cells while limiting toxicity to healthy cells. The PI3K pathway is involved in cell growth, survival and metabolism, and aberrant activation and is occurring across different solid and hematological tumor types, including all subtypes of iNHL. Its dysregulation plays an important role in lymphoma.

Copanlisib is currently approved in the U.S., Israel and Taiwan as a monotherapy under the brand name Aliqopa™ for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Approvals were based on an overall response rate (ORR) of 59%, including 14% of complete responses (CRs) from the open-label, single-arm Phase II CHRONOS-1 (NCT01660451) trial of copanlisib monotherapy in 104 adult patients with follicular B-cell NHL who had relapsed disease following at least two prior systemic therapies (1) Updated data for CHRONOS-1, published in the American Journal of Hematology in 2020, showed an ORR of 59% including 20% of CRs in patients with follicular B-cell NHL. (2) In China, the filing for this indication was granted priority review. The compound has also received a breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. and China for marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) based on clinical data of MZL patients enrolled in the CHRONOS-1 study.

Bayer plans to seek additional filings worldwide based on the data from CHRONOS-3.

The clinical development program for copanlisib also includes the Phase III study CHRONOS-4, evaluating copanlisib in combination with standard immunochemotherapy in relapsed iNHL. More information about this trial can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

PASADENA, Calif. &amp; DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARWR) and Horizon Therapeutics plc (NASDAQ: HZNP) today announced a global collaboration and license agreement for ARO-XDH, a previously undisclosed discovery-stage investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic being developed by Arrowhead as a potential treatment for people with uncontrolled gout.

Gout is a serious and painful form of arthritis that is caused by excess uric acid in the blood. In the United States, there are more than nine million gout patients and approximately a third of those patients are treated with oral urate-lowering therapies. However, a meaningful portion of treated patients do not respond sufficiently to treatment and therefore continue to experience painful and debilitating gout symptoms. XDH represents a clinically validated target that is the primary source of serum uric acid (sUA). High levels of sUA, if left untreated or undertreated, can potentially lead to serious long-term or even permanent damage to the bones, joints and organs.

Under the terms of the agreement, Arrowhead will conduct all activities through preclinical stages of development of the siRNA therapeutic. Horizon will receive a worldwide exclusive license to the therapeutic and will be wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization. Arrowhead will receive $40 million as an upfront payment from Horizon and is eligible to receive up to $660 million in potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones, and is further eligible to receive royalties in the low- to mid-teens range on net product sales.

“We believe Horizon’s expertise in the clinical development and commercialization of therapies for gout makes them an ideal partner. We look forward to working closely with Horizon as we advance this potential new therapy for patients in need,” said Christopher Anzalone, Ph.D., Arrowhead’s president and CEO. “This collaboration with Horizon also represents further expansion of our rapidly growing pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics that utilize Arrowhead’s proprietary Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiM<sup>TM</sup>) platform.”

“As a commercial and clinical leader in gout, we understand the disease and its impact, and that there is still a tremendous unmet treatment need,” said Tim Walbert, chairman, president and CEO, Horizon. “The collaboration with Arrowhead adds an additional program to our research and development focus to discover and develop new, innovative medicines that continue to improve gout treatment across the continuum of care.”

<b>About Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals</b>

Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep, and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Arrowhead’s RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","SAN FRANCISCO and SUZHOU, China, June 20, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (“Innovent”) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that data from the ORIENT-32 study have been published in The Lancet Oncology.

Led by Professor Fan Jia from Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, ORIENT-32 is a Phase 2/3 randomized, open label, multi-center study conducted in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in combination with the bevacizumab biosimilar IBI305 compared to sorafenib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

In January 2021, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China accepted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for sintilimab in combination with bevacizumab biosimilar as first-line therapy for patients with HCC.

Professor Fan Jia stated: “ORIENT-32 is the first large-scale study to show the benefit of first-line treatment in HBV-associated HCC with combination immunotherapy. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the collaborative joint effort of the ORIENT-32 trial investigators and patients enabled us to successfully reach this milestone. We hope these results can help to provide a new treatment option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.”

Dr. Zhou Hui, Senior Vice President of Clinical Development of Innovent, stated: “ORIENT-32 is the first hepatocellular carcinoma study in the world of a PD-1 inhibitor-based combination therapy to achieve its primary endpoint of overall survival. We are pleased that these study results have been published in The Lancet Oncology and hope to bring this regimen as a new treatment option for Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in the near future. Moreover, we are encouraged that our development of cancer therapies is helping to achieve the Healthy China 2030 goal.”

About the ORIENT-32 Study

Background

China has a high burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection as the major cause. People with HCC have a poor prognosis and a substantial unmet clinical need1.  The ORIENT-32 study assessed sintilimab in combination with bevacizumab biosimilar, compared to sorafenib, in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable HBV-associated HCC.

Methods

This randomized, open label study was conducted at 50 clinical trial sites in China. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically diagnosed or clinically confirmed unresectable or metastatic HCC with no previous systemic treatment and a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible for inclusion.

In the safety lead-in phase, patients received intravenous sintilimab (200 mg every 3 weeks) plus intravenous bevacizumab biosimilar (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). In the Phase 3 study, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar (the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily; the sorafenib group), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was done using permuted block randomization, with a block size of six, via an interactive web response system, and stratified by macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis, baseline a-fetoprotein, and ECOG performance status. In the lead-in phase of the study, safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. After reviewing the safety findings from the safety lead-in phase, the study was conducted with the primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and independent radiological review committee (IRRC)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03794440.

The study is closed to new participants and follow-up is ongoing for long-term outcomes.

Findings

Between February 11, 2019 and January 15, 2020, 595 patients were enrolled: 24 were enrolled directly into the safety lead-in component and 571 were randomly assigned to receive the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar combination (n=380) or sorafenib (n=191). 24 patients received at least one dose of the study drug, with an objective response rate of 25.0 percent (95% CI 9.8–46.7). Based on the preliminary safety and activity findings of the lead in portion, in which =grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in seven (29%) of 24 patients, the randomized portion was initiated.

At data cutoff (August 15, 2020), the median follow-up was 10.0 months (IQR 8.5–11.7) in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group and 10.0 months (8.4–11.7) in the sorafenib group. Patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group had a significantly longer IRRC-assessed median PFS (4.6 months [95% CI 4.1–5.7]) than did patients in the sorafenib group (2.8 months [2.7–3.2]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.46–0.70; p<0.0001).

In the first interim analysis of OS, patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group showed a significantly longer median OS than did patients in the sorafenib group (median not reached [95% CI not reached–not reached] vs 10.4 months [8.5–not reached]; HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43–0.75; p<0.0001).

The most common grade 3–4 TRAEs were hypertension (55 [14%] of 380 patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group vs. 11 [6%] of 191 patients in the sorafenib group) and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (none vs. 22 [12%]). 123 (32%) patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group and 36 (19%) patients in the sorafenib group had serious adverse events. TRAEs that led to death occurred in six (2%) patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group and two (1%) patients in the sorafenib group.

Conclusions

Sintilimab in combination with bevacizumab biosimilar IBI305 showed significant improvements in OS and PFS compared to sorafenib in the first-line treatment of Chinese patients with unresectable, HBV-associated HCC, with no new safety signals. This combination regimen could provide a novel treatment option for such patients.

About Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Primary liver cancer (PLC) is a common malignancy of the digestive system worldwide, among which about half of all new cases and deaths occur in China. The main pathological types of liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which accounts for 85 to 90 percent, and a small number of cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and HCC-ICC mixed liver cancer. In China, HCC is primarily caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

About Sintilimab

Sintilimab, marketed as TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in China, is an innovative PD-1 inhibitor with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Eli Lilly and Company. Sintilimab is an immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1 / PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies of sintilimab to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials.

In China, sintilimab has been approved for three indications, including:

The treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy
In combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer
In combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer
Additionally, Innovent currently has regulatory submissions under review in China for sintilimab:

In combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab injection) for the first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma
The second-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer
In May 2021, the U.S. FDA accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Sintilimab was included in China’s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in 2019 as the first PD-1 inhibitor and the only PD-1 included in the list in that year.

About BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection)

BYVASDA®, also known as IBI305, is a bevacizumab biosimilar and a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important factor in angiogenesis that is highly expressed by the endothelial cells in most human tumors. An anti-VEGF antibody binds VEGF-A selectively with high affinity and blocks its binding to VEGF-2 receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt/PKB and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK. BYVASDA® produces anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the growth, proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, blocking angiogenesis, reducing vascular permeability, blocking blood supply to tumor tissues, inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Since its launch, bevacizumab has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in these tumor types have been well recognized worldwide.

BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) was firstly approved by the China NMPA on June 17, 2020. Approved indications of BYVASDA® include advanced non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. In December 2020, it was also approved by the NMPA for the indication of adult recurrent glioblastoma.

AstraZeneca<i> </i>and MSD's<i> Koselugo</i> (selumetinib) has been granted conditional approval in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) aged three years and above.

NF1 is a debilitating genetic condition affecting one in 3,000 individuals worldwide.<sup>1,2</sup> In 30-50% of people with NF1, tumours develop on the nerve sheaths (plexiform neurofibromas) and can cause clinical issues such as disfigurement, motor dysfunction, pain, airway dysfunction, visual impairment and bladder or bowel dysfunction.<sup>3-7</sup>

The approval by the European Commission was based on positive results from the SPRINT Stratum 1 Phase II trial sponsored by the National Institute of Health's National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP). This trial showed <i>Koselugo</i> reduced the size of inoperable tumours in children, reducing pain and improving quality of life.<sup>7,8</sup> This is the first approval of a medicine for NF1 PN in the EU and follows the positive <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/selumetinib-recommended-for-eu-approval-in-nf1.html"">recommendation</a> by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency in April 2021. Safety and efficacy data from the SPRINT Phase II trial with longer follow up will be provided as one of the conditions of approval.

Brigitte C. Widemann, MD, Principal Investigator of the SPRINT trial and Chief, NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch, said: ""For children with neurofibromatosis type 1, plexiform neurofibromas can grow and develop so significantly that, in some cases, it becomes debilitating. In the SPRINT trial, selumetinib shrank NF1-associated PNs in 66% of patients and showed clinically meaningful improvements in PN-related symptoms.""

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: ""As the first medicine approved in the EU for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, <i>Koselugo</i> has the potential to transform the way plexiform neurofibromas are managed and treated. The SPRINT data showed that <i>Koselugo</i> not only shrank tumours in some children, but also reduced pain and improved their quality of life. This significant milestone was made possible thanks to our research partners, the National Cancer Institute, the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program, the Children's Tumor Foundation, the patient community and every child, parent and doctor involved in the clinical trial.""

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: ""Before this approval, surgery was the only treatment option for children in the EU with neurofibromatosis type 1 plexiform neurofibromas. This approval marks a significant step forward in addressing the debilitating impact of these tumours.""

The SPRINT Stratum 1 Phase II trial showed <i>Koselugo</i> demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 66% (33 of 50 patients, confirmed partial response) in paediatric patients with NF1 PN when treated with <i>Koselugo</i> as twice-daily oral monotherapy.<sup>8</sup> ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed complete (disappearance of PN) or partial response (at least 20% reduction in tumour volume).<sup>8</sup> Results were published in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1912735"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>.<sup>7</sup>

<i>Koselugo</i> is <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/koselugo-selumetinib-approved-in-us-for-paediatric-patients-with-neurofibromatosis-type-1-plexiform-neurofibromas.html"">approved</a> in the US and several other countries for the treatment of paediatric patients with NF1 and symptomatic, inoperable PN. Further regulatory submissions are underway. Clinical trials of <i>Koselugo</i> in adult patients with NF1 PN, including an alternative age-appropriate formulation for paediatric patients, are scheduled to begin this year.

<b>NF1
</b>NF1 is caused by a spontaneous or inherited mutation in the NF1 gene and is associated with many symptoms, including soft lumps on and under the skin (cutaneous neurofibromas) and skin pigmentation (so-called 'café au lait' spots). In 30-50% of people, tumours develop on the nerve sheaths.<sup>1,3,9,10</sup> These PN can cause clinical issues such as pain, motor dysfunction, airway dysfunction, bladder/bowel dysfunction and disfigurement, as well as having the potential to transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours.<sup>4-7,10</sup> PN begin developing during early childhood, with varying degrees of severity, and can reduce life expectancy by eight to 15 years.<sup>3,6,11,12</sup>

<b>SPRINT
</b>The SPRINT Stratum 1 Phase II trial was designed to evaluate the objective response rate and impact on patient-reported and functional outcomes in paediatric patients with NF1-related inoperable PNs treated with selumetinib monotherapy.<sup>7</sup> This trial sponsored by NCI CTEP was conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between NCI and AstraZeneca with additional support from Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP).

<b><i>Koselugo
</i></b><i>Koselugo</i> (selumetinib) is an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2).<sup>8</sup> MEK1/2 proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. Both MEK and ERK are critical components of the RAS-regulated RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, which is often activated in different types of cancers.<sup>13</sup>

<i>Koselugo</i> received US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation in April 2019, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in December 2019 and US Orphan Drug Designation in February 2018. Further orphan designations have been granted in the EU, Japan, Russia, Switzerland, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia.

<b>AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration
</b>In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise <i>Lynparza</i>, the world's first PARP inhibitor, and <i>Koselugo</i> (selumetinib), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and <i>Koselugo</i> in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and <i>Koselugo</i> in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”), with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, and Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: HALO) today announced a global collaboration and license agreement that gives exclusive access to Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology, recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 enzyme (rHuPH20), for specific targets used in the treatment and prevention of HIV.

Under the terms of the agreement, ViiV Healthcare will make an upfront payment of $40 million to Halozyme for the exclusive license to four HIV small and large molecule targets and is obligated to make potential future payments of up to $175 million in development and commercial milestones per target, subject to achievement of specified development and commercial milestones, including certain specified sales milestones. Halozyme will also be entitled to receive mid-single digit royalties on sales of commercialised medicines using the technology.

The PH20 enzyme breaks down a substance called hyaluronan (HA) that is found in the body’s subcutaneous space (under the skin) that acts as a barrier to the flow of fluid. By breaking down HA locally at the injection site and temporarily removing that barrier, large amounts of fluid can be injected into the subcutaneous space and dispersed. This facilitates the rapid delivery of large volume fluids by subcutaneous injection, potentially reducing the treatment burden of injectable drugs and providing optimised treatment options to patients. The HA is restored under the skin via normal processes within 24-48 hours.

Halozyme’s technology provides ViiV Healthcare with more opportunities to develop ultra long- acting medicines (dosing intervals of three months or longer) with its long-acting portfolio and pipeline products. Plans are underway to initiate the first experiments with the technology by the end of 2021 for investigational, long-acting cabotegravir for prevention of HIV, which is currently administered every two months.

“Many people living with HIV and those vulnerable to HIV tell us that for a variety of reasons, taking medicine every day is a challenge, and we have listened to them,” said <strong>Kimberly Smith, M.D., MPH, Head of Research &amp; Development at ViiV Healthcare. </strong> “We believe long-acting medicines are the future of HIV therapies and will help address these unmet needs. Our collaboration with Halozyme will keep us at the forefront of developing additional, innovative new options for HIV treatment and prevention as we work towards reducing the burden of HIV treatment.”

“We are excited to partner with ViiV Healthcare to create new delivery options for innovative medicines for HIV,” said <strong>Helen Torley, M.B. Ch. B., M.R.C.P., president and chief executive officer, Halozyme</strong>. “This collaboration demonstrates the potential value of our technology to facilitate rapid, large volume subcutaneous injections of not only more traditional medicines but also long-acting injectables, including small molecules, which in turn may further extend dosing intervals for people taking medicines for the treatment and prevention of HIV.”

The license gives ViiV exclusive use of Halozyme’s proprietary rHuPH20 technology for four, specific HIV medicine targets that will expand opportunities for development of nearly all of ViiV’s pipeline assets. These assets are integrase inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors limited to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitors (NRTTIs), capsid inhibitors and broadly neutralising monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs), that bind to the gp120 CD4 binding site.

Halozyme has licensed its technology to 11 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for potential use in oncology, autoimmune disease, rare disease and infectious disease with products currently approved in oncology and immune deficiency indications. In addition, Halozyme currently has a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Vaccine Research Center in the US, which includes a bNAb, N6LS, that ViiV Healthcare licensed from the National Institutes of Health in 2019.

GlaxoSmithKline plc and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. today announced final, confirmatory results from the Phase 3 COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial – Intent to Care Early) trial demonstrating that sotrovimab, an investigational SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody, significantly reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death among high-risk adult outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Additionally, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) updated its COVID-19 treatment guidelines to recommend sotrovimab for non-hospitalised patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of clinical progression and noted that sotrovimab appears to retain activity against current variants of concern and interest.

The primary efficacy analysis of all 1,057 patients in the COMET-ICE trial demonstrated a 79% reduction (adjusted relative risk reduction) (p&lt;0.001) in hospitalisation for more than 24 hours or death due to any cause, by Day 29 compared to placebo, meeting the primary endpoint of the trial.

The number of patients in the trial who were hospitalised for &gt;24 hours for acute management of any illness or death from any cause at Day 29 was six patients in the sotrovimab arm (1%), versus 30 patients in the placebo arm (6%). In the sotrovimab arm, it is possible that half of those patients who were hospitalised were for reasons other than progression of COVID-19 (e.g., small bowel obstruction, lung cancer and diabetic foot ulcer); this was not the case for patients in the placebo arm. In the safety analysis, 1,037 participants were followed through at least 29 days. The most common adverse events observed in the sotrovimab treatment group in COMET-ICE were rash (1%) and diarrhoea (2%), all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate). No other treatment-emergent adverse events were reported at a higher rate with sotrovimab compared to placebo. The companies plan to submit the full COMET-ICE data set to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.

<strong>Christopher Corsico, Senior Vice President, Development, GSK, said:</strong> “Effective medicines to treat those who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain a critical part of the solution to this pandemic. We are working diligently to increase access to sotrovimab in the U.S. and across the globe, including evaluating the potential to simplify administration with an intramuscular formulation.”

<strong>George Scangos, PhD, chief executive officer of Vir, said: </strong>“We are pleased that the profound interim efficacy from the COMET-ICE trial has now been validated by the full study population. These results, combined with the growing number of pending global authorizations, as well as the recent recommendation by the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel, support our confidence in the potential role of sotrovimab in the fight against this pandemic.”
<h3>Updated NIH Guidelines Recommend Sotrovimab</h3>
The NIH recently updated its <a href=""https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/statement-on-anti-sars-cov-2-monoclonal-antibodies-eua/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">guidelines</a> regarding the emergency use authorisations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 in the U.S. to recommend the use of sotrovimab for non-hospitalised patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of clinical progression. The guidelines note that the target binding site of sotrovimab is in a region of the virus that does not overlap with the binding site location of key mutations in current variants of concern and interest. These guidelines were based upon an interim analysis of 583 patients in the COMET-ICE trial, which was stopped early in March 2020 by an independent data monitoring committee because interim results demonstrated evidence of sotrovimab’s clinical efficacy. The interim study results demonstrated an 85% (p=0.002) reduction in hospitalisation for more than 24 hours or death in those receiving sotrovimab compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial.

These data have informed global regulatory reviews to date, including the <a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/ema-issues-positive-scientific-opinion-on-gsk-and-vir-biotechnology-s-sotrovimab-for-the-early-treatment-of-covid-19/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">positive scientific opinion</a> issued by the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) under Article 5(3) of Regulation 726/2004, as well as the <a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-and-vir-biotechnology-announce-sotrovimab-vir-7831-receives-emergency-use-authorization-from-the-us-fda/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Emergency Use Authorisation</a> (EUA) granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The companies are actively working with government agencies around the world to make sotrovimab available to patients in need of treatment.
<ul>
 	<li>GSK and Vir plan to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA in the second half of 2021.</li>
 	<li>The EMA has started a rolling review of data on sotrovimab that will continue until enough evidence is available to support the filing of a formal marketing authorisation application.</li>
 	<li>The companies’ strategic manufacturing network is enabling the manufacture of approximately two million doses to support emergency supply in the first year following U.S. Emergency Use Authorisation, with approximately 450,000 doses on hand.</li>

Data from in vitro studies, published in <a href=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.434607v3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">bioRxiv</a>, have demonstrated that sotrovimab maintains activity against circulating variants of concern and interest, including the Gamma (P.1), Epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429), Delta (B.1.617.2), Iota (B.1.526), Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) variants. GSK and Vir are continuing to evaluate the ability of sotrovimab to maintain activity against new and emerging variants through in vitro studies. The clinical impact of this in vitro variants data is not yet known.
<h3>About Sotrovimab (previously VIR-7831)</h3>
Sotrovimab is an investigational SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. Sotrovimab, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend™ technology, also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life.

The following is a summary of information for sotrovimab. Healthcare providers in the U.S. should review the Fact Sheets for information on the authorised use of sotrovimab and mandatory requirements of the EUA. Please see the <a href=""https://www.sotrovimab.com/content/dam/cf-pharma/hcp-sotrovimab/sotrovimab-fda-letter-of-authorization.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FDA Letter of Authorisation</a>, <a href=""https://gskpro.com/content/dam/global/hcpportal/en_US/Prescribing_Information/Sotrovimab/pdf/SOTROVIMAB-EUA.PDF#nameddest=HCPFS"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-anchor=""#nameddest=HCPFS"">Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers</a>, and <a href=""https://gskpro.com/content/dam/global/hcpportal/en_US/Prescribing_Information/Sotrovimab/pdf/SOTROVIMAB-PATIENT-FACT-SHEET.PDF"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Fact Sheet for Patients, Parents, and Caregivers</a>.

<h3>Important Information about Sotrovimab</h3>
Sotrovimab has been authorized by the FDA for the emergency use described below. Sotrovimab is not FDA-approved for this use.

Sotrovimab is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of sotrovimab under section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.
<h3>Authorized Use</h3>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to permit the emergency use of the unapproved product sotrovimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.
<h3>Limitations of Authorized Use</h3>
Sotrovimab is not authorized for use in patients:
<ul>
 	<li>who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR</li>
 	<li>who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR</li>
 	<li>who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 (in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity).</li>
</ul>
Benefit of treatment with sotrovimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID 19. SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID 19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation.
<h3>Important Safety Information for Sotrovimab</h3>
<h3>Warnings</h3>
There are limited clinical data available for sotrovimab. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with sotrovimab use.
<h3>Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis and Infusion-Related Reactions</h3>
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been observed with administration of sotrovimab. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

Infusion-related reactions, occurring during the infusion and up to 24 hours after the infusion, have been observed with administration of sotrovimab. These reactions may be severe or life threatening.

Signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions may include: fever, difficulty breathing, reduced oxygen saturation, chills, fatigue, arrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia), chest pain or discomfort, weakness, altered mental status, nausea, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, vaso-vagal reactions (eg, pre-syncope, syncope), dizziness and diaphoresis.

Consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care if an infusion-related reaction occurs.

Hypersensitivity reactions occurring more than 24 hours after the infusion have also been reported with the use of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies under Emergency Use Authorization.
<h3>Clinical Worsening After SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibody Administration</h3>
Clinical worsening of COVID 19 after administration of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment has been reported and may include signs or symptoms of fever, hypoxia or increased respiratory difficulty, arrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), fatigue, and altered mental status. Some of these events required hospitalization. It is not known if these events were related to SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody use or were due to progression of COVID 19.
<h3>Limitations of Benefit and Potential for Risk in Patients with Severe COVID 19</h3>
Benefit of treatment with sotrovimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID 19. SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID 19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Therefore, sotrovimab is not authorized for use in patients: who are hospitalized due to COVID 19, OR who require oxygen therapy due to COVID 19, OR who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID 19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non COVID 19 related comorbidity.
<h3>ADVERSE EVENTS</h3>
The most common treatment-emergent adverse events observed in the sotrovimab treatment group in COMET-ICE were rash (2%) and diarrhea (1%), all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate). No other treatment-emergent adverse events were reported at a higher rate with sotrovimab compared to placebo.
<h3>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h3>
<h3>Pregnancy</h3>
There are insufficient data to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcome. Sotrovimab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.
<h3>Lactation</h3>
There are no available data on the presence of sotrovimab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Individuals with COVID-19 who are breastfeeding should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.
<h3>About the Vir and GSK Collaboration</h3>
In April 2020, Vir and GSK entered into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The collaboration uses Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies will leverage GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They will also apply their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.
<h3>GSK Commitment to Tackling COVID-19</h3>
GSK’s response to COVID-19 has been one of the broadest in the industry, with three potential treatments in addition to our vaccine candidates in development with partner organisations.

GSK is collaborating with several organisations on COVID-19 vaccines by providing access to our adjuvant technology. In addition to our work with Medicago, we recently announced positive Phase 2 data from our collaboration with Sanofi to develop an adjuvanted, protein-based vaccine candidate and expect to begin a Phase 3 trial in Q2. An earlier stage collaboration with SK Bioscience is also ongoing. SK Bioscience receives funding from CEPI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop differentiated, affordable COVID-19 vaccines for supply globally through the COVAX facility. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and contributing to protecting more people.

GSK is also working with mRNA specialist, CureVac, to jointly develop next generation, multi-valent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 with the potential to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine. GSK will also support manufacturing of up to 100m doses of CureVac’s first generation COVID-19 vaccine. GSK is also providing manufacturing support for up to 60m doses of Novavax’ COVID-19 vaccine in the UK.

GSK is also exploring potential therapeutic or treatment options for COVID-19 patients. We are collaborating with Vir Biotechnology to develop existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options for COVID-19. We reported that an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the Phase 3 COMET-ICE trial evaluating sotrovimab as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalisation be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy, based on an interim analysis of data from the trial. An analysis of data through Day 29 of the COMET-ICE trial was consistent with interim results. We have received Emergency Use Authorisation in the U.S. and are seeking authorisations in other countries. We are also assessing whether an investigational monoclonal antibody, otilimab, can help severely ill COVID-19 patients aged over 70 who experience an overreaction of their immune system.
<h3>Vir’s Commitment to COVID-19</h3>
Vir was founded with the mission of addressing the world’s most serious infectious diseases. In 2020, Vir responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging our unique scientific insights and industry-leading antibody platform to explore multiple monoclonal antibodies as potential therapeutic or preventive options for COVID-19. Sotrovimab is the first SARS-CoV-2-targeting antibody Vir advanced into the clinic. It was carefully selected for its demonstrated promise in preclinical research, including an anticipated high barrier to resistance and potential ability to both block the virus from entering healthy cells and clear infected cells. Vir is continuing to pursue novel therapeutic and prophylactic solutions to combat SARS-CoV-2 and future coronavirus pandemics, both independently and in collaboration with its partners.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the collaborative joint effort of the ORIENT-32 trial investigators and patients enabled us to successfully reach this milestone. We hope these results can help to provide a new treatment option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.""

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Zhou Hui</span>, Senior Vice President of Clinical Development of Innovent, stated: ""ORIENT-32 is the first hepatocellular carcinoma study in the world of a PD-1 inhibitor-based combination therapy to achieve its primary endpoint of overall survival. We are pleased that these study results have been published in The Lancet Oncology and hope to bring this regimen as a new treatment option for Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in the near future. Moreover, we are encouraged that our development of cancer therapies is helping to achieve the Healthy China 2030 goal.""

<b>About the ORIENT-32 Study</b>

<b>Background</b>

<span class=""xn-location"">China</span> has a high burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection as the major cause. People with HCC have a poor prognosis and a substantial unmet clinical need<sup>1</sup>.  The ORIENT-32 study assessed sintilimab in combination with bevacizumab biosimilar, compared to sorafenib, in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable HBV-associated HCC.

<b>Methods</b>

This randomized, open label study was conducted at 50 clinical trial sites in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically diagnosed or clinically confirmed unresectable or metastatic HCC with no previous systemic treatment and a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible for inclusion.

In the safety lead-in phase, patients received intravenous sintilimab (200 mg every 3 weeks) plus intravenous bevacizumab biosimilar (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). In the Phase 3 study, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar (the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily; the sorafenib group), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was done using permuted block randomization, with a block size of six, via an interactive web response system, and stratified by macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis, baseline a-fetoprotein, and ECOG performance status. In the lead-in phase of the study, safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. After reviewing the safety findings from the safety lead-in phase, the study was conducted with the primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and independent radiological review committee (IRRC)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03794440"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03794440</a>.

The study is closed to new participants and follow-up is ongoing for long-term outcomes.

<b>Findings</b>

Between <span class=""xn-chron"">February 11, 2019</span> and <span class=""xn-chron"">January 15, 2020</span>, 595 patients were enrolled: 24 were enrolled directly into the safety lead-in component and 571 were randomly assigned to receive the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar combination (n=380) or sorafenib (n=191). 24 patients received at least one dose of the study drug, with an objective response rate of 25.0 percent (95% CI 9.8–46.7). Based on the preliminary safety and activity findings of the lead in portion, in which =grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in seven (29%) of 24 patients, the randomized portion was initiated.

At data cutoff (<span class=""xn-chron"">August 15, 2020</span>), the median follow-up was 10.0 months (IQR 8.5–11.7) in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group and 10.0 months (8.4–11.7) in the sorafenib group. Patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group had a significantly longer IRRC-assessed median PFS (4.6 months [95% CI 4.1–5.7]) than did patients in the sorafenib group (2.8 months [2.7–3.2]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.46–0.70; p&lt;0.0001).

In the first interim analysis of OS, patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group showed a significantly longer median OS than did patients in the sorafenib group (median not reached [95% CI not reached–not reached] vs 10.4 months [8.5–not reached]; HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43–0.75; p&lt;0.0001).

The most common grade 3–4 TRAEs were hypertension (55 [14%] of 380 patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group vs. 11 [6%] of 191 patients in the sorafenib group) and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (none vs. 22 [12%]). 123 (32%) patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group and 36 (19%) patients in the sorafenib group had serious adverse events. TRAEs that led to death occurred in six (2%) patients in the sintilimab–bevacizumab biosimilar group and two (1%) patients in the sorafenib group.

<b>Conclusions</b>

Sintilimab in combination with bevacizumab biosimilar IBI305 showed significant improvements in OS and PFS compared to sorafenib in the first-line treatment of Chinese patients with unresectable, HBV-associated HCC, with no new safety signals. This combination regimen could provide a novel treatment option for such patients.

<b>About Hepatocellular Carcinoma</b>

Primary liver cancer (PLC) is a common malignancy of the digestive system worldwide, among which about half of all new cases and deaths occur in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. The main pathological types of liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which accounts for 85 to 90 percent, and a small number of cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and HCC-ICC mixed liver cancer. In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, HCC is primarily caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

<b>About Sintilimab</b>

Sintilimab, marketed as TYVYT<sup>®</sup> (sintilimab injection) in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, is an innovative PD-1 inhibitor with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Eli Lilly and Company. Sintilimab is an immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1 / PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies of sintilimab to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials.

In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, sintilimab has been approved for three indications, including:
<ul>
 	<li>The treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy</li>
 	<li>In combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
 	<li>In combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
</ul>
Additionally, Innovent currently has regulatory submissions under review in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> for sintilimab:
<ul>
 	<li>In combination with BYVASDA<sup>®</sup> (bevacizumab injection) for the first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma</li>
 	<li>The second-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
</ul>
In <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2021</span>, the U.S. FDA accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Sintilimab was included in <span class=""xn-location"">China's</span> National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in 2019 as the first PD-1 inhibitor and the only PD-1 included in the list in that year.

<b>About BYVASDA<sup>®</sup> (bevacizumab biosimilar injection)</b>

BYVASDA<sup>®</sup>, also known as IBI305, is a bevacizumab biosimilar and a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important factor in angiogenesis that is highly expressed by the endothelial cells in most human tumors. An anti-VEGF antibody binds VEGF-A selectively with high affinity and blocks its binding to VEGF-2 receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt/PKB and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK. BYVASDA<sup>®</sup> produces anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the growth, proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, blocking angiogenesis, reducing vascular permeability, blocking blood supply to tumor tissues, inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Since its launch, bevacizumab has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in these tumor types have been well recognized worldwide.

BYVASDA<sup>®</sup> (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) was firstly approved by the China NMPA on <span class=""xn-chron"">June 17, 2020</span>. Approved indications of BYVASDA<sup>®</sup> include advanced non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. In <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2020</span>, it was also approved by the NMPA for the indication of adult recurrent glioblastoma.

<strong>Basel, June 22, 2021</strong> — Today, Novartis disclosed new data showing mean IgG and IgM levels remain unchanged in adults with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) treated with Kesimpta<sup>®</sup> (ofatumumab) over 3.5 years. The ongoing open label extension of the ALITHIOS study includes 1,703 people living with MS taking Kesimpta for up to 5 years. At the time of analysis, 456 of these people had reached 3.5 years of Kesimpta treatment duration. The long-term findings were consistent with the Phase III ASCLEPIOS trials data, which demonstrated that the overall incidence of infections was low, and no association was observed between decreased immunoglobulin levels and the risk of serious infections<sup>1</sup>. These data reinforce Kesimpta as a well-tolerated treatment option for people living with RMS.

“Evidence shows that low immunoglobulin levels have been linked to an increased risk of infection, which is why testing of these levels is recommended for people living with MS prior to taking any anti-CD20 treatment,” said Professor Heinz Wiendl, Director of the Clinic of Neurology at UKM Münste. “It’s encouraging to see that over a long period of time, IgG levels remained stable and IgM levels remained well within the reference ranges in all groups treated with ofatumumab, with no increased risk of infections.”

The results will be presented at the 7<sup>th</sup> Congress of the European Academy of Neurology – Virtual 2021, together with other wide-ranging data to further the understanding of how Kesimpta might impact immune response to a variety of standard vaccinations.

“Patient safety is of the utmost importance to Novartis and these long-term results continue to support Kesimpta as a high-efficacy, first-choice treatment with a favorable safety profile for people living with RMS,” said Marcia Kayath, Global Head Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Preservation of immunoglobulin levels is important to fight infections, like COVID-19, so we’re very happy to share long-term data showing Kesimpta had unchanged IgG levels, providing physicians with important information relevant to the long-term benefit/risk of treating with Kesimpta.”

<p align=""justify"">LEXINGTON, Mass. and AMSTERDAM, June 22, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- uniQure N.V. (NASDAQ: QURE), a leading gene therapy company advancing transformative therapies for patients with severe medical needs, today announced positive 52-week clinical data on all patients from its pivotal, Phase III HOPE-B gene therapy trial of etranacogene dezaparvovec, an investigational adeno-associated virus five (AAV5)-based gene therapy for the treatment of patients with severe and moderately severe hemophilia B. These are the first clinical data to be reported from a Phase III gene therapy study in hemophilia B and, with 54 patients, the largest set of hemophilia B patients receiving a single gene therapy investigational product to date.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Data from the HOPE-B pivotal study showed that participants continued to demonstrate durable, sustained increases in Factor IX (FIX) activity at 52-weeks post-infusion with a mean FIX activity of 41.5 percent of normal, as measured by a one-stage APTT-based clotting assay, compared to a mean FIX activity of 39.0 percent of normal at 26-weeks of follow-up. There continued to be no clinically significant correlation between pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV5 (NAbs) and FIX activity in patients with NAb titers up to 678.2, a range expected to include more than 93 percent of the general population.</p>
<p align=""justify"">During the 52-week period, a single dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec significantly reduced the annualized rate of bleeding requiring treatment by 80 percent from a prospectively collected 3.39 at baseline to 0.68 bleeding episodes per year (p-value &lt;0.0001). The annualized rate of spontaneous bleeding requiring treatment was also significantly reduced by 85 percent from a prospectively collected 1.16 at baseline to 0.18 bleeds per year during the 52-week period (p-value &lt;0.0001).</p>
<p align=""justify"">Usage of FIX replacement therapy (IU/year and infusions/year) in all patients declined 96 percent during the 52-week period, with 52 of 54 patients (96 percent) successfully discontinuing their prophylactic infusions. As previously announced, of the two non-responders, one patient only received a partial dose (less than 10 percent of the dosage) due to an infusion reaction and a second patient had an unusually high pre-existing NAb titer of 3,212, which is expected in less than 1 percent of the general population.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Etranacogene dezaparvovec continues to be generally well-tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events. No inhibitors to FIX have been reported and no consistent relationship between safety and pre-existing NAb titers has been observed.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We continue to be very encouraged by the data generated from the HOPE-B pivotal study of etranacogene dezaparvovec, which have been accepted for presentation at the annual International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis congress taking place next month,” stated Ricardo Dolmetch, Ph.D., president of research and development at uniQure. “The 52-week data show mean FIX activity in the normal range and increase our confidence in the potential durability and long-term benefits of etranacogene dezaparvovec, bringing us one step closer to our goal of delivering this groundbreaking therapy to fulfill an unmet medical need for patients living with hemophilia B.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Regulatory Update</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The Company and its partner, CSL Behring, have had recent communications with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including a pre-biologics licensing application (BLA) submission meeting held on June 4, 2021. The FDA confirmed that the primary evidence of durability of effect to inform regulatory decision-making will come from patients followed for at least a 52-week period beginning when etranacogene dezaparvovec-derived FIX levels have achieved steady state, rather than when etranacogene dezaparvovec is administered. This feedback was based upon review of statistical analysis plans, as no clinical data was provided or discussed. All patients in the HOPE-B pivotal study achieved steady-state FIX activity levels by 26-weeks after administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec. As a result, uniQure will now conduct as the sole primary endpoint a non-inferiority analysis of annualized bleeding rates (ABR) at 78 weeks after the administration (approximately 52-weeks after steady-state is achieved). The Company expects all patients to complete their 78-week follow-up visits by the end of the third quarter of 2021, and the Company and CSL Behring expect to submit the BLA in first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the HOPE-B Pivotal Clinical Trial</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The pivotal Phase III HOPE-B trial is a multinational, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Fifty-four adult hemophilia B patients classified as severe or moderately severe (defined as less than or equal to 2% of normal FIX activity) and requiring prophylactic FIX replacement therapy were enrolled in a prospective, six-month observational period during which time they continued to use their current standard of care therapy to establish a baseline ABR. After the six-month lead-in period, patients received a single intravenous administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec at the 2x1013 gc/kg dose. Patients were not excluded from the trial based on their pre-existing NAbs to AAV5. Forty-three percent of patients in the study had pre-existing NAbs to AAV5 up to a maximum observed pre-dosing titer of over 3,200.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Etranacogene Dezaparvovec</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Etranacogene dezaparvovec consists of an AAV5 viral vector carrying a gene cassette with the patent-protected Padua variant of Factor IX (FIX-Padua). Etranacogene dezaparvovec has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and access to Priority Medicine (PRIME) regulatory initiative by the European Medicines Agency. uniQure and CSL Behring entered into a commercialization and license agreement providing CSL Behring exclusive global commercialization rights to etranacogene dezaparvovec. The collaboration combines uniQure’s differentiated gene therapy candidate in hemophilia B and CSL Behring’s strong global reach and commercial infrastructure in hematology in an effort to accelerate access of etranacogene dezaparvovec to hemophilia B patients around the world.</p>
<p align=""justify"">AAV5-based gene therapies have been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in a multitude of clinical trials, including being well-tolerated to date in six uniQure trials conducted in nearly 90 patients in hemophilia B and other indications. No patient treated in clinical trials with the uniQure’s AAV5 gene therapies has experienced any confirmed cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response to the capsid. Additionally, pre-clinical and clinical data show that AAV5-based gene therapies may be viable treatments in patients with pre-existing antibodies to AAV5, thereby potentially increasing patient eligibility for treatment compared to other gene therapy product candidates.</p>

<p align=""justify"">LEXINGTON, Mass. and AMSTERDAM and PARIS, June 22, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- uniQure N.V. (NASDAQ: QURE), a leading gene therapy company advancing transformative therapies for patients with severe medical needs, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Corlieve Therapeutics and its lead program, which will be known as AMT-260, to treat temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common form of focal epilepsy.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Corlieve’s lead gene therapy program employs miRNA silencing technology to target suppression of aberrantly expressed kainate receptors in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). TLE affects approximately 1.3 million people in the U.S. and Europe alone, of which approximately 800,000 patients are unable to adequately control acute seizures with currently approved anti-epileptic therapies. Patients with refractory TLE experience increased morbidity, excess mortality, and poor quality of life.</p>
<p align=""justify"">AMT-260 was originally developed by Corlieve in collaboration with Christophe Mulle, Ph.D., CNRS Research Director, at the Interdisciplinary Institute of Neurosciences, CNRS, University of Bordeaux, Valerie Crepel, Ph.D., Inserm Research Director at the Institut de Neurobiologie de la Méditerranée, INSERM, Aix-Marseille University, and REGENXBIO Inc. Drs. Mulle and Crepel will continue their collaborations with uniQure.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The acquisition of Corlieve provides an extraordinary opportunity to transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients around the world suffering from epilepsy and aligns with our vision of pursuing unmet medical needs for disorders that impact large populations and can be addressed with gene therapies directed to the CNS and liver,” stated Matt Kapusta, Chief Executive Officer of uniQure. “The groundbreaking work of the Corlieve team, in collaboration with Drs. Mulle and Crepel, has led to compelling preclinical results in temporal lobe epilepsy that we believe can strategically leverage uniQure’s leading position in developing and delivering gene therapies that employ miRNA silencing technology. We look forward to welcoming the Corlieve team into the uniQure family as we join forces to advance this important and potentially transformative therapy into clinical studies.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“I am very proud of what Corlieve has achieved in such a short amount of time. With the dedication and focus of our team and our collaboration partners, we have taken a promising therapeutic approach discovered by our scientific founders and created a potential transformative therapeutic opportunity for patients with refractory TLE,” said Richard Porter, Ph.D., founder and Chief Executive Officer of Corlieve. “As leaders in the field for miRNA gene therapy for neurological conditions, uniQure is the ideal long-term partner for us, and we look forward to working together to advance our program rapidly to the clinic for the benefit of the patients we serve.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Upon the closing of the transaction, Dr. Porter will assume the role at uniQure of General Manager of the Corlieve subsidiary.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“As a founding investor, we are delighted to see that the translational work conducted by Corlieve is recognized by uniQure, further reinforcing our commitment to company creation based on partnering with the industry,” said Vanessa Malier, Managing Partner at Kurma Partners and Chairman of Corlieve.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Transaction Details</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the terms of the agreement, uniQure will pay €46.3 million in an upfront payment of cash to acquire Corlieve.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Corlieve shareholders are eligible to receive the following additional payments of which up to 25% will be payable in uniQure ordinary shares at uniQure’s election: up to €43.7 million in development milestones through Phase I/II and €160 million in milestones associated with Phase III development and the approvals of AMT-260 in the U.S and European Union.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Corlieve has an established license and collaboration agreement with REGENXBIO that includes an exclusive license to AAV9 for the specific genetic target of AMT-260. Under the license and collaboration agreement, REGENXBIO received equity in Corlieve and is eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on net sales of AMT-260.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The transaction has been approved by the Boards of both companies and does not require uniQure shareholder approval. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions as well as review by the French Ministry of Economy, Finance and Recovery (Ministère de l’Economie, des Finances et de la Relance) pursuant to articles L.151-3 and R.151-1 and seq. of the French Code Monétaire et Financier. Currently, the transaction is anticipated to be completed early in the third quarter of 2021.</p>

BOSTON &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pear Therapeutics, Inc. (“Pear”), the leader in developing and commercializing prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs) to treat serious disease, and Thimble Point Acquisition Corp. (“Thimble Point”) (Nasdaq: THMA), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) whose management team is associated with the Pritzker Vlock Family Office, today announced they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”).

Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, upon closing of the Business Combination, the combined company will be named Pear Holdings Corp. (the “Combined Company”) and will be led by Pear’s current management team. The Combined Company’s common stock is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the new ticker symbol “PEAR.”

“At Pear, we set out to transform healthcare through the use of PDTs, a new class of clinically validated, software-based therapeutics that we pioneered to improve patients’ outcomes across many therapeutic areas, alone and in combination with pharmaceuticals. With our end-to-end PDT platform, we are executing on our vision to redefine how patients, clinicians and payors can better navigate and benefit from a healthcare system so in need of disruption,” said Corey McCann, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “In our view Pear is at a commercial inflection point, with the potential for rapid expansion. We believe this transaction will allow us to drive widespread usage of PDTs to treat major medical conditions and overcome significant barriers to patient care.”

“As the category creator and leader in PDTs, Pear is at the forefront of revolutionizing healthcare. Pear’s impressive team of healthcare and technology leaders have built development, regulatory and commercial roadmaps for this new sector and have gained early market traction, creating a pathway to rapid scalability,” said Elon Boms, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Thimble Point Acquisition Corp. and Managing Director of PVFO. “Thimble Point sought to collaborate with a high-growth, tech-enabled company with the potential to disrupt large and established industries. We chose to invest in Pear because we believe it has the opportunity to become the primary commercial platform through which patients and prescribers access PDTs. Our growth capital comes at an inflection point for Pear, as the team works towards expected near-term value creation milestones.”

“We believe prescription digital therapeutics are creating a new category of medicine with applications worldwide,” said Kirthiga Reddy, Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. “As the lead investor of Pear’s last private financing round, we are pleased to support the company’s mission and their journey to becoming a publicly traded company.”

Pear, founded in 2013, is led by a management team that intends to leverage its biopharmaceutical, medtech, and technology expertise to create transformational products for patients and scale the delivery of them to global markets. Pear’s PDT engine enables the discovery, development and commercialization of PDTs at scale. Pear is one of nine companies invited to participate in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Precertification Pilot Program. Pear has developed and commercialized the first three FDA-authorized PDTs, has 14 product candidates, and is scaling its platform for third-party product distribution opportunities. The Company’s three FDA-authorized products, reSET®, reSET-O® and Somryst®, address large market opportunities with more than 20 million patients suffering from substance and opioid use disorders and more than 30 million from chronic insomnia, in the U.S. alone, respectively.

Like traditional medicines, PDTs are developed in a GMP-compliant environment, tested in randomized controlled trials demonstrating safety and efficacy, evaluated and authorized by regulators like the FDA, and used under the supervision of a prescribing clinician. Unlike traditional medicines, PDTs are software applications and are designed to collect real world data for use by prescribing clinicians and by payors and health systems for population health management.

<b>Summary of Business Combination</b>

The Business Combination values the Combined Company at a pro forma equity value of approximately $1.6 billion. Pursuant to the Business Combination, the Combined Company is expected to have approximately $450 million of net cash on its balance sheet upon the closing of the transaction. This includes approximately $400 million in gross proceeds from a combination of approximately $276 million in cash held in Thimble Point’s trust account, assuming no Thimble Point shareholders exercise their redemption rights at closing, and approximately $125 million, at $10.00 per share, from a fully committed PIPE with participation from leading healthcare and technology investors, including 5AM Ventures, Arboretum Ventures, Blue Water Science Advisors, LLC, dRx Capital (Novartis Pharma AG), The Eleven Fund, FORTH Management, Health Innovation Capital (HIC), JAZZ Venture Partners, a leading integrated delivery network, Neuberger Berman funds, Palantir, Pilot House, Pritzker Vlock Family Office, QUAD Investment Management, Sarissa Capital, Shanda Group, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Temasek, and Trustbridge Partners.

As a result of this broad support, the PIPE offering was oversubscribed, and it was upsized from $100 million to $125 million. All existing Pear equity holders will roll the entirety of their equity holdings into the Combined Company and are expected to hold approximately 72% of the issued and outstanding equity of the Combined Company immediately following the closing.

Net proceeds from the Business Combination will be used to further capitalize Pear’s category-leading position by investing in commercialization of Pear’s three FDA-authorized products, advancing Pear’s pipeline, and scaling its end-to-end platform.

The Combined Company’s board of directors will be initially comprised of seven directors, including four of Pear’s current directors plus one director designated by Thimble Point Acquisition Corp. Thimble Point’s designee is Jorge Gomez, the current CFO at Dentsply Sirona, the world’s largest manufacturer of professional dental products and technologies, and former CFO at Cardinal Health, one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals, a global manufacturer and distributor of medical and laboratory products, and a provider of performance and data solutions for healthcare facilities.

The Business Combination was unanimously approved by each of Thimble Point’s Board of Directors and Pear’s Board of Directors, and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021. The Business Combination will be subject to approval by Thimble Point’s shareholders and satisfaction or the waiver of the closing conditions identified in the Business Combination Agreement.

SAN DIEGO, June 22, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, ""Sorrento"") today announced a broad multi-year Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with NAMRU-3. Under the terms of the agreement, NAMRU-3 will conduct surveillance and clinical validation research, and Sorrento will provide technical expertise and access to its portfolio of products to combat the SARS-CoV-2 and threats emerging due to variants of concern.

The mission of NAMRU-3 is to ensure warfighter readiness through detecting, deterring, and responding to infectious disease threats through integration with partners throughout U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), Central Command (CENTCOM), and European Command (EUCOM) areas of responsibility. The purpose of this collaboration is to perform infectious disease research that guides the Department of Defense (DoD), informs public health policy of host nation partners, and improves medical readiness of the U.S. Armed Forces across NAMRU-3 areas of responsibility. Through shared resources and logistical support, the overall goal of this research cooperation will be to conduct research on current, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, to enhance Force Health Protection, and provide critical data regarding countermeasures to mitigate infectious disease transmission including surveillance and product development.

The initial focus of the collaboration will be to improve infectious disease readiness through surveillance and clinical diagnostic validation activities for COVISTIX/COVITRACK Diagnostics and COVIDROPS/COVI-AMG outpatient neutralizing antibody treatment. “We are enthusiastic about this opportunity to collaborate with NAMRU-3 to rapidly and efficiently evaluate and deploy our products in parts of the world where more effective solutions are desperately needed.” – Dr. Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics.

From the start of this pandemic, Sorrento Therapeutics’ focus has been to leverage its proprietary G-MAB antibody library and to develop best in category solutions to combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants of concern. These include highly sensitive, simple, and low-cost diagnostics (COVISTIX, COVITRACK), potent neutralizing antibodies (COVI-AMG and COVIDROPS, which are undergoing clinical trials in the outpatient setting) and rescue therapies (Abivertinib and COVI-MSC, which are undergoing clinical trials for hospitalized and severely ill patients) for COVID-19.

Basel, 24 June 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA), under Priority Review, for Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS) for the treatment of neovascular or “wet” age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Neovascular AMD is a leading cause of blindness for people aged 60 and over and impacts approximately 20 million people worldwide.<sup>1,2,3</sup> If approved, PDS would be a first-of-its-kind therapeutic approach, offering people living with nAMD an alternative to frequent eye injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the current standard of care.<sup>4</sup> The FDA is expected to make a decision on approval by 23 October 2021.

“Anti-VEGF therapy brings significant benefit to people with nAMD, but optimal results require frequent trips to the doctor’s office for eye injections. This burden leaves many people under-treated and susceptible to vision loss,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “If approved, PDS would transform nAMD treatment by providing up to six months of uninterrupted therapy that could potentially improve vision outcomes compared to what is currently achieved in the clinic.”

PDS is a permanent refillable eye implant, approximately the size of a grain of rice, designed to continuously deliver a customised formulation of ranibizumab over a period of months, potentially reducing the treatment burden associated with frequent eye injections.<sup>4</sup><sup>,5</sup>

The BLA submission is based on positive results from the phase III Archway study primary analysis, which showed that of those nAMD patients being treated with PDS, more than 98% were able to go six months without needing additional treatment prior to the refill-exchange. In addition, these patients achieved vision outcomes equivalent to patients receiving monthly ranibizumab eye injections. In the study, PDS was generally well-tolerated, with a favourable benefit-risk profile. The safety profile of PDS in the clinical trial setting is well understood and will continue to be closely monitored. If approved, PDS would be the first and only nAMD therapy indicated to allow six months between treatments.<sup>4</sup><sup>,6</sup>

Roche has a robust phase III clinical development programme underway for PDS, including the Portal, Pagoda and Pavilion studies. Portal is an extension study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of PDS in nAMD.<sup>7</sup> Pagoda is evaluating PDS for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME),<sup>8</sup> while Pavilion is a study of PDS in diabetic retinopathy without DME.<sup>9 </sup>Both the Pagoda and Pavilion trials are actively recruiting participants.<sup>8,9</sup>

The PDS Marketing Authorisation Application has also been validated by the European Medicines Agency and is currently under review.

Patients enrolled in Archway were responders to prior treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. In both study arms, patients were treated with at least three anti-VEGF injections within the six months prior to their Archway screening visit. The primary endpoint of the study is the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score (the best distance vision a person can achieve – including with correction such as glasses – when reading letters on an eye chart) from baseline at the average of Week 36 and Week 40. Secondary endpoints include safety, overall change in BCVA from baseline and change from baseline in center point thickness over time.

According to pre-specified study criteria, PDS was shown to be non-inferior and equivalent to monthly ranibizumab injections. On average, patients had received five prior ranibizumab injections before their first Archway visit. In the PDS arm of the study, patients gained an average of 0.2 eye chart letters in visual acuity from baseline compared with 0.5 eye chart letters for the monthly ranibizumab arm. During the first treatment interval, before the first scheduled refill, 1.6% of PDS patients assessed (n=4/246) received supplemental treatment, and 98.4% of patients (n=242/246) did not receive supplemental treatment.

In addition, PDS controlled retinal thickness as effectively as monthly ranibizumab, with patients in both arms achieving a mean change in center point thickness within 10 µm from baseline at Week 36. In the study, PDS was generally well-tolerated, with a favourable benefit-risk profile. The safety profile of PDS in the clinical trial setting is well understood and will continue to be closely monitored.

<strong>About </strong><strong>neovascular</strong><strong> age-related macular degeneration</strong>
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for activities like reading.<sup>2</sup> Neovascular or “wet” AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease that can cause rapid and severe vision loss.<sup>11,12 </sup>It develops when new and abnormal blood vessels grow uncontrolled under the macula, causing swelling, bleeding and/or fibrosis.<sup>12</sup> Worldwide, around 20 million people are living with nAMD – the leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 60 – and the condition will affect even more people around the world as the global population ages.<sup>1,2,3</sup>

<strong>About Port Delivery System with </strong><strong>ranibizumab</strong><strong> (PDS)</strong>
PDS is a permanent refillable eye implant, approximately the size of a grain of rice, which is designed to continuously release a customised formulation of ranibizumab into the eye over time.<sup>4</sup> Ranibizumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to bind to and inhibit VEGF-A, a protein that is believed to play a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels and the leakiness of the vessels.<sup>13</sup> PDS contains a customised formulation of ranibizumab not approved by regulatory authorities. It is different from the ranibizumab intravitreal injection, a medicine marketed as Lucentis® (ranibizumab injection), which is approved to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and other retinal diseases.<sup>14</sup>

By maintaining therapeutic drug concentration levels of ranibizumab with two refills per year, PDS may offer greater outcomes certainty in terms of vision gains and maintaining those gains for people living with retinal diseases, including nAMD.<sup>6</sup> Additionally, by decreasing the need for frequent injections and physician visits, PDS may reduce the burden of treatment associated with standard anti-VEGF treatments.<sup>4,5</sup>

<strong>About Roche in Ophthalmology</strong>
Roche is focused on saving people’s eyesight from the leading causes of vision loss through pioneering therapies. Through our innovation in the scientific discovery of new potential drug targets, personalised healthcare, molecular engineering, biomarkers and continuous drug delivery, we strive to design the right therapies for the right patients.

We have the broadest retina pipeline in Ophthalmology, covering early and late stage products, which is led by science and informed by insights from people with eye diseases. Our late stage pipeline includes two potential first-of-a-kind treatments, Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS) and faricimab, which are being evaluated in a number of retinal conditions including neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy. PDS is an investigational, permanent refillable eye implant that continuously delivers a customised formulation of ranibizumab over a period of months, potentially reducing the treatment burden associated with frequent eye injections. Faricimab is the first investigational bispecific antibody designed for the eye. It targets two distinct pathways – via angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) – that drive a number of retinal conditions, to stabilise blood vessels, potentially improving vision outcomes for longer. Our early stage pipeline includes gene therapies and treatments for geographic atrophy and other vision-threatening diseases, including rare and inherited conditions.

Applying our extensive experience, we have already brought breakthrough ophthalmic treatments to people living with vision loss through Lucentis®?* (ranibizumab injection), the first treatment approved to improve vision in people with certain retinal conditions.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass, – Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Michel Vounatsos, “Biogen”) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for lecanemab (BAN2401), an investigational anti-amyloid beta (Aß) protofibril antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Breakthrough Therapy designation is an FDA program intended to expedite the development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening conditions. The benefits of a Breakthrough Therapy designation include more intensive guidance on an efficient development program as well as eligibility for rolling review and potentially priority review.

The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation for lecanemab is based on the recently published results of a Phase 2b clinical trial (Study 201) of 856 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD with confirmed presence of amyloid pathology.1 The proof-of-concept Study 201 explored the impact of treatment with lecanemab on reducing brain amyloid beta (Aß) and clinical decline. In this study, pre-specified analysis showed consistent reduction of clinical decline across several clinical and biomarker endpoints at the highest doses.
In March 2021 Eisai and Biogen completed enrollment of 1,795 patients with early AD in the Clarity AD study. The study’s primary endpoint is expected to be completed by the end of September 2022. Additionally, the Phase 3 clinical study, AHEAD 3-45, is currently exploring lecanemab in individuals with preclinical AD, meaning they are clinically normal and have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brains. Open label extension data from Study 201 confirmed time-dependent reduction of brain Aß in individuals newly treated with lecanemab and was presented at the 2021 Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease Conference.

[Notes to editors]

About Lecanemab (BAN2401)
Lecanemab is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that is the result of a strategic research alliance between Eisai and BioArctic. Lecanemab selectively binds to neutralize and eliminate soluble, toxic amyloid-beta (Aß) aggregates (protofibril) that are thought to contribute to the neurodegenerative process in AD. As such, lecanemab may have the potential to have an effect on disease pathology and to slow down the progression of the disease. Eisai obtained the global rights to study, develop, manufacture and market lecanemab for the treatment of AD pursuant to an agreement concluded with BioArctic in December 2007. In March 2014 Eisai and Biogen entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement for lecanemab and the parties amended that agreement in October 2017. Currently, lecanemab is being studied in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study in symptomatic early AD (Clarity-AD), following the outcome of the Phase 2 clinical study (Study 201). In July 2020 the Phase 3 clinical study (AHEAD 3-45) for individuals with preclinical AD, meaning they are clinically normal and have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brains, was initiated. AHEAD 3-45 is conducted as a public-private partnership between the Alzheimer’s Clinical Trial Consortium, funded by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, and Eisai.

About the Collaboration between Eisai and Biogen for Alzheimer’s Disease
Eisai and Biogen are collaborating on the joint development and commercialization of AD treatments. Eisai serves as the lead in the co-development of lecanemab.

About the Collaboration between Eisai and BioArctic for Alzheimer’s Disease
Since 2005, BioArctic has had a long-term collaboration with Eisai regarding the development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of AD. The commercialization agreement on the lecanemab antibody was signed in December 2007, and the development and commercialization agreement on the antibody lecanemab back-up for AD, which was signed in May 2015. Eisai is responsible for the clinical development, application for market approval and commercialization of the products for AD. BioArctic has no development costs for lecanemab in AD.

<b>Berlin, Germany, June 23, 2021 </b>– Bayer announced today that the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan has approved soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator vericiguat under the brand name Verquvo™. Verquvo (vericiguat) 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg is approved for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure who are receiving standard treatment for chronic heart failure. The approval is based on the results of the pivotal Phase III VICTORIA trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in March 2020.

“Heart failure is a life-altering disease which affects approximately 1.2 million people in Japan, a number that continues to rise. It has a serious impact on the lives of patients, their families and loved ones,” said Dr. Michael Devoy, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Medical Affairs and Pharmacovigilance at Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals Division. “Bayer is proud of the approval of vericiguat in Japan and the contribution it has shown in clinical trials.”

Vericiguat is the first sGC stimulator to be approved for the treatment of chronic heart failure. It was studied specifically in patients who have experienced a recent worsening heart failure event, meaning a recent hospitalization for heart failure or the use of intravenous diuretics, in order to reduce the risk of further worsening events. Verquvo (vericiguat) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2021 and was recommended for marketing authorization by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in the EU in May 2021. Additionally, it has been submitted for marketing authorization in China, as well as multiple other countries worldwide.

Vericiguat is being jointly developed with MSD (a tradename of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA).

<b>About Vericiguat</b>
Vericiguat 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg is an oral once daily stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an important enzyme in the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger that plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone, cardiac contractility, and cardiac remodeling. Heart failure is associated with impaired synthesis of NO and decreased activity of sGC, which may contribute to myocardial and vascular dysfunction. By directly stimulating sGC, independently of and synergistically with NO, vericiguat augments levels of intracellular cGMP, which counteracts the impaired function of the heart and blood vessels.

<b>About the Worldwide Collaboration between Bayer and MSD</b>
Since October 2014, Bayer and MSD (known as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in the U.S. and Canada) have pursued a worldwide collaboration in the field of sGC modulators. The collaboration brings together two leading companies that have stated their intent to fully evaluate this therapeutic class in areas of unmet medical need. The vericiguat program is being co-developed by Bayer and MSD. MSD has the commercial rights to vericiguat in the U.S. and Bayer has the exclusive commercial rights in the rest of world. The companies share equally the costs of the development of vericiguat.

Evrysdi is designed to treat SMA by increasing and sustaining the production of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement. Evrysdi was approved in the U.S. in August 2020 and in Europe in March 2021. About spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disease that causes muscule atrophy and muscle weakness due to degeneration of the motor neuron.1) It is the most frequently observed lifethreatening genetic disease in infants.2) The incidence of SMA from infancy to childhood is one to two in 100,000 individuals.3) The causative gene for SMA is the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. The disease develops because of insufficient production of functional SMN protein from SMN2 genes alone, in addition to the dysfunction of the SMN1 gene.4) Sources 1) Farrar MA and Kiernan MC.

<b>RARITAN, NJ,</b> <b>June 23, 2021 </b>– The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced today it has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of XARELTO<sup>®</sup> (rivaroxaban) in pediatric patients. The NDA seeks two pediatric indications: treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE, or blood clots) and reduction in the risk of recurrent VTE in patients aged birth to less than 18 years of age after at least five days of initial parenteral anticoagulant treatment; and thromboprophylaxis (prevention of blood clots) in patients aged 2 years and older with congenital heart disease who have undergone the Fontan procedure. If approved, XARELTO<sup>®</sup> will be the first and only oral Factor Xa inhibitor indicated in the U.S. for use in pediatric patients.

<b>CLICK TO TWEET</b><b>:</b> @JanssenUS announces NDA submission to @US_FDA for two new potential pediatric indications for the treatment and prevention of #bloodclots. Learn more: https://ctt.ac/dS3qz+

Current guidelines are limited and recommend treating pediatric patients with or at risk for reoccurring blood clots with standard anticoagulant therapy, which often requires painful injections, dietary restrictions and regular laboratory monitoring. There are currently no FDA-approved anticoagulation therapies for pediatric patients with congenital heart disease who have undergone the Fontan procedure, a surgical procedure that redirects blood flow from the lower body to the lungs. The limited guidance for managing these patients leaves physicians to extrapolate adult data to infer pediatric dosing and then regularly monitor their patients.

“The filing of this application is an important step in helping to address the burden of blood clots and provide doctors with optimal body weight-based dosing options in pediatric patients,” said James List, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular &amp; Metabolism, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. “Today’s announcement is the culmination of years of commitment to understanding the safety and efficacy profile of XARELTO<sup>®</sup> in patients of all ages.”

The application is based on evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of XARELTO<sup>®</sup> in adults as well as data from two Phase 3 clinical trials of XARELTO<sup>®</sup> in pediatric populations: <a class=""Link "" href=""https://www.jnj.com/xarelto-rivaroxaban-helps-protect-pediatric-patients-from-blood-clots-in-late-breaking-phase-3-einstein-jr-study"" aria-label=""EINSTEIN-Jr"" data-cms-ai=""0"">EINSTEIN-Jr</a>, which examined pediatric patients with previously diagnosed VTE, and UNIVERSE, which evaluated pediatric patients who are at risk of VTE after recently undergoing the Fontan procedure.

Part of the industry leading EXPLORER clinical research program, EINSTEIN-Jr is the largest study completed to date evaluating the treatment of pediatric patients with VTE, and UNIVERSE is the first clinical trial to examine a DOAC for the prevention of thromboembolism in congenital heart disease post-Fontan pediatric patients.

For both potential indications, XARELTO<sup>®</sup> would be dosed based on body weight, either with an oral suspension formulation or tablets. The oral suspension formulation would be administered through a unique color-coded dosing device that was designed to help minimize dosing errors.

Earlier this year, Janssen’s development partner Bayer received approval in Canada, the EU including the UK, Japan and Switzerland for XARELTO<sup>®</sup> for the treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years after at least 5 days of initial parenteral anticoagulation treatment.

<b>About EINSTEIN-Jr</b>
<a class=""Link "" href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhae/article/PIIS2352-3026(19)30219-4/fulltext"" aria-label=""EINSTEIN-Jr"" data-cms-ai=""0"">EINSTEIN-Jr</a> is a randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, open-label Phase 3 study that evaluated the use of XARELTO<sup>®</sup> in 500 children, aged birth to 17 years, with previously diagnosed acute VTE who had started parenteral anticoagulation therapy. Participants were enrolled from November 2014 to September 2018, from 107 sites in 28 countries, and were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either an open-label, body weight-adjusted dose of XARELTO<sup>®</sup> (tablets or new oral suspension) (n=335) to approximate a 20 mg adult dose or standard anticoagulation therapy (n=165). EINSTEIN-Jr is the largest pediatric study completed to date for the treatment of VTE. It is part of the comprehensive EINSTEIN program, which also included four pivotal Phase 3 studies in adult populations: EINSTEIN-DVT, EINSTEIN-PE, EINSTEIN-EXT and EINSTEIN CHOICE.

<b>About UNIVERSE</b>
UNIVERSE is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active controlled, two-part, Phase 3 study that examined the use of a novel, oral suspension XARELTO<sup>® </sup>formulation in children 2-8 years old with single ventricle physiology who had the Fontan procedure within four months before enrollment. From November 2016 to June 2019, a total of 112 participants were enrolled across 36 sites in 10 countries.
UNIVERSE was conducted in two parts. Part A evaluated the single- and multiple-dose PK and PD properties of XARELTO<sup>® </sup>while Part B evaluated the comparative safety and efficacy of XARELTO<sup>®</sup> versus aspirin when used for thromboprophylaxis for 12 months.

<b>About EXPLORER</b>
The EXPLORER clinical research program is unmatched by any oral anticoagulant in the Factor Xa inhibitor class in its size, scope and ambition. A collaborative effort between Janssen and Bayer, EXPLORER seeks to generate important clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of XARELTO<sup>®</sup> and its potential role in addressing critical unmet medical needs. By the time of its completion, more than 275,000 patients will have participated in the EXPLORER clinical development program, other completed and ongoing clinical trials, investigative registries, and non-interventional studies. Since its inception, the program has built upon extensive evidence reinforcing the benefits of XARELTO<sup>®</sup> for the millions of patients to whom it has been prescribed since its launch in 2011.

WHAT IS XARELTO<sup>®</sup> (rivaroxaban)?
XARELTO<sup>®</sup> is a prescription medicine used to:
<ul>
 	<li>reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people who have a medical condition called atrial fibrillation that is not caused by a heart valve problem. With atrial fibrillation, part of the heart does not beat the way it should. This can lead to the formation of blood clots, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body</li>
 	<li>treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE)</li>
 	<li>reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months</li>
 	<li>help prevent a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had hip or knee replacement surgery</li>
 	<li>help prevent blood clots in certain people hospitalized for an acute illness and after discharge, who are at risk of getting blood clots because of the loss of or decreased ability to move around (mobility) and other risks for getting blood clots, and who do not have a high risk of bleeding</li>
</ul>
XARELTO<sup>®</sup> is used with low dose aspirin to:
<ul>
 	<li>reduce the risk of serious heart problems, heart attack and stroke in people with coronary artery disease (a condition where the blood supply to the heart is reduced or blocked) or peripheral artery disease (a condition where the blood flow to the legs is reduced)</li>
</ul>
It is not known if XARELTO<sup>®</sup> is safe and effective in children.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>
<b>WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT XARELTO<sup>®</sup>?</b>

<b>XARELTO<sup>®</sup> may cause serious side effects, including:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Increased risk of blood clots if you stop taking XARELTO<sup>®</sup>.</b> People with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) that is not caused by a heart valve problem (nonvalvular) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO<sup>®</sup> lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO<sup>®</sup>, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.</li>
</ul>
<b>Do not stop taking XARELTO<sup>®</sup> without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO<sup>®</sup> increases your risk of having a stroke. </b>If you have to stop taking XARELTO<sup>®</sup>, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.
<ul>
 	<li><b>Increased risk of bleeding. </b>XARELTO<sup>®</sup> can cause bleeding which can be serious, and may lead to death. This is because XARELTO<sup>®</sup> is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that lowers blood clotting. During treatment with XARELTO<sup>®</sup> you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. You may be at higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO<sup>®</sup> and have certain other medical problems.</li>
</ul>
<b>You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO<sup>®</sup> and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Aspirin or aspirin-containing products</li>
 	<li>Long-term (chronic) use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</li>
 	<li>Warfarin sodium (Coumadin<sup>®</sup>, Jantoven<sup>®</sup>)</li>
 	<li>Any medicine that contains heparin</li>
 	<li>Clopidogrel (Plavix<sup>®</sup>)</li>
 	<li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</li>
 	<li>Other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots</li>
</ul>
Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.

<b>Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Unexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:
<ul>

<strong>Männedorf, </strong><strong>Switzerland, </strong><strong>June </strong><strong>23</strong><strong> 20</strong><strong>21</strong> – The Tecan Group (SIX Swiss Exchange: TECN) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire US-based Paramit Corporation and its affiliates (“Paramit”) for a total purchase consideration of USD 1.0 billion (CHF 920 million). Paramit, headquartered in Morgan Hill (CA), US, is a leading OEM developer and manufacturer of medical devices and life sciences instruments. With the addition of approximately USD 300 million in revenues (CHF 276 million) expected in 2022, the acquisition will further extend Tecan’s position in solutions for life sciences and in-vitro diagnostics (IVD). It will also add a new business vertical in the attractive and fast-growing market for medical devices. The acquisition will bring significant engineering as well as cost-competitive manufacturing capabilities, both in North America and in the APAC region. Equipped with proprietary computer-directed assembly technology, these facilities deliver ultra-flexible production planning, while reducing the potential for errors (“zero-defect manufacturing”).

Tecan CEO, Dr. Achim von Leoprechting, commented: “We are delighted to bring the Paramit Team into the Tecan Group. The company’s extensive OEM offering and its state-of-the-art development and manufacturing facilities will strengthen our market reach and enable us to more effectively meet customer needs, scaling innovation from research all the way to the clinic. In addition to extending our core markets of life science research and diagnostics, the acquisition will also open a whole new growth market in the field of medical devices. At Tecan, we share Paramit’s strong customer-centric culture, expertise and track record in quality and regulatory affairs, which are key differentiators in the industry and essential for OEM success in regulated markets. Paramit’s geographic presence is complementary to that of Tecan, benefitting both parties. Tecan will gain new highly efficient manufacturing capacity in Asia and a strong presence for its OEM business in North America. At the same time, Paramit will gain access to Tecan’s existing sales channels in other parts of the world. These opportunities will help us to broaden our customer base and offering, while further strengthening our ability to serve the healthcare market.”

<strong>Paramit – u</strong><strong>nique combination of design engineering</strong><strong> with a </strong><strong>proprietary assembly concept</strong>
Established in 1990, Paramit is headquartered in Silicon Valley in the United States. It has facilities in Morgan Hill (CA) and in Penang, Malaysia. Paramit’s recently acquired R&amp;D facility in Boston (MA) specializes in technology development and the design of complex products and systems for multiple sectors, complementing Tecan’s existing R&amp;D capabilities. Across these different sites, the company employs over 1’000 associates. Since 2011, Paramit Corporation has been privately held by Altaris Capital Partners, LLC, a healthcare-dedicated investment firm based in New York (NY).

Paramit has developed and/or manufactured several FDA-approved medical devices, including surgical instruments, critical modules and systems for surgical robotics, point-of-care and personal testing devices, as well as diagnostic systems.

Paramit also works with life science companies developing and manufacturing high-precision instrumentation. Its clients are mainly US-based companies commercializing a range of products for genomics, proteomics and cell-analysis including flow cytometers, microfluidic instruments, and systems for electrophoresis, imaging, high-sensitivity biomarker detection, microarrays and sample preparation.

Paramit’s patented, computer-directed assembly technology, vPoke<sup>®</sup>, resolves complex mechanical assembly into tightly controlled assembly steps for medical device and life science instruments. The process generates a rich device history record, providing component traceability, while reducing the potential for errors (“zero-defect manufacturing”).

Billoo Rataul, President and CEO of Paramit said: “It has been an incredible journey establishing Paramit as a global leader in the life sciences and medical device industries alongside Altaris. We are incredibly proud of the organization we have built together and look forward to our future with Tecan. Combining Paramit’s leading design and manufacturing expertise with Tecan’s strengths is the next logical step for our growing business. Becoming part of the Tecan Group will take our industry-leading offering to new customers in expanding markets. It will enable us to further develop our expertise in life sciences and clinical diagnostics and address an extended range of scientific applications. Tecan’s commitment to our strategic position in medical devices will boost our growth in that sector. Our customers stand to gain from the combined supply chain depth and Tecan’s broad expertise in design and manufacturing of solutions for highly regulated environments. We passionately share Tecan’s customer-focused culture and its mission to contribute to the quality of life of humankind. We are therefore excited to begin this new chapter in the development of our organization.”

<strong>Strengthens Tecan’s </strong><strong>OEM offering</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> expan</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>ing</strong><strong> into attractive medical device market</strong>
The acquisition of Paramit will strengthen Tecan’s OEM offering in solutions for the life sciences and IVD markets. It will also significantly expand the total addressable market for Tecan’s Partnering Business. It will broaden access to the custom design and manufacturing segment and enable the business to expand into the fast-growing market of medical devices. Although this is a new business vertical for Tecan, it leverages the company’s existing core competencies. Paramit will bring state-of-the-art, high-quality, cost-competitive manufacturing services, together with a proven, highly scalable, proprietary approach to complex assembly (vPoke<sup>®</sup>) and an established track record in scaling innovation for partners in regulated markets. Paramit will also substantially expand Tecan’s production engineering and industrialization capabilities.

Paramit’s R&amp;D presence in the technology hubs of Silicon Valley and Boston will help drive the expansion of the combined customer base and Tecan’s engineering capabilities in the US, the world’s largest market for the life sciences and healthcare.

<strong>Significantly enhances value proposition for combined customer base</strong>
The combined entity will have an industry-leading OEM offering, including extensive experience in quality and regulatory affairs, and a well-diversified, differentiated and fully complementary portfolio of products and services. The transaction will strengthen the combined entity’s design, development and manufacturing capabilities, and enable it to further improve its services. Thereby, it will provide a more comprehensive value proposition for customers in the healthcare industry.

While Tecan already has significant relationships with key players in fast-growing segments of the healthcare industry, Paramit brings with it a number of significant accounts and a strong presence in North America. Likewise, Paramit will be able to leverage Tecan’s existing OEM customer base and its commercial channel to further expand its reach in the European and Asian markets, including China, and beyond.

<strong>Compelling financial benefits</strong>
The acquisition will be immediately accretive to earnings per share (EPS) upon closing. With strong growth and healthy operating margins recorded over the past five years, Paramit is expected to generate around USD 280 million in sales (CHF 257 million) and approximately USD 50 million EBITDA (CHF 46 million) in the full year 2021 (before acquisition-related costs). This transformation of Tecan into a &gt;CHF 1 billion revenue and &gt;CHF 200 million EBITDA company will provide the Group with critical mass and scale, further enhancing its already strong operating cash flows. This strengthened financial profile will fuel future growth, both organic and through additional acquisitions.

Tecan anticipates substantial commercial and cost synergies to be achieved through a range of opportunities, including synergies in the supply chain and the internalization of supplies of certain parts, modules and sub-assemblies.

<strong>Financing of the transaction</strong>
Upon closing of the transaction, the total purchase consideration of USD 1.0 billion (CHF 920 million) will be funded through a mix of cash on hand (net liquidity of Tecan as of December 31, 2020: CHF 467.7 million), the issuance of new shares and a bond offering. Tecan has obtained committed bridge financing with respect to the purchase price from Credit Suisse.
Tecan’s debt leverage after the transaction is expected to be at around 1.0x net debt/EBITDA and is expected to decrease quickly, driven by cash generation of the combined entity.
For the equity portion of the financing, Tecan intends to issue new shares from existing authorized share capital corresponding to less than 10% of its share capital.

The transaction, which is expected to be completed in the coming months, is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Upon completion, Paramit will be included in the consolidated financial statements of the Tecan Group as part of the Partnering Business segment.

<span class=""xn-location"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">NEWARK, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 24, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Teneobio, Inc. announced today that AbbVie exercised its exclusive right to acquire TeneoOne, an affiliate of Teneobio, Inc., and TNB-383B, a BCMA-targeting immunotherapeutic for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM). In <span class=""xn-chron"">February 2019</span>, AbbVie and TeneoOne entered a strategic transaction to develop and commercialize TNB-383B, a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets BCMA and CD3 and is designed to direct the body's own immune system to target and kill BCMA-expressing tumor cells. AbbVie exercised its exclusive right to acquire TeneoOne and TNB-383B based on an interim analysis of an ongoing Phase 1 study.

Interim results from the ongoing Phase 1 study demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 79 percent, very good partial response (VGPR) or better of 63 percent, and complete response (CR) of 29 percent at doses =40 mg in the dose escalation cohorts with a median follow-up time of 6.1 months (n=24). The median duration of response (DOR) has not been reached.

""Since the beginning of this partnership, we have been encouraged by the potential of TNB-383B as a promising new therapy for multiple myeloma, and our analysis of the Phase 1 data to date has allowed us to make this decision with confidence,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Michael Severino</span>, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. ""While other BCMA and CD3 bispecific therapies require weekly administration, the recommended Phase 2 dose of TNB-383B will investigate infrequent dosing of every 3 weeks for intravenous administration, which is an important treatment factor for people living with multiple myeloma.""

In this interim analysis, the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events observed across all grades were cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (52 percent), fatigue (25 percent), and neutropenia (24 percent). At the recommended Phase 2 dose of 60 mg administered intravenously every three weeks (Q3W), the CRS rate was 67 percent (all grades) with a grade =3 CRS rate of 3 percent (1/39 subjects). No CRS of grade 4 or higher was observed. Onset of CRS generally occurred on the same or next day following the first dose.

""Our aim in developing TNB-383B and our T-cell redirecting anti-CD3 platform is to maximize the therapeutic window of a class of therapeutic molecules that have been clinically challenged by dose-limiting toxicities,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Roland Buelow</span>, CEO of Teneobio, Inc. ""AbbVie recognized the potential of Teneobio's platform and shared our vision to assess its clinical validation. The clinical data support the unique features of TNB-383B and our T-cell redirecting CD3 platform. We are confident that AbbVie is the right partner to rapidly develop TNB-383B with the ultimate goal to bring this potential new therapy to myeloma patients in need.""

This first-in-human, ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation and expansion study evaluates the safety, clinical pharmacology, and clinical activity of TNB-383B in patients with R/R MM who have received at least three prior lines of therapy. The study consists of two portions, a monotherapy dose escalation arm and a monotherapy dose expansion arm. At the interim analysis, 103 subjects have been treated with TNB-383B.

The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance by the U.S. antitrust authorities under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","INDIANAPOLIS, June 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for donanemab, Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) investigational antibody therapy for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The Breakthrough Therapy designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over already available therapies that have received full FDA approval.

The FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on clinical evidence for donanemab, an investigational antibody that targets a modified form of beta amyloid called N3pG. The company’s Phase 2 trial, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, studied the efficacy and safety of donanemab in patients with early, symptomatic AD. These data were presented at the 15th International Conference on Alzheimer’s & Parkinson Diseases™ 2021 (AD/PD™ 2021) and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Lilly intends to submit a biologics license application (BLA) for donanemab under the accelerated approval pathway later this year based on data from TRAILBLAZER-ALZ. The safety, tolerability and efficacy of donanemab are also being evaluated in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center Phase 3 study TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (NCT04437511).

About TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Study
TRAILBLAZER-ALZ (NCT03367403) is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center Phase 2 study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of donanemab in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. The trial enrolled 272 patients who were selected based on cognitive assessments in conjunction with amyloid plaque imaging and tau staging by PET imaging. The study’s primary endpoint was change from baseline until 76 weeks in the Integrated Alzheimer’s Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), a composite tool combining the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog13) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-iADL) for function. Key secondary endpoints included changes between baseline and 76 weeks in the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), ADCS-iADL, MMSE, and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Other secondary biomarker endpoints included changes from baseline to week 76 in brain amyloid deposition and brain tau deposition and volumetric MRI.

 

About Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory and other aspects of cognition. Dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of all cases1. There are currently over 50 million people living with dementia around the world, with numbers expected to increase to nearly 152 million by 20502. Almost 10 million new cases of dementia are diagnosed each year worldwide, implying one new case every 3 seconds, and a significant increase in the caregiving burden placed on society and families. In the US alone, there was an increase of 8 million new caregivers from 2015 to 20203. The current annual societal and economic cost of dementia is estimated at $1 trillion, an amount that is expected to double by 2030 unless we find a way to slow the disease2.

<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 25, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of RINVOQ<sup>®</sup> (upadacitinib), an oral, selective and reversible JAK inhibitor, for the expanded use in adults (15 mg or 30 mg, once daily) and adolescents 12 years and older (15 mg, once daily) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy. RINVOQ is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.<sup class=""last-child"">4-10</sup>

The CHMP positive opinion was supported by data from the global Phase 3 program evaluating more than 2,500 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis across three global pivotal studies: Measure Up 1, Measure Up 2 and AD Up.<sup class=""first-child"">1,2</sup> Across the three studies, both doses of RINVOQ met all primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating rapid and significant improvement in skin clearance and reduction in itch compared to placebo at week 16 and other time points (p&lt;0.001) in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.<sup>1,2</sup> The most commonly reported adverse events in patients treated with RINVOQ were acne, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections.<sup class=""last-child"">1,2</sup>

""This milestone is an important step forward in our journey to improve care for people living with atopic dermatitis,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Michael Severino</span>, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. ""Despite available treatments, many people with moderate to severe forms of this disease continue to experience a relentless and burdensome cycle of skin and itch symptoms. We are encouraged that the CHMP has recognized RINVOQ's potential as an additional treatment option for these patients.""

The CHMP positive opinion is a scientific recommendation for marketing authorization to the European Commission, which authorizes marketing approval in the European Union. The Marketing Authorization will be valid in all member states of the European Union, as well as <span class=""xn-location first-child"">Iceland</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Liechtenstein</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Norway</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Northern Ireland</span>. If approved, this will be the fourth indication for RINVOQ, and RINVOQ will be the first JAK inhibitor in the European Union to treat moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older.<sup class=""last-child"">3</sup>

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About Atopic Dermatitis</b>

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition characterized by a cycle of intense itching and scratching leading to cracked, scaly, oozing skin.<sup class=""first-child"">11,12</sup> It affects up to an estimated 10 percent of adults and 25 percent of children.<sup>12,13</sup> Between 20 and 46 percent of adults with atopic dermatitis have moderate to severe disease.<sup>14 </sup>The range of symptoms poses significant physical, psychological and economic burden on individuals impacted by the disease.<sup class=""last-child"">12,15</sup>

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About the RINVOQ Atopic Dermatitis Global Phase 3 Study Program</b>

The global Phase 3 program evaluated more than 2,500 patients worldwide across three global pivotal studies: Measure Up 1, Measure Up 2 and AD Up.<sup class=""first-child"">1,2</sup> The studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of RINVOQ (15 mg and 30 mg, once daily), with and without topical corticosteroids (TCS), in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who were candidates for systemic therapy.<sup>1,2</sup> The co-primary endpoints across all three studies were at least a 75 percent improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) and a validated Investigator's Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score 0/1 at week 16.<sup>1,2 </sup>Secondary endpoints included reduction of itch defined as =4 point improvement in Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from baseline at week 16 and other timepoints, as well as EASI 90 and EASI 100 at week 16.<sup>1,2</sup> More information on this program can be found at <a class=""last-child"" href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a> (NCT03569293, NCT03607422, NCT03568318).

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About RINVOQ<sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup> (upadacitinib)</b>

Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.<sup class=""first-child"">1-10</sup> In human cellular assays, RINVOQ preferentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2.<sup>3</sup> In <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2019</span>, RINVOQ received U.S. FDA approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. RINVOQ is approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs); for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs; and for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. The approved dose for RINVOQ in these indications is 15 mg. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis are ongoing.<sup class=""last-child"">4-10</sup> Use of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis is not approved and its safety and efficacy are under evaluation by regulatory authorities.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">Important EU Safety Information about RINVOQ<sup class=""first-child"">®</sup> (upadacitinib)<sup class=""last-child"">3</sup></b>

RINVOQ is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients, in patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections, in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and during pregnancy.

Use in combination with other potent immunosuppressants is not recommended.

Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving upadacitinib. The most frequent serious infections reported included pneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of bacterial meningitis have been reported. Among opportunistic infections, TB, multidermatomal herpes zoster, oral/oesophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis have been reported with upadacitinib. Prior to initiating upadacitinib, consider the risks and benefits of treatment in patients with chronic or recurrent infection or with a history of a serious or opportunistic infection, in patients who have been exposed to TB or have resided or travelled in areas of endemic TB or endemic mycoses, and in patients with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection. As there is a higher incidence of infections in patients =65 years of age, caution should be used when treating this population.

Patients should be screened for TB before starting upadacitinib therapy. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiation of upadacitinib in patients with previously untreated latent TB or in patients with risk factors for TB infection.

Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes zoster, were reported in clinical studies. The risk of herpes zoster appears to be higher in Japanese patients treated with upadacitinib. Consider interruption of therapy if a patient develops herpes zoster until the episode resolves. Screening for viral hepatitis and monitoring for reactivation should be performed before starting and during therapy with upadacitinib.

The use of live, attenuated vaccines during, or immediately prior to therapy is not recommended. It is recommended that patients be brought up to date with all immunizations, including prophylactic zoster vaccinations, prior to initiating upadacitinib, in agreement with current immunization guidelines.

The risk of malignancies, including lymphoma is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancies, including lymphoma. The clinical data are currently limited and long-term studies are ongoing. Malignancies, including non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), have been reported in patients treated with upadacitinib. Consider the risks and benefits of upadacitinib treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated NMSC or when considering continuing upadacitinib therapy in patients who develop a malignancy. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup class=""first-child"">3</sup>, absolute lymphocyte count &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, or haemoglobin levels &lt;8 g/dL were reported in <u class=""last-child"">&lt;</u>1% of patients in clinical trials. Treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients with these haematological abnormalities observed during routine patient management.

RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients treated with upadacitinib should have risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.

Upadacitinib treatment was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

Treatment with upadacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. If increases in ALT or AST are observed during routine patient management and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded.

Events of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, including upadacitinib. Upadacitinib should be used with caution in patients at high risk for DVT/PE. Risk factors that should be considered in determining the patient's risk for DVT/PE include older age, obesity, a medical history of DVT/PE, patients undergoing major surgery, and prolonged immobilisation. If clinical features of DVT/PE occur, upadacitinib treatment should be discontinued and patients should be evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate treatment.

The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions were upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, nausea, blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased and cough. The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections.

Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with upadacitinib 15 mg was consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. A higher incidence of acne and bronchitis was observed in patients treated with upadacitinib compared to placebo. A higher rate of serious infections and hepatic transaminase elevations was observed in patients treated with upadacitinib in combination with MTX compared to monotherapy.

Basel, 25 June 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for intravenous Actemra/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults and paediatric patients (two years of age and older) who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The EUA is based on results from four randomised, controlled studies that evaluated Actemra/RoActemra for the treatment of COVID-19 in more than 5,500 hospitalised patients. The results of these studies suggest that Actemra/RoActemra may improve outcomes in patients receiving corticosteroids and requiring supplemental oxygen or breathing support.

“Even with the availability of vaccines and declines in deaths from COVID-19 in various parts of the world, we continue to see new hospitalisations from severe forms of the disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are pleased that Actemra/RoActemra is now authorised as an option that may help improve outcomes for adults and children hospitalised with COVID-19 in the United States.”

The four randomised, controlled studies included in the EUA submission investigated the safety and efficacy of Actemra/RoActemra in more than 5,500 hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The RECOVERY Actemra/RoActemra study was led by researchers in the United Kingdom and included more than 4,000 hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Roche-sponsored global trials included the placebo-controlled EMPACTA, COVACTA and REMDACTA studies. There have been no new safety signals identified for Actemra/RoActemra in any of these studies. The most common adverse reactions seen (incidence = 3%) are constipation, anxiety, diarrhoea, insomnia, hypertension and nausea.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with society, governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

<strong>About the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for </strong><strong>Actemra</strong><strong>/</strong><strong>RoActemra</strong>
Actemra/RoActemra has not been approved by the U.S. FDA in this setting, but the U.S. FDA has made Actemra/RoActemra available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA as a treatment for certain patients with COVID-19. There is limited information known about the safety or effectiveness of using Actemra/RoActemra to treat people in the hospital with COVID-19. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authorisation is temporary and does not replace the formal review and approval process. Actemra/RoActemra is authorised under the EUA only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorisation of the emergency use of Actemra/RoActemra under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C.§ 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorisation is terminated or revoked sooner. Roche has existing distribution channels established to ship Actemra/RoActemra to hospitals across the United States.

<strong>About the </strong><strong>Actemra</strong><strong>/</strong><strong>RoActemra</strong><strong> COVID-19 Clinical Trial </strong><strong>Programme</strong>
Roche’s clinical trial programme evaluated the safety and efficacy of Actemra/RoActemra in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Actemra/RoActemra is not approved for this use in any country and there is limited information known about the safety or effectiveness of using Actemra to treat people in the hospital with COVID-19. COVACTA and EMPACTA were the first two global phase III, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of Actemra/RoActemra in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 associated pneumonia. COVACTA was conducted in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). EMPACTA aimed to address research questions about the safety and efficacy of Actemra in underserved populations by emphasising enrollment from minority patients often underrepresented in clinical trials. Both studies were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Roche also partnered with Gilead Sciences, Inc., on REMDACTA, a phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Actemra/RoActemra plus Veklury® (remdesivir), versus placebo plus Veklury, in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia.

<strong>About </strong><strong>Actemra</strong><strong>/</strong><strong>RoActemra</strong>
Actemra/RoActemra was the first humanised interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have used one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate (MTX), that did not provide enough relief. The extensive Actemra/RoActemra RA IV clinical development programme included five phase III clinical studies and enrolled more than 4,000 people with RA in 41 countries. The Actemra/RoActemra RA subcutaneous clinical development programme included two phase III clinical studies and enrolled more than 1,800 people with RA in 33 countries. Actemra/RoActemra subcutaneous injection is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA), for the treatment of patients two years of age and older with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) or active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adult patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). In addition, Actemra/RoActemra is also approved in the IV formulation for patients two years of age and older with active PJIA, SJIA or CAR T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Actemra/RoActemra is not approved for subcutaneous use in people with CRS. It is not known if Actemra is safe and effective in children with PJIA, SJIA or CRS under two years of age or in children with conditions other than PJIA, SJIA or CRS. Actemra is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare practitioner.

<strong>About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>
As a leading healthcare company we are doing all we can to support countries in their fight against COVID-19 and minimising its impact. We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help to detect and diagnose the infection, as well as providing digital support to healthcare systems. We also continue to identify, develop and support potential therapies which can play a role in treating the disease.

The impact of COVID-19 goes beyond those who contract it. That is why we are working with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need during these challenging times. Building on a longstanding tradition of partnerships, we are working together with governments and others to make healthcare stronger and more sustainable in the future.

Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic and Roche has so far launched 16 diagnostics solutions to help minimise the impact of COVID-19. As soon as the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus was sequenced in early 2020, we got to work. On 13 March 2020 we became the first company to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a high-volume molecular test to detect the virus. Since then, we have continued to add a range of diagnostics solutions to our global portfolio to help in the fight against COVID-19. In addition to the gold standard PCR test, we have developed antigen tests to help diagnose the virus in settings where there is limited molecular laboratory infrastructure, rapid antigen where the virus can be detected on the spot, tests that can test for both flu and COVID-19 at the same time, both high throughput and at the point of care, and tests that can detect virus antibodies that can help monitor the spread of the virus and can also support in vaccine development. On 16 March 2021 the SARS-CoV-2 variant test was launched, designed to detect key spike mutations.

Aside from these tests we have also looked at how we can support care for patients who have COVID-19, receiving an U.S. FDA EUA for the Elecsys® IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as launching Roche v-TAC, a digital algorithm that could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory-compromised patients with COVID-19. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to support availability of tests globally.

Roche is actively involved in understanding the potential of the existing portfolio and is researching options for the future. In 2020, Roche entered into a number of new partnerships, including with Gilead, Regeneron and Atea, to develop, manufacture and distribute molecules that can potentially both treat and prevent COVID-19.

In October, Roche announced a partnership with Atea Pharmaceuticals to jointly develop the investigational compound AT-527. If approved, Atea will distribute AT-527 in the United States (US) and Roche will be responsible for global manufacturing and distribution outside the US. Atea’s compound has the potential to be the first oral antiviral to treat COVID-19 patients outside the hospital setting as well as in the hospital. Its anticipated formulation (pill) may help to facilitate access to a broad patient population.

In November, our partner Regeneron received U.S. FDA EUA for casirivimab and imdevimab, its investigational antiviral antibody combination, for the treatment of recently diagnosed patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalisation. The antibody cocktail has been studied in two phase I-III adaptive clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 and in a phase III trial for the prevention of the disease. As part of the global partnership with Regeneron, we are committing a significant amount of manufacturing capacity and are working to expand supply of this antibody combination beyond the US to as many people as possible.

In addition, we are exploring the potential of our investigational molecules and existing portfolio: For example, Roche has initiated three global phase III clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of Actemra/RoActemra in COVID-19 associated pneumonia (COVACTA, EMPACTA and REMDACTA). Roche will continue to monitor the evolving clinical evidence for Actemra/RoActemra in this setting.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved the PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab) for the first-line treatment of adults with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumor cells have =50% PD-L1 expression and no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations. Patients must have metastatic NSCLC or locally advanced NSCLC and not be a candidate for definitive chemoradiation.

Libtayo is now approved for three advanced cancers in the European Union. The EC also approved Libtayo in advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the first treatment to be indicated for those patients who have progressed on or are intolerant to a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI). In 2019, Libtayo was approved by the EC as the first treatment for adults with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. Across all of its approved indications, Libtayo had a generally consistent safety profile. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue during or after treatment with Libtayo.

“Libtayo has demonstrated a highly significant improvement in overall survival compared to chemotherapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with high PD-L1 expression and a variety of challenging-to-treat disease characteristics,” said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron. “Beyond the primary analysis, we continue to conduct post-hoc analyses of our Phase 3 trial with the goal of informing treatment in this patient population.”

The EC approval in advanced NSCLC is based on data from a global Phase 3 trial that enrolled 710 patients from 24 countries. The trial, which was one of the largest for a PD-1 inhibitor in advanced NSCLC, was designed to be more reflective of clinical practice by including challenging-to-treat and often underrepresented disease characteristics. Among those enrolled, 12% had pre-treated and clinically stable brain metastases, 44% had squamous cell histology and 16% had locally advanced NSCLC that was not a candidate for definitive chemoradiation. Furthermore, patients whose disease progressed in the trial were able to change their therapy: those assigned to chemotherapy could crossover to Libtayo treatment, while those assigned to Libtayo monotherapy could continue Libtayo treatment and add four cycles of chemotherapy.

In the overall study population, Libtayo significantly reduced the risk of death by 32% and extended median overall survival (OS) by 8 months compared to chemotherapy, even with 74% of patients crossing over to Libtayo following disease progression on chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53-0.87; p=0.0022). The median OS was 22 months for Libtayo (range: 18 months to not evaluable) and 14 months for chemotherapy (range: 12 to 19 months). A prespecified analysis of data from patients whose cancers had PD-L1 expression =50% (n=563) based on a validated assay was also conducted. As published in The Lancet, Libtayo reduced the risk of death by 43% for patients in this population; median OS was not reached for Libtayo (95% CI: 18 months to not evaluable) and was 14 months for chemotherapy (95% CI: 11 to 18 months).

In the Phase 3 trial, safety was assessed in 697 patients, with a duration of exposure of 27 weeks (range: 9 days to 115 weeks) for the Libtayo group and 18 weeks (range: 18 days to 87 weeks) for the chemotherapy group. Serious adverse reactions (AEs) in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia (5% Libtayo, 6% chemotherapy) and pneumonitis (2% Libtayo, 0% chemotherapy). Treatment was permanently discontinued due to AEs in 6% of Libtayo patients; AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation in at least 2 patients were pneumonitis, pneumonia, ischemic stroke and increased aspartate aminotransferase. No new Libtayo safety signals were observed.

“We are confident that Libtayo has the potential to become an important treatment option for patients in the European Union and thank all the investigators, patients and their families who helped us reach this milestone,” said Peter C. Adamson, M.D., Global Development Head, Oncology at Sanofi. “We are anticipating results from our ongoing Phase 3 trial of Libtayo plus chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and remain committed to studying Libtayo in additional cancer settings where there is the potential to improve the outcome for patients.”

About the Phase 3 Trial in Advanced NSCLC
EMPOWER-Lung 1 was an open-label, randomized, multi-center Phase 3 trial designed to investigate Libtayo monotherapy compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC who tested positive for PD-L1 in =50% of tumor cells and had no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations. PD-L1 expression was confirmed using the Agilent Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit.

The trial randomized 710 patients 1:1 who had either previously untreated metastatic NSCLC (stage IV) or locally advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB/C) who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation or who had progressed after treatment with definitive chemoradiation. Those receiving Libtayo were intravenously administered a 350 mg dose every three weeks for up to 108 weeks, while those receiving chemotherapy received an investigator-selected, platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimen for four to six cycles (with or without maintenance pemetrexed chemotherapy).

The primary endpoints were OS and progression-free survival, and secondary endpoints included objective response rate, duration of response and quality of life. In 2020, the trial was stopped early due to a significant improvement in OS.

About Libtayo
Libtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.

The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Current clinical development programs include Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC irrespective of PD-L1 expression and Libtayo monotherapy for advanced cervical cancer. Libtayo is also being investigated in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

The generic name for Libtayo in its approved U.S. indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Libtayo is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.

About Regeneron’s VelocImmune® Technology
Regeneron’s VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron’s President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original, FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN–COV™ (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent® (dupilumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS

What is Libtayo?
Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery (locally advanced BCC) and have received treatment with an HHI, or cannot receive treatment with an HHI.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma that has spread (metastatic BCC) and have received treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI), or cannot receive treatment with an HHI. This use is approved based on how many patients responded to treatment and how long they responded. Studies are ongoing to provide additional information about clinical benefit.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Libtayo may be used as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, or your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), and your tumor tests positive for high “PD-L1” and your tumor does not have an abnormal “EGFR”, “ALK “or “ROS1” gene.

It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.

What is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?
Libtayo is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system. Libtayo can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can sometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. You can have more than one of these problems at the same time. These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended.

Call or see your healthcare provider right away if you develop any new or worsening signs or symptoms, including:

Lung problems: cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain
Intestinal problems: diarrhea (loose stools) or more frequent bowel movements than usual, stools that are black, tarry, sticky or have blood or mucus, or severe stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tenderness
Liver problems: yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, severe nausea or vomiting, pain on the right side of your stomach area (abdomen), dark urine (tea colored), or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal
Hormone gland problems: headache that will not go away or unusual headaches, eye sensitivity to light, eye problems, rapid heartbeat, increased sweating, extreme tiredness, weight gain or weight loss, feeling more hungry or thirsty than usual, urinating more often than usual, hair loss, feeling cold, constipation, your voice gets deeper, dizziness or fainting, or changes in mood or behavior, such as decreased sex drive, irritability, or forgetfulness
Kidney problems: decrease in your amount of urine, blood in your urine, swelling of your ankles, or loss of appetite
Skin problems: rash, itching, skin blistering or peeling, painful sores or ulcers in mouth or nose, throat, or genital area, fever or flu-like symptoms, or swollen lymph nodes
Problems can also happen in other organs and tissues. These are not all of the signs and symptoms of immune system problems that can happen with Libtayo. Call or see your healthcare provider right away for any new or worsening signs or symptoms, which may include: chest pain, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath or swelling of ankles, confusion, sleepiness, memory problems, changes in mood or behavior, stiff neck, balance problems, tingling or numbness of the arms or legs, double vision, blurry vision, sensitivity to light, eye pain, changes in eyesight, persistent or severe muscle pain or weakness, muscle cramps, low red blood cells, or bruising
Infusion reactions that can sometimes be severe. Signs and symptoms of infusion reactions may include: nausea, chills or shaking, itching or rash, flushing, shortness of breath or wheezing, dizziness, feel like passing out, fever, back or neck pain, or facial swelling
Rejection of a transplanted organ. Your healthcare provider should tell you what signs and symptoms you should report and monitor you, depending on the type of organ transplant that you have had.
Complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in people who have received a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic). These complications can be serious and can lead to death. These complications may happen if you underwent transplantation either before or after being treated with Libtayo. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for these complications.
Getting medical treatment right away may help keep these problems from becoming more serious. Your healthcare provider will check you for these problems during your treatment with Libtayo. Your healthcare provider may treat you with corticosteroid or hormone replacement medicines. Your healthcare provider may also need to delay or completely stop treatment with Libtayo if you have severe side effects.

Before you receive Libtayo, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you:

have immune system problems such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or lupus
have received an organ transplant
have received or plan to receive a stem cell transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic)
have a condition that affects your nervous system, such as myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Libtayo can harm your unborn baby
Females who are able to become pregnant:
– Your healthcare provider will give you a pregnancy test before you start treatment.
– You should use an effective method of birth control during your treatment and for at least 4 months after your last dose of Libtayo. Talk with your healthcare provider about birth control methods that you can use during this time.
– Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment with Libtayo.

are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Libtayo passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of Libtayo.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over- the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

The most common side effects of Libtayo include muscle or bone pain, tiredness, rash, and diarrhea. These are not all the possible side effects of Libtayo. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi at 1-877-542-8296.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <b>REGN</b>) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved the PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab) to treat adults with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) who have progressed on or are intolerant to a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI).

BCC is the most common type of skin cancer worldwide, representing up to 80% of non-melanoma skin cancers, and incidence is increasing across many European countries. While the large majority of BCCs are caught early and easily cured with surgery and/or radiation, a small proportion of cases can develop into advanced BCC and penetrate deeper into surrounding tissues (locally advanced) or spread to other parts of the body (metastatic), becoming more difficult to treat.

""Libtayo is the first immunotherapy to show a clinical benefit in patients with advanced BCC after HHI therapy in a pivotal trial, and with this first-in-class approval has the potential to transform treatment for patients in Europe whose cancer has progressed despite HHI treatment,"" said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron. ""We look forward to continuing to investigate this medicine in additional settings, with the goal of helping more patients with difficult-to-treat cancers around the world.""

Libtayo is now approved for three advanced cancers in the European Union, following the EC's concurrent <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3209053-1&amp;h=1757681640&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.regeneron.com%2Findex.php%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Flibtayor-cemiplimab-approved-european-commission-first-line&amp;a=approval"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">approval</a> of Libtayo for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumor cells have =50% PD-L1 expression and no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations. In 2019, Libtayo was <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3209053-1&amp;h=3258321876&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Flibtayor-cemiplimab-approved-advanced-cutaneous-squamous-cell%2F&amp;a=approved"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">approved</a> by the EC as the first treatment for adults with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. Across all of its approved indications, Libtayo had a generally consistent safety profile. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue during or after treatment with Libtayo.

The EC approval in BCC is based on data from the largest prospective clinical trial (n=119) in patients with advanced BCC previously treated with an HHI to date. Libtayo-treated patients with locally advanced BCC experienced an objective response rate (ORR) of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22-43) (25% partial response, 7% complete response) by independent central review. Libtayo-treated patients with metastatic BCC demonstrated an ORR of 29% (95% CI: 15-46) (26% partial response, 3% complete response) by investigator assessment. In addition, approximately 90% of patients across both groups had a duration of response (DOR) of 6 months or longer per Kaplan Meier estimates, and the median DOR has not been reached for either group. Median duration of follow-up was 16 months for locally advanced BCC and 9 months for metastatic BCC.

Safety was assessed in 816 patients across all four Libtayo monotherapy pivotal trials in its approved indications. Adverse events were serious in 30% of patients and led to permanent discontinuation in 8% of patients. Immune–related adverse reactions occurred in 22% of patients and led to permanent discontinuation in 4% of patients. The most common immune-related adverse reactions were hypothyroidism (8%), hyperthyroidism (3%), pneumonitis (3%), hepatitis (2%), colitis (2%) and immune-related skin adverse reactions (2%).

""Since its launch in Europe just two years ago, Libtayo has redefined the standard of care for advanced CSCC and has the potential to do the same in advanced BCC,"" said Peter C. Adamson, M.D., Global Development Head, Oncology at Sanofi. ""Together with Regeneron, we're committed to addressing gaps in the treatment of advanced forms of non-melanoma skin cancer.""

<b>About the Phase 2 Trial in Advanced BCC</b>

The EC approval was based on data from an ongoing open-label, multi-center, non-randomized Phase 2 trial of patients with unresectable locally advanced BCC or metastatic BCC (nodal or distant). Patients in both cohorts had either progressed on HHI therapy, had not had an objective response after nine months on HHI therapy, or were intolerant of prior HHI therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed ORR, and a key secondary endpoint was DOR, assessed by independent central review.

<b>About Libtayo</b>

Libtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.

The recommended dose of Libtayo is 350 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Libtayo is available as a single-dose 350 mg vial. No PD-L1 or tumor mutational burden (TMB) testing is required before starting treatment with Libtayo for advanced BCC.

The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Current clinical development programs include Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC irrespective of PD-L1 expression and Libtayo monotherapy for advanced cervical cancer. Libtayo is also being investigated in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

The generic name for Libtayo in its approved U.S. indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Libtayo is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS</b>

<b>What is Libtayo?</b>

&nbsp;

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.

&nbsp;

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery (locally advanced BCC) and have received treatment with an HHI, or cannot receive treatment with an HHI.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma that has spread (metastatic BCC) and have received treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI), or cannot receive treatment with an HHI. This use is approved based on how many patients responded to treatment and how long they responded. Studies are ongoing to provide additional information about clinical benefit.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Libtayo may be used as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, or your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), and your tumor tests positive for high ""PD-L1"" and your tumor does not have an abnormal ""EGFR"", ""ALK ""or ""ROS1"" gene.

It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.

<b>What is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?</b>

Libtayo is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system. Libtayo can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can sometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. You can have more than one of these problems at the same time. These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended.

The first participants in a Phase II/III trial for the new COVID-19 variant vaccine AZD2816 were vaccinated today to assess its safety and immunogenicity in both previously vaccinated and unvaccinated adults.

The trial will recruit approximately 2,250 participants across UK, South Africa, Brazil and Poland.

AZD2816 will be administered to individuals who have previously been fully vaccinated with two doses of <i>Vaxzevria </i>or an mRNA vaccine, at least three months after their last injection. In non-vaccinated individuals, AZD2816 will be given as two doses, four or twelve weeks apart, or given as a second dose following a first dose of <i>Vaxzevria </i>four weeks apart.

AZD2816 has been designed using the same adenoviral vector platform as <i>Vaxzevria</i>, with minor genetic alterations to the spike protein based on the Beta (B.1.351, South African) variant.

Sir Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “It is important we continue to stay ahead of genetically distinct variants of the coronavirus. AZD2816 should help broaden individuals immune response against emerging variants of concern. Initiating the Phase II/III trial for AZD2816 means we can be prepared should a variant vaccine be required in the future.”

Professor Sir Andrew J Pollard, chief investigator and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford, said: “Testing booster doses of existing vaccines and new variant vaccines is important to ensure we are best prepared to stay ahead of the coronavirus pandemic, should their use be needed.”

Initial data from the trial is expected later this year and, once available, will be submitted to regulators for assessment as a next-generation booster vaccine and through an expedited regulatory pathway.

<b>D7220C00001
</b>D7220C00001 is a Phase II/III partially double-blinded, randomised, multinational, active-controlled trial in both previously vaccinated and unvaccinated adults to determine the safety and immunogenicity of AZD2816, a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 caused by variant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Trial participants aged 18 years or over who are SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid seronegative will be randomised to minimise group differences in terms of age, gender and the presence of comorbidities. Participants will receive intramuscular administration of either <i>Vaxzevria </i>(5 ×10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) or AZD2816 (5 ×10<sup>10</sup> viral particles). In addition, seropositive participants will be enrolled, with a cap of 10% of the seronegative population, to support exploratory analysis.

<b>AZD2816
</b>AZD2816 has been built using the same adenoviral vector platform as with <i>Vaxzevria</i>, with minor genetic alterations to the spike protein based on the Beta (B.1.351, South African) variant. The Beta variant vaccine contains ten changes across the spike protein, many of which are also seen in other variants of concern, and which lead to effects such as, reduced ability of antibodies induced against the original virus to block cell entry (K417N, E484K, N501Y); increased infectivity compared to the original virus (D614G); reduced sensitivity of neutralising antibodies to the original virus (L452R). These modifications are only minor and in all other ways the two vaccines are the same.

<b><i>Vaxzevria</i>, formally AZD1222
</b><i>Vaxzevria </i>was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

The vaccine has been granted a conditional marketing authorisation or emergency use in more than 80 countries across six continents. More than 600 million doses of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca have been supplied to 170 countries worldwide, including more than 100 countries through the COVAX Facility. In the UK, <i>Vaxzevria </i>is known as <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i>.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","SAN DIEGO, June 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRTX), a clinical-stage targeted oncology company, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to adagrasib for the potential treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who harbor the KRASG12C mutation following prior systemic therapy.

Breakthrough Therapy Designation is an FDA program designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of drugs that have demonstrated preliminary clinical evidence of a substantial improvement over available therapy in the treatment of patients with serious diseases on at least one clinically significant endpoint.

The designation for adagrasib is supported by preliminary results from the registrational Phase 1/2 KRYSTAL-01 trial in patients with advanced NSCLC, whose cancer had progressed following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy.

“We are pleased to receive this breakthrough therapy designation for adagrasib, which emphasizes the significant need for new treatment options for patients with lung cancer who harbor the KRASG12C mutation,” said Charles M. Baum, M.D., Ph.D., president and chief executive officer, Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. “We look forward to submitting a New Drug Application for adagrasib in the second half of this year and further advancing adagrasib across a broad development plan with the goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with KRASG12C mutated cancers.”

About KRASG12C in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, accounting for 2.21 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths worldwide in 2020. Lung cancer consists of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in approximately 85 percent of cases and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in approximately 15 percent of cases. KRASG12C is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC, present in approximately 14 percent of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and is a biomarker mutation of poor prognosis.

About Adagrasib (MRTX849)

Adagrasib is an investigational, highly selective, and potent oral small-molecule inhibitor of KRASG12C that is optimized to sustain target inhibition, an attribute that could be important to treat KRASG12C mutated cancers, as the KRASG12C protein regenerates every 24-48 hours. Studies of adagrasib have shown that the drug has a long half-life, extensive tissue distribution and is well tolerated. Adagrasib has also shown single-agent responses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other solid tumors with KRASG12C mutations. Adagrasib is a being evaluated in several clinical trials in combination with other anti-cancer therapies with strong scientific rationale in patients with advanced solid tumors. Registration-enabling studies are ongoing in NSCLC and colorectal cancer. For more information visit Mirati.com/science.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","INDIANAPOLIS, June 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Tirzepatide led to superior A1C and body weight reductions from baseline across all three doses in adults with type 2 diabetes after 40 weeks of treatment in Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) SURPASS-1 monotherapy clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared to placebo. Detailed SURPASS-1 results were presented today in an oral presentation during the American Diabetes Association’s® (ADA) 81st Scientific Sessions®, were simultaneously published in The Lancet and will be featured during an ADA-sponsored symposium on Tuesday, June 29.

Study participants in SURPASS-1, 54.2 percent of whom were treatment-naïve, had a relatively short mean duration of diabetes of 4.7 years, a baseline A1C of 7.9 percent and a baseline weight of 85.9 kg. For the efficacy estimandi, tirzepatide reduced A1C by up to 2.07 percent and body weight by up to 9.5 kg (20.9 lb., 11.0 percent) compared to placebo (+0.04 A1C change and body weight change of -0.7 kg [1.5 lb., 0.9 percent]). Up to 52 percent of participants achieved an A1C less than 5.7 percent – the level seen in people without diabetes. Tirzepatide also led to improvements in the change in fasting serum glucose from baseline. In an additional secondary endpoint, tirzepatide led to improvements in the change in two-hour post-meal glucose values from baseline from self-monitored blood glucose data.1,2

The overall safety profile of tirzepatide was similar to the well-established glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class, with gastrointestinal side effects being the most commonly reported adverse events. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were less than 7 percent in each tirzepatide treatment arm.1

“Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, and many people with the condition have trouble reaching their A1C goals through diet and exercise. This monotherapy clinical trial was designed to assess the impact of tirzepatide alone on several important diabetes treatment targets, including glycemic control and weight loss,” said Julio Rosenstock, M.D., Director of the Dallas Diabetes Research Center at Medical City and Principal Investigator of SURPASS-1. “In the SURPASS-1 results, tirzepatide led to significant improvements across all primary and key secondary endpoints with clinically meaningful A1C reductions and robust weight loss among study participants, who had a relatively short duration of type 2 diabetes.”

Tirzepatide is a novel investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist that integrates the actions of the GIP and GLP-1 incretins into a single molecule, representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

For both estimandsii, all three tirzepatide doses reached statistical significance in A1C and body weight reductions from baseline and in the percentage of participants who achieved an A1C of less than 7 percent (the American Diabetes Association’s recommended target for people with diabetes) or less than 5.7 percent.1

At 40 weeks, tirzepatide led to a significant decrease in fasting serum glucose (FSG) compared to placebo. In an additional secondary endpoint, the mean two-hour post-meal glucose values for tirzepatide across all three doses were under 140 mg/dL (considered normal values in individuals without diabetes).2

Specifically, the efficacy estimand results showed:

A1C change: -1.87% (5 mg), -1.89% (10 mg), -2.07% (15 mg), +0.04% (placebo)
Weight reduction: -7.0 kg (-7.9%, 5 mg), -7.8 kg (-9.3%, 10 mg), -9.5 kg (-11.0%, 15 mg), -0.7 kg (-0.9%, placebo)
Percent of participants achieving A1C <7%: 87% (5 mg), 92% (10 mg), 88% (15 mg), 20% (placebo)
Percent of participants achieving A1C <5.7%: 34% (5 mg), 31% (10 mg), 52% (15 mg), 1% (placebo)
Change in FSG: -43.6 mg/dL (5 mg), -45.9 mg/dL (10 mg), -49.3 mg/dL (15 mg), +12.9 mg/dL (placebo)
The treatment-regimen estimandiii results showed:

A1C reduction: -1.75% (5 mg), -1.71% (10 mg), -1.69% (15 mg), -0.09% (placebo)
Weight reduction: -6.3 kg (5 mg), -7.0 kg (10 mg), -7.8 kg (15 mg), -1.0 kg (placebo)
Percent of participants achieving A1C <7%: 82% (5 mg), 85% (10 mg), 78% (15 mg), 23% (placebo)
Percent of participants achieving A1C <5.7%: 31% (5 mg), 27% (10 mg), 38% (15 mg), 1% (placebo)
Change in FSG: -39.6 mg/dL (5 mg), -39.8 mg/dL (10 mg), -38.6 mg/dL (15 mg), +3.7 mg/dL (placebo)
No events of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia less than 54 mg/dL were observed in the tirzepatide treatment arms.1,2

In an additional exploratory endpoint, all three doses of tirzepatide led to favorable changes from baseline in fasting lipids. Specifically, at the highest dose of tirzepatide (15 mg): total cholesterol was reduced by 8.4 percent, triglycerides were reduced by 21.0 percent, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was reduced by 12.4 percent, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol was reduced by 19.8 percent, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was increased by 7.5 percent.2

The most commonly reported adverse events for tirzepatide were gastrointestinal-related and mostly mild to moderate in severity, usually occurring during the dose escalation period. For study participants treated with tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively), nausea (11.6 percent, 13.2 percent, 18.2 percent, respectively), diarrhea (11.6 percent, 14.0 percent, 11.6 percent, respectively), vomiting (3.3 percent, 2.5 percent, 5.8 percent, respectively) and constipation (5.8 percent, 5.0 percent, 6.6 percent, respectively) were more frequently experienced compared to placebo (6.1 percent [nausea], 7.8 percent [diarrhea], 1.7 percent [vomiting], 0.9 percent [constipation]). The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 9.1 percent (tirzepatide 5 mg), 9.9 percent (tirzepatide 10 mg) and 21.5 percent (tirzepatide 15 mg), compared to 14.8 percent (placebo). The majority of the discontinuations in the 15 mg and placebo arms were due to reasons other than adverse events (such as concerns due to the coronavirus pandemic and family or work reasons).2

SURPASS-1 is the first of five global registration studies for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes, all of which have been completed. Lilly intends to submit the full registration package to regulatory authorities by the end of 2021.

About tirzepatide
Tirzepatide is a once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single novel molecule. GIP is a hormone that may complement the effects of GLP-1. In preclinical models, GIP has been shown to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure therefore resulting in weight reductions, and when combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, may result in greater effects on glucose and body weight. Tirzepatide is in phase 3 development for blood glucose management in adults with type 2 diabetes and for chronic weight management. It is also being studied as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

About SURPASS-1 and the SURPASS clinical trial program
SURPASS-1 (NCT03954834) is a 40-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg as monotherapy to placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone. The trial randomized 478 study participants across the U.S., Mexico, India and Japan in 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg or placebo. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg) is superior in A1C reduction from baseline after 40 weeks in people with type 2 diabetes naïve to injectable therapy who haven’t used any oral antidiabetic medicines within three months compared to placebo. Study participants had a mean A1C between 7 percent and 9.5 percent and a BMI greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2. All participants in the tirzepatide treatment arms started the study at a dose of tirzepatide 2.5 mg once-weekly and then increased the dose in a step-wise approach at four-week intervals to their final randomized maintenance dose of 5 mg (via a 2.5 mg step), 10 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 7.5 mg) or 15 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg and 12.5 mg).

The SURPASS phase 3 global clinical development program for tirzepatide has enrolled more than 19,000 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, five of which are global registration studies. The program began in late 2018, and all five global registration trials have been completed.

About Diabetes

Basel, 28 June 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved ENSPRYNG® (satralizumab) for the treatment of adults and adolescents from 12 years of age living with anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-IgG) seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), as a monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy (IST). ENSPRYNG is the first and only NMOSD treatment that is administered subcutaneously every four weeks, allowing home-dosing after appropriate training.

“An NMOSD relapse can be devastating, causing permanent neurological damage and disability that accumulates with subsequent relapses, which is why our goal is to prevent them,” said Prof. Dr. Friedemann Paul, Professor of Clinical Neuroimmunology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin. “With the approval of ENSPRYNG, we now have a treatment option with a favourable safety profile that significantly reduces relapses in AQP4-IgG seropositive adults and adolescents after their first NMOSD attack or in more advanced disease, either as a monotherapy or in combination with IST. Importantly, people with NMOSD now have the flexibility to administer treatment at home, which may alleviate the need to travel for hospital appointments.”

The EC approval is supported by results from two Phase III studies, in which ENSPRYNG showed robust and sustained efficacy in reducing the risk of relapse in people with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD. AQP4-IgG are present in around 70-80% of people with NMOSD, who tend to experience a more severe disease course compared to those not expressing AQP4-IgG antibodies.

“We thank the NMOSD community for their partnership and are delighted that ENSPRYNG will be available to people in the EU who until now had limited, accessible treatment options,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Building on our growing scientific understanding of neuroimmunological conditions, we are confident ENSPRYNG can transform how people with NMOSD are treated by fitting into their day-to-day lives.”

ENSPRYNG is the first and only approved medicine for NMOSD in the EU designed to bind to and block the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, a central driver of the inflammation associated with NMOSD. The treatment was designed by Chugai, a member of the Roche Group, using novel recycling antibody technology. When compared to conventional antibodies, ENSPRYNG’s recycling antibody technology enables the medicine to remain in the bloodstream for a longer period of time and bind repeatedly to its target (the IL-6 receptor) – maximally sustaining IL-6 suppression in a chronic disease like NMOSD and enabling subcutaneous dosing every four weeks.

Roche is working closely with reimbursement and health technology assessment bodies in EU member states to provide access to ENSPRYNG for people who may benefit from this treatment option as soon as possible.

<strong>About </strong><strong>SAkuraStar</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>SAkuraSky</strong><strong> in NMOSD</strong>
ENSPRYNG has been investigated in two pivotal Phase III studies in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), with the primary endpoint of both studies being time to first protocol-defined relapse (PDR) adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period.

The Phase III SAkuraStar study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ENSPRYNG monotherapy administered to adults with NMOSD. In the anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-IgG) seropositive subgroup, 83% treated with ENSPRYNG remained relapse free at 48 weeks, compared with 55% of those treated with placebo. At 96 weeks, 77% of those treated with ENSPRYNG remained relapse free, compared with 41% with placebo.

The Phase III SAkuraSky study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ENSPRYNG in combination with baseline immunosuppressive therapy in adults and adolescents with NMOSD. Overall, 92% of AQP4-IgG seropositive participants receiving ENSPRYNG in combination with IST remained relapse free at 48 and 96 weeks, compared with 60% and 53% with placebo, respectively.

ENSPRYNG showed a favourable safety and tolerability profile in the Phase III studies. The most common adverse reactions observed in the safety population were: headache, arthralgia, white blood cell count decrease, hyperlipidaemia and injection-related reactions.

<strong>About </strong><strong>neuromyelitis</strong> <strong>optica</strong><strong> spectrum disorder (NMOSD</strong><strong>)</strong>
NMOSD is a rare, lifelong and debilitating autoimmune condition of the central nervous system that primarily damages the optic nerve(s) and spinal cord, causing permanent blindness, muscle weakness and paralysis. People with NMOSD experience unpredictable, severe relapses directly causing cumulative, permanent, neurological damage and disability. In some cases, relapse can result in death. NMOSD affects over 10,000 people in Europe, up to 15,000 people in the US and approximately 200,000 people worldwide. NMOSD can affect individuals of any age, race and gender, but is most common among women in their 30s and 40s, and appears to occur at higher rates in people of African or Asian background.

NMOSD is commonly associated with pathogenic antibodies (AQP4-IgG) that target and damage a specific cell type, called astrocytes, resulting in inflammatory lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain. AQP4-IgG antibodies are detectable in the blood serum of around 70-80% of people with NMOSD.

Although most cases of NMOSD can be confirmed through diagnostic tests, people living with the condition are still frequently misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This is due to overlapping characteristics of the two disorders, including a higher prevalence in women, similar symptoms and the fact that people can experience relapses in both conditions.

<strong>About ENSPRYNG® (</strong><strong>satralizumab</strong><strong>)</strong>
ENSPRYNG, which was designed by Chugai, a member of the Roche Group, is a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor activity. The cytokine IL-6 is believed to be a key driver in NMOSD disease processes, triggering the inflammation cascade and leading to damage and disability. ENSPRYNG was designed using novel recycling antibody technology. When compared to conventional antibodies, ENSPRYNG’s recycling antibody technology enables the medicine to remain in the bloodstream for a longer period of time and bind repeatedly to its target (the IL-6 receptor) - maximally sustaining IL-6 suppression in a chronic disease like NMOSD and enabling subcutaneous dosing every four weeks.

Positive Phase III results for ENSPRYNG, as both monotherapy and in combination with baseline immunosuppressive therapy, suggest that IL-6 inhibition is an effective therapeutic approach for NMOSD. The Phase III clinical development programme for ENSPRYNG included two studies: SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky.

ENSPRYNG is currently approved in 54 countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, China and EMA territory countries.

ENSPRYNG has been designated as an orphan drug in the U.S., Europe and Japan. In addition, it was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of NMOSD by the FDA in December 2018, which is given to treatments that may demonstrate substantial improvement over other available options.

AstraZeneca’s <i>Forxiga</i> (dapagliflozin) has been recommended for approval in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults with and without type-2 diabetes (T2D).

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency based its positive opinion on results from the DAPA-CKD Phase III trial that showed <i>Forxiga</i>, on top of standard-of-care treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, reduced the risk of the composite of worsening of renal function, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and cardiovascular (CV) or renal death, compared to placebo.

<i>Forxiga</i> also significantly reduced the risk of death from any cause, compared to placebo. In the trial, the safety and tolerability of <i>Forxiga</i> were consistent with the well-established safety profile of the medicine.

CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function and is often associated with an increased risk of heart disease or stroke.<sup>1-3</sup> It affects approximately 47 million people in the EU and nearly 840 million people worldwide.<sup>3,4</sup> However, diagnosis rates remain low and up to 90% of patients are unaware they have the disease.<sup>5</sup>

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “The unprecedented results of the DAPA-CKD Phase III trial show that <i>Forxiga</i> can significantly slow the decline of kidney function and reduce the risk of death for patients with chronic kidney disease. This positive CHMP opinion underscores <i>Forxiga’s</i> potential to transform the future care of chronic kidney disease and brings us one step closer to providing a much-needed new treatment option to millions of patients in the EU.”

<i>Forxiga</i> (known as <i>Farxiga</i> in the US) was recently <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/farxiga-approved-in-the-us-for-ckd.html"">approved in the US</a> for the treatment of CKD in adults with and without T2D and, in addition to the EU, is currently under review in Japan and other countries around the world. <i>Forxiga </i>is also indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D and for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in adults with and without T2D.

<b>CKD
</b>CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function (shown by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or markers of kidney damage, or both, for at least three months).<sup>3</sup> The most common causes of CKD are diabetes, hypertension and glomerulonephritis.<sup>6</sup> CKD is associated with significant patient morbidity and an increased risk of CV events, such as HF and premature death. In its most severe form, known as ESKD, kidney damage and deterioration of kidney function have progressed to the point where dialysis or kidney transplantation are required.<sup>1</sup> The majority of patients with CKD will die from CV causes before reaching ESKD.<sup>7</sup>

<b>DAPA-CKD
</b>DAPA-CKD was an international, multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded Phase III trial in 4,304 patients designed to evaluate the efficacy of <i>Forxiga</i> 10mg, compared with placebo, in patients with CKD Stage 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D. <i>Forxiga </i>was given once daily in addition to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint was worsening of renal function or risk of death (defined as a composite of an eGFR decline =50%, onset of ESKD or death from CV or renal cause). The secondary endpoints included the time to first occurrence of the renal composite (sustained =50% eGFR decline, ESKD or renal death), the composite of CV death or hospitalisation for HF (hHF), and death from any cause. The trial was conducted in 21 countries.<sup>8 </sup>Detailed results from the trial were published in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2024816?query=main_nav_lg"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>.<sup>8</sup>

<b><i>Forxiga
</i></b><i>Forxiga</i> (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. The research for <i>Forxiga</i> is advancing from cardiorenal effects to prevention and organ protection as science continues to identify the underlying links between the heart, kidneys and pancreas. Damage to one of these organs can cause the other organs to fail, contributing to leading causes of death worldwide, including T2D, HF and CKD.

For nearly a decade <i>Forxiga</i> has been an effective monotherapy and part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D. Following results from the landmark DECLARE-TIMI 58 Phase III CV outcomes trial, it is approved in adults with T2D to reduce the risk of hHF or CV death when added to standard of care.<sup>9</sup> <i>Forxiga</i> is also <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/farxiga-approved-in-the-us-for-the-treatment-of-heart-failure-in-patients-with-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction.html"">the first SGLT2 inhibitor approved</a> for the treatment of HFrEF in adults with and without T2D.<b></b>

In August 2020, <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/farxiga-demonstrated-reduction-in-the-risk-of-kidney-failure-and-cardiovascular-or-renal-death-in-patients-with-ckd-in-the-phase-iii-dapa-ckd-trial.html"">results from the DAPA-CKD Phase III trial</a> demonstrated that <i>Forxiga</i> achieved unprecedented reduction in the composite risk of kidney failure and CV or renal death in patients with CKD with and without T2D versus placebo.<sup>8</sup> It is now <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/farxiga-approved-in-the-us-for-ckd.html"">the first SGLT2 inhibitor approved</a> for the treatment of CKD regardless of diabetes status.

DapaCare is a robust programme of clinical trials to evaluate the potential CV, renal and organ protection benefits of <i>Forxiga</i>. It includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience. It is currently being assessed in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction in the DELIVER Phase III trial. <i>Forxiga</i> is also being tested in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI Phase III trial - a first of its kind, indication-seeking registry-based randomised controlled trial.

<b>AstraZeneca in CVRM
</b>Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism (CVRM), part of BioPharmaceuticals, forms one of AstraZeneca’s three disease areas and is a key growth driver for the Company. By following the science to understand more clearly the underlying links between the heart, kidneys and pancreas, AstraZeneca is investing in a portfolio of medicines for organ protection and improve outcomes by slowing disease progression, reducing risks and tackling co-morbidities. The Company’s ambition is to modify or halt the natural course of CVRM diseases and potentially regenerate organs and restore function, by continuing to deliver transformative science that improves treatment practices and CV health for millions of patients worldwide.

INCHEON, Korea and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for BYOOVIZ™, a biosimilar candidate referencing Lucentis®<sup>1</sup> (ranibizumab), also known as SB11. Ranibizumab is an anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) for retinal vascular disorders, which are a leading cause of blindness. BYOOVIZ has been recommended for approval for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), visual impairment due to macular odemea secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or central RVO) and visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the European Union (EU).

The CHMP’s positive opinion will now be referred to the European Commission (EC), which will decide whether to grant a marketing authorization for BYOOVIZ. If a marketing authorization is granted by the EC, BYOOVIZ would be added to the biosimilars portfolio developed by Samsung Bioepis and commercialized by Biogen, including three widely prescribed anti-TNF biosimilars in Europe: BENEPALI™, IMRALDI™ and FLIXABI™.
<p align=""left"">“We are very proud to see BYOOVIZ becoming the first biosimilar of ranibizumab to be recommended for approval in Europe. This marks an important milestone for our company, as this is one step forward to expanding patient access to treatments for retinal vascular disorders,” said Kyung-Ah Kim, Senior Vice President and Development Division at Samsung Bioepis. “We will continue our efforts to develop and deliver high-quality and proven biologic medicines to more patients and healthcare systems in Europe.”</p>
“Retinal vascular disorders affect millions of people, and we believe BYOOVIZ has the potential to be a meaningful therapeutic offering for patients living with these disorders,” said Ian Henshaw, Global Head of Biosimilars at Biogen. “Biosimilars could help broaden access and offer significant healthcare savings through the treatment of these complex and often debilitating ophthalmic diseases.”

This positive CHMP opinion on BYOOVIZ was based on a Phase 3 clinical study that demonstrated equivalence in efficacy for both primary endpoints. The adjusted treatment differences between groups were within predefined equivalence margins for mean changes from baseline in both best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and in central subfield thickness (CST). The improvements in the primary efficacy outcomes remained stable and appeared comparable between treatment groups at all time points up to week 52.

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) announced today that the company completed submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval of lenacapavir, an investigational, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) people with multi-drug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 infection.

The submission is supported by data from the Phase 2/3 CAPELLA trial, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of lenacapavir administered subcutaneously every six months in combination with an optimized antiretroviral background regimen. Key data on lenacapavir will be presented during the 11th International AIDS Society (IAS) Conference on HIV Science in July 2021.

In May 2019, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the development of lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced patients with multi-drug resistance in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Lenacapavir, which is being studied as an every-six-month subcutaneous injection, is a potential first-in-class capsid inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1 infection without overlapping resistance with any currently approved antiretroviral therapy (ART).

“Lenacapavir is an important breakthrough innovation with the potential to be transformative for people living with multi-drug resistant HIV who have very limited treatment options,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “The filing moves us one step closer to providing an innovative treatment option that helps to address barriers to achieving viral suppression and meet the unmet needs of people living with multi-drug resistant HIV.”

Lenacapavir is being developed in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg with MDR HIV-1 infection who are currently on a failing antiretroviral treatment regimen due to resistance, intolerance or safety considerations. Lenacapavir is designed to inhibit HIV-1 replication by interfering with multiple, essential steps of the viral lifecycle, including capsid-mediated uptake of HIV-1 proviral DNA, virus assembly and release, and capsid core formation.

Gilead plans to submit marketing authorization applications for lenacapavir to the European Medicines Agency and other global agencies in the coming months.

Lenacapavir is an investigational compound and is not approved by any regulatory authority for any use and its safety and efficacy are not established. There is no cure for HIV or AIDS.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CAPELLA (NCT04150068)</span></b>

CAPELLA is a Phase 2/3 double-blinded, placebo-controlled global multicenter study designed to evaluate the antiviral activity of Gilead’s investigational, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor lenacapavir administered every 6 months as a subcutaneous injection in HTE people with MDR HIV-1 infection. CAPELLA includes men and women living with HIV-1 and is being conducted at research centers in North America, Europe and Asia.

In CAPELLA, 36 participants with multi-class HIV-1 drug resistance and a detectable viral load while on a failing regimen were randomly allocated to receive oral lenacapavir or placebo for 14 days, in addition to continuing their failing regimen (functional monotherapy). An additional 36 participants were enrolled in a separate treatment cohort. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants randomly allocated to receive oral lenacapavir or placebo for 14 days, in addition to continuing their failing regimen, achieving = 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL reduction from baseline in HIV-1 RNA at the end of the functional monotherapy period.

The study achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating that a significantly higher proportion of participants randomly allocated to receive lenacapavir achieved a clinically meaningful viral load reduction of at least 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL from baseline compared with those receiving placebo during the 14-day functional monotherapy period (88% vs. 17%, p&lt;0.0001). These data were previously <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gilead.com%2Fnews-and-press%2Fpress-room%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2F3%2Fgileads-investigational-lenacapavir-demonstrates-sustained-long-acting-efficacy-through-week-26-in-data-presented-at-croi&amp;esheet=52452264&amp;newsitemid=20210628005788&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=presented&amp;index=1&amp;md5=37fee9eaafb3702445705cb6826ef039"" rel=""nofollow"">presented</a> at the virtual 28th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (<i>virtual</i> CROI 2021). Those who received lenacapavir (n=24) achieved statistically significantly greater mean decrease in viral load than those who received placebo (n=12) during the functional monotherapy period (-1.93 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL vs. -0.29 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL, p&lt;0.0001). Lenacapavir was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to study drug observed and no study drug discontinuations through the 14-day period, including no discontinuations due to adverse events. The most common adverse events observed were injection site reactions.

Following the 14-day functional monotherapy period, participants who were randomly allocated to receive lenacapavir or placebo, in addition to continuing their failing regimen, started open-label lenacapavir and an optimized background regimen, while those enrolled in a separate treatment cohort received open-label lenacapavir and an optimized background regimen on Day 1. This ongoing maintenance period of the study is evaluating the additional trial endpoints of safety and efficacy of subcutaneous lenacapavir administered every six months in combination with an optimized background regimen. The trial data for the first six-month period (Week 26) have been submitted to the FDA as part of the NDA filing, and will be presented at an upcoming conference.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Lenacapavir</span></b>

Lenacapavir is a potential first-in-class, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor in development for the treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection. Lenacapavir's multi-stage mechanism of action is distinguishable from currently approved classes of antiviral agents and is designed to provide a new avenue for the development of long-acting therapy options for people living with or at risk for HIV-1. While most antivirals act on just one stage of viral replication, lenacapavir is designed to inhibit HIV-1 at multiple stages of its lifecycle and has no known cross resistance to other existing drug classes.

The safety, efficacy and dosing of lenacapavir are being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical studies.

<span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span> and SUZHOU, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 27, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high-quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases today announced that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> has approved the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) as a first-line treatment for people with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is the first regulatory approval of a PD-1 inhibitor-based combination therapy for the first-line treatment for HCC.

This is also the fourth NMPA-approved indication of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) as well as the fourth NMPA-approved indication of BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection). TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) was approved in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin's lymphoma in <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2018</span>, the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in <span class=""xn-chron"">February 2021</span>, and the first-line treatment of squamous NSCLC in <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2021</span>. BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) was previously approved for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, and adult recurrent glioblastoma.

This new approval was based on the results of a randomized, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial (ORIENT-32) of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) as first-line therapy for unresectable HCC. Based on the interim analysis conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by Independent Radiographic Review Committee (IRRC) compared to sorafenib, meeting the pre-defined efficacy criteria. Safety analyses revealed no new safety signals. The ORIENT-32 results were published in <i><a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(21)00252-7/fulltext"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Lancet Oncology</a></i> on <span class=""xn-chron"">June 15, 2021</span>.

Professor <span class=""xn-person"">Fan Jia</span> from Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University stated,"" In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death and ranks fourth in terms of incidence with a five-year survival rate of only 10 percent. Response of hepatocellular carcinoma to chemotherapy and targeted therapy is undesirable, while immunotherapy has emerged as breakthrough treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. The ORIENT-32 has demonstrated that sintilimab plus bevacizumab can extend the overall survival and progression-free survival in this patient population and bring significant clinical benefits. The approval will provide a new option for the first-line treatment of these patients with few systemic options, and also contribute to the 'Healthy China 2030'.""

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Yongjun Liu</span>, President of Innovent, stated: ""Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death globally, and <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> accounts for over 50 percent of all new cases and deaths worldwide. The disease is a serious threat to the life and health of Chinese people and a heavy burden on society and families, with hepatocellular carcinoma accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all liver cancer. We are very pleased that TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) plus BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) – two drugs recognized by the <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> national innovation drug development project – is the first approved PD-1 inhibitor-based combination therapy for the first-line treatment of people with hepatocellular carcinoma. Innovent is proud to continue delivering on our mission of developing high-quality biopharmaceuticals that are affordable to ordinary people, while also contributing to the 'Healthy China 2030' Plan for cancer prevention and treatment.""

<b>About the ORIENT-32 Trial<br class=""dnr"" /></b>ORIENT-32 is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multi-center study conducted in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) compared to sorafenib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma(ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03794440"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03794440</a>). The primary endpoints of the trial were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by Independent Radiographic Review Committee (IRRC) based on RECIST v1.1.

A total of 571 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) plus BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) or sorafenib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The combination therapy showed significant improvements in OS and PFS compared to sorafenib, and safety was consistent with previously reported safety profiles of each drug. The full results of ORIENT-32 were published in <i><a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(21)00252-7/fulltext"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Lancet Oncology</a></i> on <span class=""xn-chron"">June 15, 2021</span>.

<b>About Hepatocellular Carcinoma<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Primary liver cancer(PLC)is a common malignancy of the digestive system worldwide, among which about half of all new cases and deaths occur in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. The main pathological types of liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which accounts for 85 to 90 percent, and a small number of cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma(ICC)and HCC-ICC mixed liver cancer. In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, HCC is primarily caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

<b>About Sintilimab<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Sintilimab, marketed as TYVYT<sup>®</sup> (sintilimab injection) in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, is an innovative PD-1 inhibitor with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Eli Lilly and Company. Sintilimab is an immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1 / PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies of sintilimab to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials.

In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, sintilimab has been approved for four indications, including:
<ul>
 	<li>The treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy</li>
 	<li>In combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
 	<li>In combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
 	<li>In combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) for the first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma</li>
</ul>
Additionally, Innovent currently has a regulatory submission under review in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> for sintilimab for the second-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Innovent also has two clinical studies of sintilimab that have met their primary endpoints:
<ul>
 	<li>In combination with cisplatin plus paclitaxel or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil for the first-line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma</li>
 	<li>The second-line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma</li>
</ul>
In <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2021</span>, the U.S. FDA accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Sintilimab was included in <span class=""xn-location"">China's</span> National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in 2019 as the first PD-1 inhibitor and the only PD-1 included in the list in that year.

<b>About BYVASDA<sup>®</sup> (bevacizumab biosimilar injection)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>BYVASDA<sup>®</sup>, also known as IBI305, is a bevacizumab biosimilar and a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important factor in angiogenesis that is highly expressed by the endothelial cells in most human tumors. An anti-VEGF antibody binds VEGF-A selectively with high affinity and blocks its binding to VEGF-2 receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt/PKB and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK. BYVASDA<sup>®</sup> produces anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the growth, proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, blocking angiogenesis, reducing vascular permeability, blocking blood supply to tumor tissues, inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Since its launch, bevacizumab has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in these tumor types have been well recognized worldwide.

In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) is approved for indications including advanced non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, adult recurrent glioblastoma, and advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

<div class=""rich-text"">

A sub-analysis from the Oxford-led COV001 and COV002 trials with <i>Vaxzevria </i>induced strong immune responses following either a prolonged second dose interval of up to 45 weeks or following a third boosting dose.

The results, published by the University of Oxford on the pre-print server of <i>The Lancet</i>, demonstrated that antibody levels remain elevated from baseline for at least one year following a single dose.

An extended interval between the first and second dose of <i>Vaxzevria </i>of up to 45 weeks, resulted in up to an 18 fold increase in antibody response, measured 28 days after the second dose. With a 45 week dosing interval between the first and second dose, antibody titres were four times higher than with a 12 week interval, demonstrating that a longer dosing interval is not detrimental but can derive stronger immunity.

In addition, a third dose of <i>Vaxzevria</i> given at least 6 months after a second dose, boosted antibody levels six fold and maintained T cell response. A third dose also resulted in higher neutralising activity against the Alpha (B.1.1.7, 'Kent'), Beta (B.1.351, 'South African') and Delta (B.1.617.2, 'Indian') variants.

Both the late second dose and the third dose of <i>Vaxzevria</i> were less reactogenic than the first dose.<b></b>

Professor Sir Andrew J Pollard, chief investigator and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford, said: “This should come as reassuring news to countries with lower supplies of the vaccine, who may be concerned about delays in providing second doses to their populations. There is an excellent response to a second dose, even after a 10 month delay from the first.”

Sir Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “Demonstrating our vaccine generates a robust and durable immune response is important for providing confidence in longer term protection. We look forward to continuing to partner with the University of Oxford and recommending bodies around the world to further evaluate the impact of these data.”

The analysis included volunteers aged 18 to 55 years who were enrolled in COV001 and COV002 trials and had received either a single dose or two doses of <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i>.

<b><i>Vaxzevria</i>, formerly AZD1222</b>

<i>Vaxzevria </i>was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

The vaccine has been granted a conditional marketing authorisation or emergency use in more than 80 countries across six continents, as a two dose regimen given four to 12 weeks apart for adults aged 18 years and over. More than 600 million doses of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca have been supplied to 170 countries worldwide, including more than 100 countries through the COVAX Facility. In the UK, <i>Vaxzevria</i> is known as <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i>.

<b>COV001
</b>COV001 is a single-blinded, randomised, controlled Phase I/II trial to determine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, AZD1222 in up to 1,077 healthy adults in five trial centres in the United Kingdom. Participants aged 18-55 years received either a single dose or two-doses of AZD1222 at 5x10<sup>10</sup> viral particles or a single dose of a meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY as control vaccine.

Participants had blood samples drawn and clinical assessments for safety as well as immunogenicity at day 0, 28 and will also be followed at day 184 and 364. In addition, participants enrolled in the Phase I component of the study and in the two dose groups, had visits at 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after each vaccination.

<b>COV002
</b>COV002 is a single-blinded, multi-centre, randomised, controlled Phase II/III trial assessing the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of AZD1222 in 12,390 participants in the UK. Trial participants were aged 18 years or over, who were healthy or have medically stable chronic diseases and are at increased risk for being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Participants received one or two intramuscular doses of a half dose (~2.5 x10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) or full dose (~5x10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) of AZD1222 or comparator, meningococcal vaccine MenACWY.

Participants had blood samples drawn and clinical assessments for safety as well as immunogenicity at multiple timepoints up to one year post-vaccination. Suspected cases presenting with compatible symptoms were tested for virological confirmation by COVID-19 PCR. In addition, weekly swabbing are done for detection of infection and assessment of vaccine efficacy against infection.

<span class=""xn-location"">DUBLIN</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 28, 2021</span> /PRNewswire<span class=""accessible-message"">(opens new window)</span>/ -- Medtronic plc<span class=""accessible-message"">(opens new window)</span> (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced key clinical data from the virtual 81<sup>st</sup> annual American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions. The presentations illustrated increases in Time in Range when using an InPen™ smart insulin pen, safety of an extended-wear infusion set that lasts up to 7 days, and patient satisfaction with the longer-wear infusion set.

<b><u>InPen Smart Insulin Pen Data
</u></b>Medtronic presented real-world clinical results that compared glycemic outcomes for 1,736 individuals before and after using the InPen smart<sup>1</sup> insulin pen for 90 days with a glucose monitor (CGM). Data showed an increase in Time in Range of 2.3% for people whose glucose management indicator (GMI) was &gt;8% and an increase of 5% Time in Range for people whose GMI was &gt;9.5%. In both groups, people did not experience any increase in Time Below Range<sup>2</sup> (hypoglycemia) during the study period.

Using InPen smart insulin pen also provided improved insulin dosing decision support for those in the study as demonstrated by fewer total doses per day with simultaneously improved glycemic control. The average daily insulin bolus frequency decreased (from 3.7 to 3.6/day and 3.3 to 3.2/day, respectively, for each group) and total rapid acting daily dose of insulin increased (from 26.29 to 27.19 u/day and 27.57 to 29.24 u/day, respectively, for each group). This real-world performance analysis aggregates information from individuals who uploaded their data from <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2018</span> to <span class=""xn-chron"">October 2020</span>. A minimum of 30 days of CGM data pre- and post-InPen start were required to be part of the analysis.

""Smart insulin pens that automatically track insulin doses and calculate active insulin are emerging as important advances in diabetes management technology because they increase the amount of time spent in the preferred glucose range without increasing hypoglycemia,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Anders Carlson</span>, medical director of the Park Nicollet International Diabetes Center (IDC) in <span class=""xn-location"">Minneapolis, Minn.</span> ""It's encouraging to see that positive clinical gains are possible with the use of consumer-friendly diabetes technology, such as InPen, that makes it simple for patients to track insulin dosing, calculate doses and receive reminders and other decision support that allows them to manage their diabetes more effectively without adding a lot of complexity.""

<b><u>Medtronic Extended Infusion Set Data
</u></b>Medtronic also presented U.S. pivotal trial data on the Medtronic Extended infusion set, the first and only infusion set that can be worn for up to seven days. The study evaluated the safety and performance of 259 individuals aged 18 to 80 who wore traditional 2- or 3-day infusion sets with the MiniMed™ 670G system for two weeks followed by twelve consecutive wears of the Medtronic Extended infusion set. The study showed no significant increase in total daily dose of insulin. This indicates that the Medtronic Extended infusion set delivers insulin successfully throughout the seven-day wear of the infusion set. In addition, there were no severe adverse events observed.

During the pivotal study, the same group of patients compared their experience of wearing a 2- or 3-day set to wearing the new 7-day Medtronic extended infusion set. Overall, patients preferred the longer-wear set, rating it higher on ease of insertion, comfort of wear, duration of wear, time required to change infusion set and convenience.

""For decades, insulin infusion sets needed to be changed every two to three days. So, the development of an extended infusion set that can be worn for up to seven days represents a significant improvement in the patient experience,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Bruce Buckingham</span>, M.D., emeritus professor of pediatrics and endocrinology at <span class=""xn-org"">Stanford</span>. ""The pivotal trial demonstrated the safety of the new infusion set as well as increased satisfaction from being able to wear it longer. Alleviating the burden of changing infusion sets every two to three days is a very meaningful improvement in the overall pump experience. This important innovation in the infusion set will make insulin pump therapy feel easier for many patients.""

* In <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>, Medtronic Extended infusion set is limited to investigational use only and not approved for sale, while in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> it is already CE marked.

<b><u>Definitions</u></b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Time in Range</b> - Clinical consensus regarding Time in Range means that a person living with diabetes should be in the recommended range of 70-180 mg/dL (3.9 – 10 mmol/L) for at least 70% of time to be well-controlled. This may increase the likelihood that short and long-term complications of this chronic disease can be avoided.</li>
 	<li><b>Glucose Management Indicator (GMI)</b> – GMI mirrors the A1C level expected based on average glucose measured using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) values.</li>
 	<li><b>InPen </b>- The InPen is the first and only smart insulin pen that's integrated with real-time CGM via one convenient smartphone app. The smart multiple daily injection (MDI) system automatically records insulin doses, tracks active insulin, and recommends mealtime and correction doses. By combining the InPen system with the Guardian™ Connect CGM system, individuals have access to everything they need to manage their diabetes in one place. Rather than switching between apps, users will have the ability to see real-time glucose readings and alerts as well as insulin dose information in real-time, in one view — making it easier to make informed dosing decisions to manage their glucose levels.</li>
 	<li><b>Medtronic Extended Infusion Set </b>- The Medtronic Extended infusion set is the first and only infusion set that can be worn for up to 7 days. The innovative design of the Medtronic Extended infusion set, which is designed and manufactured in collaboration with Unomedical, leverages advanced materials that help reduce insulin preservative loss and maintains insulin flow and stability.</li>

<p align=""justify"">A new study of Soliqua (insulin glargine 100 Units/mL and lixisenatide, iGlarLixi) met its two primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints in a head-to-head comparison against premixed insulin (biphasic insulin aspart 30, BIAsp 30) in adults living with type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, uncontrolled on insulin and one or two oral anti-diabetic medicines. The findings were presented today at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 81<sup>st</sup> Scientific Sessions<sup>1</sup> and simultaneously published in Diabetes Care.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p align=""justify"">The study met both primary endpoints with Soliqua demonstrating noninferiority of blood sugar (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) reduction and superiority on body weight change from baseline compared to premixed insulin. The study also met its key secondary endpoints with Soliqua achieving a greater proportion of people reaching a HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of &lt;7% without weight gain, a greater proportion of people reaching a HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of &lt;7% without weight gain and without hypoglycemia, and superiority in reduction of HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared with those using premixed insulin.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“Concerns about hypoglycemia and weight gain are </em><em>known </em><em>barriers</em><em> when advancing </em><em>basal </em><em>insulin therapy</em><em>,</em><em> especially with complex insulin regimens</em><em>,” </em>says Julio Rosenstock, Director of the Dallas Diabetes Research Center at Medical City, Dallas, TX, and main author of the study.<em> “These results </em><em>show </em><em>improved outcomes with iGlarLixi over </em><em>BIAsp 30</em><em>, demonstrating </em><em>better glucose </em><em>control without body weight gain</em><em> and </em><em>less</em><em> hypoglycemia.</em><em> This </em><em>combined benefit </em><em>could help</em><em> clinicians</em> <em>consider</em><em> advancing</em><em> basal insulin therapy by switching to a </em><em>once-daily </em><em>fixed-ratio combination </em><em>of basal insulin plus a GLP-1 receptor agonist rather than switching to a twice-daily premixed insulin regimen</em><em>.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">A secondary analysis also found study participants using Soliqua reported greater improvements in patient-reported outcomes compared to premixed insulin as measured by Treatment-Related Impact Measure Diabetes (TRIM-D) and patient- and physician-rated Global Treatment Effectiveness Evaluation (GTEE) scores.<sup>3</sup> These tools include measurements of treatment burden, daily life, diabetes management, compliance, psychological health, and treatment effectiveness.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“While premix</em><em>ed</em><em> is used by around </em><em>4</em><em>0% of people </em><em>taking </em><em>insulin</em><em> globally</em><em> to manage their type 2 diabetes today, recent real-world evidence suggests </em><em>only 18.2% of people </em><em>using it reach their blood sugar goal,</em><em>”</em><sup><em>4</em></sup><sup><em>,5</em></sup> said Sandra Silvestri, M.D., Ph.D., Global Medical Head of General Medicines at Sanofi. “<em>Today’s result</em><em>s</em><em> provide further information on </em><em>Soliqua’s </em><em>impact and patient</em><em>-reported outcomes </em><em>that could be considered by </em><em>healthcare providers</em><em> in regions such as India, China, the Middle East and North Africa, where premix is widely used.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">Safety findings were in line with the established profiles of Soliqua and premixed insulin.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the SoliMix study</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The SoliMix study was a 26-week, randomized controlled trial of 887 adults living with type 2 diabetes who were uncontrolled on insulin plus metformin with or without a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i). The study compared the efficacy and safety of Soliqua compared to a commonly used premixed insulin (BIAsp 30). Participants were randomized to switch from their prior insulin to either Soliqua once daily or premixed insulin twice daily, with starting doses determined and adjusted weekly. Any metformin or SGLT-2i treatment was maintained through the study period.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The study met its two primary endpoints and all three of its key secondary endpoints.</p>

<span class=""xn-location"">DUBLIN</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 29, 2021</span> /PRNewswire<span class=""accessible-message"">(opens new window)</span>/ -- Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced the initiation of the DEFINE AFib study, the company's first app-based research study. Using data collected from the LINQ family of insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs), the study aims to address unanswered questions around atrial fibrillation (AF) burden and its impact on patient outcomes, quality of life, and healthcare utilization. The first patients in the study were enrolled at <span class=""xn-org"">Duke University</span> Medical Center in <span class=""xn-location"">Durham, N.C.</span>, by <span class=""xn-person"">Jonathan Paul Piccini</span>, M.D., MHS, FHRS, director of Cardiac Electrophysiology and associate professor of medicine at <span class=""xn-org"">Duke University</span> School of Medicine, and at Florida Electrophysiology Associates in <span class=""xn-location"">Atlantis, Fla.</span>, by <span class=""xn-person"">Robert S. Fishel</span>, M.D., founder of the practice and director of Electrophysiology at JFK Medical Center.

DEFINE AFib will be conducted remotely through the new Medtronic Discovery App™ in coordination with U.S. sites that collectively will enroll approximately 5,000 patients. Study participants will include patients age 22 or older who have a history of AF, an iPhone device (iOS version 13 or higher), and one of the LINQ family of ICMs, among other criteria. The study will incorporate both device data and patient-reported data derived from scheduled patient surveys and the HealthKit — coupled with electronic health record information about medications and previous cardiac procedures — to provide comprehensive, actionable insights. Through a machine learning approach, aggregated study data will be leveraged to enable improved AF management in the future.

""When it comes to managing atrial fibrillation, there is not a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, and the hope is that DEFINE AFib may give us the tools to help personalize AF management based on a patient's individual health profile and physiology,"" said Dr. Piccini, who is also chair of the DEFINE AFib Steering Committee. ""DEFINE AFib will harness the power of digital health to make fundamental discoveries about how we can manage atrial fibrillation better in each and every one of our patients.""

Medtronic developed the app using the ResearchKit framework, given Apple's commitment to privacy and user-friendly experience. The app design leveraged insights from more than 100 hours of patient interviews to simplify and customize patient enrollment, data collection, and communication processes. Extensive app functionality will allow researchers to conduct DEFINE AFib and future large, integrated Medtronic studies remotely, with less site implementation burden.

""Traditional, in-person clinical studies are critically important to deepen our understanding of how to manage chronic conditions like AF but can place a lot of demands on the patients and physicians involved,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Julie Brewer</span>, president of the Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Services business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""A fully app-based study design, with sophisticated data aggregation capabilities and remote monitoring using the LINQ family of ICMs, enables us to conduct DEFINE AFib without in-person patient enrollment or follow-up. This first-of-its-kind trial paves the way for future app-based studies at Medtronic.""

<i>Approval based on Phase 2 CheckMate -142 trial results showing nearly two-thirds of patients responded to the </i>Opdivo <i>plus</i> Yervoy <i>combination with durable responses observed</i>

Opdivo <i>plus</i> Yervoy <i>is the first dual immunotherapy regimen approved in the European Union for colorectal cancer</i>

Opdivo <i>plus</i> Yervoy-<i>based combinations now indicated in the European Union for five different advanced cancer types: mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer</i>

</div>
<span class=""bw-dateline-wrapper"">PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span>Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved <i>Opdivo </i>(nivolumab) plus <i>Yervoy (</i>ipilimumab) for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy. The EC’s decision is based on results from the Phase 2 CheckMate -142 trial in which <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy </i>demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in objective response rate (ORR) in patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC who received prior treatment with fluoropyridine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. The safety profile for <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> was consistent with previous studies of the combination in other tumor types.

“Metastatic colorectal cancer is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis, leaving patients with a critical need for additional treatment options beyond standard chemotherapy,” said Ian M. Waxman, M.D., development lead, gastrointestinal cancers, Bristol Myers Squibb. “With this approval, patients in the EU with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer will now have the first dual immunotherapy treatment available to them, and we look forward to working with stakeholders to advance this rational combination.”

The combination of <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy </i>is the first approved dual immunotherapy treatment option for any GI tumor in the European Union (EU). This combination is also approved in the EU for non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. The Marketing Authorization approves use of <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy </i>in all EU member states, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

CheckMate -142 included a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label cohort investigating <i>Opdivo </i>plus<i> Yervoy</i> in patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability–high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) whose disease had progressed during or after prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy.

In this combination cohort, patients received <i>Opdivo </i>3 mg/kg with <i>Yervoy</i> 1 mg/kg every three weeks for four doses, followed by <i>Opdivo</i> 3 mg/kg as a single agent every two weeks until disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy outcome measures included objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) and duration of response (DOR).

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About dMMR or MSI-H Colorectal Cancer</span></b>

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is cancer that develops in the colon or the rectum, which are part of the body’s digestive or gastrointestinal system. Globally, CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. In 2020, it is estimated that there were approximately 1,931,000 new cases of the disease and that it will be the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women combined.

Mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) occurs when the proteins that repair mismatch errors in DNA replication are missing or non-functional, leading to microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. Approximately 5% of metastatic CRC patients have dMMR or MSI-H tumors. Patients with these biomarkers are less likely to benefit from conventional chemotherapy and typically have a poor prognosis.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

Some ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada–like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients.

In MPM patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO or YERVOY. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.

Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About Upadacitinib (RINVOQ<sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup>)</b>

Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.<sup class=""first-child"">7-14</sup> In human cellular assays, RINVOQ preferentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2.<sup>7</sup> In August 2019, RINVOQ received U.S. FDA approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. RINVOQ is approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs); for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs; and for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. The approved dose for RINVOQ is 15 mg. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis are ongoing.<sup class=""last-child"">9-14</sup> Use of RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis is not approved and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by regulatory authorities.

(NYSE: AMRX) (“Amneal” or the “Company”) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for Bevacizumab, pursuant to Section 351(k) pathway of the Public Health Service Act, and with a standard review goal date in the second quarter of 2022 according to the BsUFA (Biosimilar User Fee Act).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The biosimilar was developed in collaboration with mAbxience, a Spain-based biotechnology company. Bevacizumab is the biosimilar version of Avastin<sup>®</sup> and when approved will be marketed under the proprietary name Alymsys<sup>TM</sup>. Alymsys was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in February 2021. Amneal and mAbxience believe that the data supports the biosimilarity of its Alymsys<sup>TM </sup>product to Avastin<sup>®</sup>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The FDA’s acceptance of our BLA for Bevacizumab is a significant milestone in our journey to become an important player in biosimilars,” stated Chirag and Chintu Patel, Co-Chief Executive Officers. As previously announced, the Company expects its initial biosimilar portfolio will include Filgrastim (biosimilar for Neupogen<sup>®</sup>), Pegfilgrastim (biosimilar for Neulasta<sup>®</sup>) and Bevacizumab (biosimilar for Avastin<sup>®</sup>).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bevacizumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor. Amneal is seeking approval for Bevacizumab for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, in combination with intravenous fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for first- or second-line treatment and metastatic colorectal cancer, in combination with fluoropyrimidine-irinotecan- or fluoropyrimidine-oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for second-line treatment in patients who have progressed on a first line Alymsys-containing regimen. Amneal also intends to seek approval for the remainder of the indications from the reference product label as soon as possible, subject to patent and regulatory exclusivities, by the biosimilarity pathway pursuant to Section 351(k).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to IQVIA™, a leading healthcare data and analytics provider, U.S. annual sales for Bevacizumab for the 12 months ended April 2021 were approximately $2.8 billion.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","London, 10th June 2021:  Theramex, a leading global speciality pharmaceutical company dedicated to women and their health, announced that it has entered into an agreement to register and commercialise denosumab from Enzene Biosciences Limited, Pune, India, for use in Europe, the UK, Switzerland, and Australia. Denosumab, a biosimilar of the reference medicine Prolia ®, is an antiresorptive treatment for osteoporosis with sales in these markets of close to €1 billion9 in 2020.  Enzene will exclusively supply the finished product to Theramex for the duration of the agreement.

Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that targets and binds with high affinity and specificity to RANKL, preventing activation of its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption in cortical and trabecular bone. Denosumab is administered by a single subcutaneous injection once every six months.

Robert Stewart, Chief Executive Officer at Theramex said, “The addition of this biosimilar to our existing portfolio continues our strategic determination to improve access and affordability of important treatments to patients. The care and good management of bone health is critical to Theramex. From our recently launched Vitamin D small gel capsule that is easy to take, to our a gastric resistant third-generation bisphosphonate that allows patients to take their medication with or without food, and our cost-efficient teriparatide biosimilar with an easy to use pre-filled syringe, we are helping to improve the quality of life for women.”

Himanshu Gadgil, Whole-Time Director at Enzene said, “Enzene is dedicated to the development of affordable treatment options for patients. As such, I am delighted that Enzene and Theramex will be working together to provide women in Europe, the UK, Switzerland, and Australia with access to denosumab, a biosimilar treatment for osteoporosis.”

Notes to Editor: About osteoporosis

Osteoporosis remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated, resulting in a large number of fractures.

It is a significant health issue – affecting ~200 million people worldwide2
Osteoporosis affects more women than men and risk increases with age3
After the menopause women start to lose bone at a faster rate, raising the risk for women who have had an early menopause or hysterectomy3
One in three women aged over 50 will suffer a fragility fracture4
Up to a third of patients treated with bisphosphonates (one in three) take their bisphosphonate with food, which may increase fracture risk1
Hip, spine and wrist fractures are the most common fractures, which have a debilitating impact on daily activities and quality of life4
After a spine fracture mortality decreased over a 5-year period by up to 16% per year5
Vertebral fractures can lead to back pain, loss of height, deformity, immobility, QoL, and activities of daily living6,7,8

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","TORONTO, June 7, 2021 /CNW/ – Celltrion Healthcare Canada Limited announced today the launch of Remsima™ SC (CT-P13 SC), the world’s first subcutaneous formulation of infliximab in Canada for the treatment of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Health Canada granted a notice of compliance (NOC) for Remsima™ SC in Canada for the treatment of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on January 28.1

“We are delighted to be able to launch Remsima™ SC today and to bring the first and only subcutaneous form of infliximab to patients, payers and clinicians in Canada,” said Jovan Antunovic, Commercial Director at Celltrion Healthcare Canada. “Our team is strong, growing and proud that Remsima™ SC will be the first product to be commercially available in the Canadian market under our new direct sales marketing strategy and is supported by the comprehensive CELLTRION CONNECT™ patient support program. We will continue to enhance our presence in Canada by collaborating with the different stakeholders to support the company’s growth strategy.”

Remsima™ SC is commercially available in Canada in 120 mg fixed dose as a pre-filled pen (auto-injector) and is administered as a bi-weekly subcutaneous injection. It is approved in Canada for use in combination with methotrexate for the reduction in signs and symptoms, inhibition of the progression of structural damage and improvement in physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and should be used as maintenance therapy after the completion of an induction period with intravenous infliximab.2

“Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that can lead to irreparable joint destruction if not properly treated,” said Professor Edward Keystone, Professor of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. “Having a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab means patients can have a more flexible dosing schedule and control on how they receive their treatment.”

The approval was based on clinical evidence including results from a study that showed switching people with RA from the intravenous (IV) formulation to the SC formulation of CT-P13 treatment at Week 30 was comparable to maintaining CT-P13 SC up to Week 54 (up to Week 64 for safety profile).2,3

About CELLTRION CONNECT™ Patient Support Program

CELLTRION CONNECT™ patient support program is designed to support patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers with access to Remsima™ SC. Interested individuals can find out more about CELLTRION CONNECT™ by visiting www.celltrionconnect.ca/

About CT-P13 (biosimilar infliximab)4, 5, 6

CT-P13 is developed and manufactured by Celltrion, Inc. and was the world’s first monoclonal antibody biosimilar approved by the European Commission (EC). It is indicated for the treatment of eight autoimmune diseases including RA and IBD. It was approved by the EC under the trade name Remsima® in September 2013 and launched in major EU countries in early 2015. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved CT-P13 in April 2016 under the trade name Inflectra®. CT-P13 is approved in more than 94 countries (as of June 2021) including the US, Canada, Japan and throughout Europe.

CT-P13 IV is usually given as 3 mg per kg/body weight in RA and as 5 mg per kg/body weight for the other indications. Infliximab IV is given as an infusion over two hours. All patients are monitored for any reactions during the infusion and for at least one to two hours afterwards. The subcutaneous (SC) formulation has the potential to enhance treatment options for the use of infliximab biosimilar by providing high consistency in drug exposure and a convenient method of administration.

CT-P13 SC has received EU marketing authorization for the treatment of people with RA and IBD in November 2019 and July 2020, respectively.

<p align=""justify"">MENDHAM, N.J. and WARMINSTER, Pa., June 29, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Antios Therapeutics, Inc. and Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS) today announced that the companies have entered into a clinical collaboration agreement to evaluate a triple combination of Arbutus’ proprietary GalNAc delivered RNAi therapeutic, AB-729, Antios’ proprietary active site polymerase inhibitor nucleotide (ASPIN), ATI-2173, and Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), for the treatment of subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.</p>
<p align=""justify"">ATI-2173, AB-729 and Viread will be evaluated in combination in a single cohort in the ongoing Antios Phase 2a ANTT201 clinical trial. The multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose cohort will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and antiviral activity of the combination of ATI-2173, AB-729 and Viread. This cohort is expected to initiate in the second half of 2021. Antios will be responsible for the costs of adding this single cohort to its ongoing clinical trial. Arbutus will be responsible for the manufacture and supply of AB-729.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“This collaboration with Antios advances our efforts to position AB-729 as a potential cornerstone therapeutic in future HBV combination regimens and reflects our conviction that a combination of agents with complementary mechanisms of action is needed to cure chronic HBV,” stated William Collier, Chief Executive Officer at Arbutus.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Greg Mayes, Chief Executive Officer of Antios said, “ATI-2173 has, to date, demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile and sustained on- and off-treatment antiviral responses as a monotherapy in patients with chronic HBV. We believe that its unique mechanism of action and early evidence of clinical activity may position ATI-2173 as the backbone of a once-daily curative regimen in combination with other agents for chronic HBV. Our collaboration with Arbutus will test that hypothesis in combination with AB-729, an RNAi drug candidate, and Viread, a nucleotide analogue.”</p>
<strong><u>About the Combination Clinical Trial Cohort</u></strong>
<p align=""justify"">The combination clinical trial cohort will include 10 subjects with chronic HBV infection assigned 8:2 to active drug (ATI-2173+AB-729) or matching placebos. The active drug (ATI-2173+AB-729) or placebo will be administered in combination with 300 mg of Viread (equivalent to 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). ATI-2173 and Viread will be administered once a day for 90 days. AB-729 will be administered by subcutaneous injection at Day 28 and Day 90. Following this 90 day treatment period, subjects will be followed-up for safety and sustained antiviral responses for 6 additional months.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Any subjects whose HBV DNA remains below the limit of quantification (BLQ) at 6 months of follow-up will have HBV DNA and virology samples collected every 3 months off therapy until a detectable HBV DNA level is confirmed, or until 18 months after the 6 months of follow-up, whichever comes first.</p>
<strong><u>About AB-729</u></strong>
<p align=""justify"">AB-729 is an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic targeted to hepatocytes using Arbutus’ novel covalently conjugated N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) delivery technology that enables subcutaneous delivery. AB-729 inhibits viral replication and reduces all HBV antigens, including hepatitis B surface antigen in preclinical models. Reducing hepatitis B surface antigen is thought to be a key prerequisite to enable reawakening of a patient’s immune system to respond to the virus. Based upon clinical data generated thus far in an ongoing single- and multi-dose Phase 1a/1b clinical trial, AB-729 has demonstrated positive safety and tolerability data and meaningful reductions in hepatitis B surface antigen.</p>
<strong><u>About ATI-2173</u></strong>
<p align=""justify"">ATI-2173 is a novel, orally-administered, liver-targeted Active Site Polymerase Inhibitor Nucleotide (ASPIN) molecule designed to deliver the 5’-monophosphate of clevudine to the liver. This L-nucleoside’s active 5’-triphosphate has unique antiviral properties as a non-competitive, non-chain terminating HBV polymerase inhibitor that distorts the active site of HBV polymerase resulting in potent HBV antiviral activity and extended off-treatment suppression of HBV DNA. ATI-2173 targets the liver, delivering high levels of the unique 5’- triphosphate while limiting systemic exposure to the parent L-nucleoside. ATI-2173 has the potential to become an integral part of a curative combination regimen for chronic hepatitis B.</p>
<strong><u>About HBV</u></strong>
<p align=""justify"">Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by HBV. HBV can cause chronic infection which leads to a higher risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection (CHB) represents a significant unmet medical need. The World Health Organization estimates that over 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, while other estimates indicate that approximately 2 million people in the United States suffer from chronic HBV infection. Approximately 900,000 people die every year from complications related to chronic HBV infection despite the availability of effective vaccines and current treatment options.</p>
<strong><u>About Arbutus</u></strong>
<p align=""justify"">Arbutus Biopharma Corporation is a publicly traded (Nasdaq: ABUS) biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on discovering, developing and commercializing a cure for people with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The Company is advancing multiple product candidates with distinct mechanisms of action that it believes have the potential to provide a new curative regimen for chronic HBV infection.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-49959"" src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Press-Release.png"" alt="""" width=""969"" height=""519"" />REYKJAVÍK, Iceland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alvotech, today, announced reaching the primary completion date in the switching study for AVT02, the company’s proposed interchangeable biosimilar to Humira®. The purpose of the switching study (AVT02-GL-302) is to support the approval of AVT02 in the U.S. as an interchangeable biosimilar product with the high concentration (100mg/mL) dosage forms of Humira®. Alvotech is the only known company that has both developed a biosimilar candidate for the high-concentration Humira® and is executing a switching study to support approval as an interchangeable product. Top-line results from the switching study are expected later this year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“Once such medications are FDA approved and available in the United States, they may be substituted at the pharmacy without the intervention of the health care professional who prescribed it, much like how generic drugs already are routinely substituted for brand name drugs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For 2020, AbbVie reported global revenues for Humira® of nearly $20bn, of which more than $16bn came from the U.S. market. Today, over 80% of the usage of Humira® in the U.S. uses the high concentration form.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The completion of the comparative treatment phase of the switching study is a key milestone in our program for our AVT02 interchangeable biosimilar candidate. Achieving interchangeability in the U.S. is a cornerstone in our development strategy and consistent with our commitment to patients,” said <b>Alvotech CEO, Mark Levick.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Our differentiated offering can provide consumers and taxpayers a long sought after and more affordable, accessible alternative to Humira by more rapidly converting the existing market. By developing a high-concentration interchangeable product, we can save U.S. Consumers and tax payers billions annually,” said <b>Alvotech Chairman, Róbert Wessman.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In November of 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency accepted Alvotech’s regulatory submissions for AVT02. A decision from the FDA regarding the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for AVT02 is expected in September of 2021 and an EMA decision for the AVT02 European Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In May 2021, Alvotech USA Inc. filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Virginia seeking to invalidate four of AbbVie’s key patents. The lawsuit also argues that AbbVie’s patent strategy, which has been under recent <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04453137%3Fterm%3DAVT02%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D5&amp;esheet=52445547&amp;newsitemid=20210615005879&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Congressional+scrutiny&amp;index=1&amp;md5=add17f7dee88cc9137bed1ec8d6c9617"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" shape=""rect"">Congressional scrutiny</a>, renders its Humira® patents unenforceable. Further, the lawsuit points out that AbbVie has failed to sue Alvotech’s US affiliate (the actual BLA applicant) at all. At stake are billions of dollars of cost to the U.S. healthcare system, negatively impacting consumers and taxpayers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>About Interchangeability</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The FDA describes biosimilar interchangeability as follows: “Once such medications are FDA approved and available in the United States, they may be substituted at the pharmacy without the intervention of the health care professional who prescribed it, much like how generic drugs already are routinely substituted for brand name drugs.”<sup>1</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The concept of interchangeability for biosimilars was signed into law through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) in 2010. In order to be considered interchangeable, a biosimilar must meet additional requirements, including the execution of an interchangeable “switching study”, utilizing the innovator and biosimilar product in patients. The vast majority of states have passed laws regarding substitution for interchangeable biosimilars.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>About AVT02-GL-302</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">AVT02-GL0302 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate PK, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity between patients receiving Humira and patients undergoing repeated switches between Humira and AVT02, followed by an optional safety Extension Phase. The study is composed of 3 phases: (1.) a lead-in phase, where all patients receive Humira; (2.) a switching phase, where one cohort receive Humira and one cohort switches between AVT02 and Humira; and (3.) an optional open-label extension phase, where all patients receive AVT02. The study enrolled 568 participants. The primary completion date occurs at the end of the second phase (at week 28), in which the last participant is examined to collect final data for the primary outcome measures.</p>

<strong>Halle (Saale) / Munich, Germany and Nanjing, China, June 29, 2021</strong> – Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon) a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines and Simcere Pharmaceutical Group Ltd (HKEX: 2096) (Simcere) today announced that they have entered into a strategic regional licensing partnership to develop and commercialize medicines targeting the neurotoxic amyloid species N3pE (pGlu-Abeta) to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in Greater China.

<span class=""has-inline-color has-white-color"">.</span>

The agreement grants Simcere a regional license to develop and commercialize varoglutamstat (PQ912), Vivoryon’s Phase 2b-stage N3pE amyloid-targeting oral small molecule glutaminyl cyclase (QPCT) inhibitor with disease-modifying potential for AD, as well as the Company’s preclinical monoclonal N3pE-antibody PBD-C06 in the Greater China region.

<span class=""has-inline-color has-white-color"">.</span>

QPCT is an enzyme responsible for the formation of N3pE amyloid, a neurotoxic molecule that is not found in healthy individuals and has been identified as a driver of AD pathology. N3pE amyloid is not only implicated in Abeta peptides aggregating into plaques which are widely observed in AD patients, but also has a negative impact on other pathologies that underly the disease, including tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and impairment of synaptic function. By inhibiting QPCT and thus preventing the formation of toxic N3pE amyloid, varoglutamstat acts very early in disease pathogenesis and thereby has the potential to prevent neuronal damage.

<span class=""has-inline-color has-white-color"">.</span>

Vivoryon’s monoclonal N3pE-antibody PBD-C06 is specifically designed to bind to and remove neurotoxic N3pE amyloid from the brain and has been optimized with respect to low immunogenicity and low potency to induce amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), a major side effect in antibody-based AD therapies.

<span class=""has-inline-color has-white-color"">.</span>

Under the terms of the agreement, Vivoryon will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and will also be eligible for payments upon achievement of certain development and sales milestones, with all components amounting to a total of over US$565 M. In addition, Vivoryon will receive double-digit royalties on sales. Further financial details were not disclosed.

<span class=""has-inline-color has-white-color"">.</span>

Pursuant to the agreement, Simcere will be responsible for clinical development of varoglutamstat in patients with early AD in China. The clinical development program in Greater China is intended to be complementary to Vivoryon’s efforts in Europe and the US including Vivoryon’s ongoing European VIVIAD Phase 2b trial as well as the Company’s planned Phase 2a/b study in the US, which is anticipated to start in the second half of this year. Simcere has also acquired an option to advance PBD-C06, an antibody that specifically targets N3pE amyloid, towards clinical development.

<span class=""has-inline-color has-white-color"">.</span>

“This regional partnership represents an important milestone on our journey to bringing novel therapeutic options to as many patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease as possible,” commented Michael Schaeffer, PhD, Vivoryon’s Chief Business Officer. “With prevalence rising in China, AD is already a heavy burden on patients, families and the country’s healthcare system. In partnering with Simcere, who is continuously recognized as one of the top innovative pharmaceutical and manufacturing enterprises in China, we hope to be able to make an impact beyond our own focus of developing varoglutamstat towards the markets in Europe and the US.”

<span class=""has-inline-color has-white-color"">.</span>

“We are extremely pleased to have entered into this agreement with Vivoryon to leverage the potential of innovative N3pE amyloid-targeting agents to treat Alzheimer’s disease in Greater China,” added Kevin Oliver, PhD, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Business Development at Simcere. “Both partners are clearly committed to delivering meaningful therapies to AD patients in need, in line with Simcere’s mission of providing today’s patients with medicines of the future.”

<strong>About varoglutamstat (PQ912)</strong>

Varoglutamstat is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of glutaminyl cyclase (QPCT), an enzyme which catalyzes the formation of N3pE amyloid, a particularly neurotoxic molecule not found in healthy individuals that has been identified as a driver of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). N3pE amyloid triggers a number of pathological processes in AD, including the formation of toxic soluble Abeta oligomers, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and impairment of synaptic function. By preventing formation of this toxic molecule, varoglutamstat acts very early in disease pathogenesis and thus has the potential to prevent neuronal damage. Varoglutamstat is currently in Phase 2 clinical development.

<span class=""has-inline-color has-white-color"">.</span>

<strong>About </strong><strong>PBD-C06</strong>

PBD-C06 is a preclinical stage humanized and de-immunized IgG1 antibody specifically designed to bind to and remove neurotoxic N3pE amyloid from the brain. The antibody is optimized with respect to low immunogenicity and low potency to induce amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), which represent the major severe side effects of antibody-based AD therapies.

<strong>• Investment round led by Korean-based Mirae Asset Capital and                   </strong><strong>Celltrion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Newcastle, UK, 7 June 2021: Iksuda Therapeutics (Iksuda), the developer of a new generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) with raised therapeutic index, today announced it has completed a US $47 million (circa GB £34 million) financing round, co-led by Mirae Asset Capital and its subsidiaries, Celltrion and Premier Partners, with the Company being advised by Ashfords LLP. The funding will support the advancement of Iksuda’s lead ADC assets and expansion of its payload and conjugation platform technologies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Iksuda’s lead pre-clinical candidate, IKS03, is a best-in-class CD19-targeted ADC candidate for B-cell cancers. The investment will enable progression of IKS03 to first-in-human phase 1 clinical trials. It will also be used to accelerate the Company’s earlier-stage programmes including IKS04 and IKS012 to IND filing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Iksuda’s ADC programmes target tumours that currently have limited treatment options and high relapse rates. The Company’s drug development pipeline is centred on the improved safety and efficacy conferred by tumour activated, prodrug payloads in combination with stable conjugation technologies, including its proprietary novel PermaLink<sup class=""u-rtm"">®</sup> platform. Iksuda’s research-stage pipeline utilizes its proprietary Protein Alkylating (ProAlk) tumour-activated payload platform, recently licensed from Göttingen University1. The novel mode of action for the ProAlk tuneable payload series differs from the field’s primary focus of intra- or DNA inter-strand cross-linking, conferring benefits against drug and tumour resistance mechanisms, and enabling the development of more powerful, more tolerable ADCs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dr Dave Simpson, Chief Executive Officer, Iksuda Therapeutics, said: “This is a transformational investment milestone for Iksuda, enabling us to focus on the progression of our industry-leading ADC programmes and bring them to the clinic, whilst supporting our commercial growth. The funding not only reflects the potential of our technologies, but also the unmatched expertise of the Iksuda team. We are grateful for the support of this group of investors and delighted to welcome them to the team.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ji Kwang Chung, Investor, Mirae Asset Capital, commented: “We have been highly impressed with Iksuda’s approach and progress to date, and with the Company’s leadership. We are delighted to lead this investment round, and to contribute to enabling the team to progress its very promising pipeline of ADC candidates.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Woosung, Kee, CEO, Celltrion Inc., added: “By pursuing tumours that are resistant to current treatment approaches, Iksuda is extending the boundaries of ADC technology, and consequently the treatment options for patients. This ideally complements Celltrion’s drive to pioneer uncharted areas of innovative therapies, incorporating unique and successful next-generational approaches that promote health and welfare globally. We have been very impressed with Iksuda’s progress to date and look forward to working together to support their mission.”</p>

<strong>About Formycon:
</strong>Formycon is a leading, independent developer of high-quality biopharmaceutical medicines, especially biosimilars. The company focuses on treatments in ophthalmology, immunology and on other key chronic diseases, covering the entire value chain from technical development to the clinical phase III as well as the preparation of dossiers for marketing approval. With its biosimilars, Formycon is making a major contribution towards providing as many patients as possible with access to vital and affordable medicines. Formycon currently has four biosimilars in development. Based on its extensive experience in the development of biopharmaceutical drugs, the company is also working on the development of a COVID-19 fusion protein.

<strong>About Biosimilars:
</strong>Since their introduction in the 1980s, biopharmaceuticals have revolutionized the treatment of serious diseases such as cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and eye diseases. In the coming years, many of these biotech drugs will lose their patent protection – and by 2020, medications with revenues of approximately USD 100 billion will be off patent. Biosimilars are follow-on versions of biopharmaceuticals, for which exclusivity has expired. They are approved via stringent regulatory pathways in highly regulated markets (such as EU, US, Japan, Canada, Australia) based on proven similarity of the biosimilar with the originator biopharmaceutical reference product. In 2019, global sales of biosimilars exceeded USD12 billion. Analysts estimate that this figure could rise to around USD 69 billion by 2025.

WALTHAM, Mass. and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 30, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: APLS) and Beam Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: BEAM) today announced an exclusive five-year research collaboration focused on the use of Beam’s proprietary base editing technology to discover new treatments for complement-driven diseases. The companies will collaborate on six research programs focused on C3 and other complement targets in the eye, liver, and brain.

“Beam has pioneered base editing, which holds significant promise as a best-in-class technology for precision gene editing. This collaboration builds on our deep scientific expertise in complement and, together with our growing pipeline, positions Apellis for long-term leadership in the complement field,” said Cedric Francois, M.D., Ph.D., co-founder and chief executive officer, Apellis. “Apellis and Beam share a vision for advancing transformative medicines for patients, which is critically important as we embark on a highly innovative effort to modulate complement and discover new treatments across a wide range of debilitating diseases.”

Base editing represents a potential new class of precision genetic medicine that uses a chemical reaction designed to create precise, predictable, and efficient single base changes at targeted genomic sequences without making double-stranded breaks in the DNA. Editing key elements of the complement pathway in target organs has the potential to alter the complement cascade and durably address diseases driven by abnormal complement activity.

“Apellis has established itself as a leader in complement with the advancement of compelling targeted C3 therapies,” said John Evans, chief executive officer, Beam. “This collaboration allows us to combine our proprietary technologies and capabilities in base editing with Apellis’ expertise in targeting the complement pathway to develop new medicines for diseases driven by complement biology. This also represents an important strategic initiative to explore opportunities that expand the application of base editing to address more biologically complex diseases for patients in need of new treatment options.”

Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Beam will apply its base editing technology and conduct preclinical research on up to six base editing programs that target specific genes within the complement system in various organs, including the eye, liver, and brain. Apellis will have exclusive rights to license each of the six programs and will assume responsibility for subsequent development. Beam may elect to enter a 50-50 U.S. co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Apellis with respect to one program licensed under the collaboration.

As part of the collaboration, Beam will receive a total of $75 million in upfront and near-term milestones from Apellis – $50 million upon signing and an additional $25 million payment on the one-year anniversary of the contract execution date. After exercise of the opt-in license rights for each of the up to six programs, Beam will be eligible to receive development, regulatory, and sales milestones from Apellis, as well as royalty payments on sales. The collaboration has an initial term of five years and may be extended up to two years on a per year and program-by-program basis.

<strong>Bad Vilbel</strong><strong>, 29 June 2021</strong> – STADA and its biosimilar development partner Xbrane Biopharma have announced that their ranibizumab biosimilar candidate met its primary endpoint in a pivotal comparability trial involving 583 patients. On the basis of these six-month interim results from the Phase III-type ‘Xplore’ clinical trial, the two partners anticipate submitting a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to European Medicines Agency (EMA) and a Biologics License Application (BLA) to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the second half of 2021.

In the randomized, double-masked, multi-center study, the ranibizumab biosimilar candidate met the primary endpoint demonstrating equivalent efficacy in BCVA (Best Corrected Visual Acuity) at Week 8 of treatment compared to the reference biologic, Lucentis<sup>®</sup>. Furthermore, the interim analysis of six-month data demonstrated that the biosimilar has similar pharmacokinetic, safety and immunogenicity profile compared to Lucentis<sup>®</sup>, a VEGF-a inhibitor used in treatment of serious eye diseases, mainly wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME)<a href=""https://www.stada.com/blog/posts/2021/june/stada-and-partner-xbrane-advance-biosimilar-ranibizumab-candidate#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>.
Under the terms of a co-development agreement entered into in July 2018 for a biosimilar of Lucentis®, STADA and Xbrane will equally contribute to development expenses and share profits from commercialization. STADA will hold any granted marketing authorizations and will be responsible for sales and marketing of the product in Europe. Bausch + Lomb, the commercialization partner of STADA and Xbrane, will be responsible for marketing the ranibizumab biosimilar in North America. STADA and Xbrane are currently evaluating commercialization options, including regional partnerships, for the rest of the world.<em> </em>

“We welcome this important step towards bringing a high-quality, cost-effective treatment option to ophthalmologists and their patients,” commented Bryan Kim, STADA’s Global Head of Specialties.  “With ranibizumab, STADA’s growing biosimilars presence would extend beyond oncology, nephrology, osteoporosis and autoimmune indications into the multi-billion-euro eyecare market. We look forward to continuing to work closely with our partner Xbrane on applying for regulatory approval of our biosimilar candidate in major markets.”

“Ranibizumab represents a key opportunity in STADA’s extensive biosimilars pipeline covering major disease areas such as ophthalmology, oncology and autoimmune conditions through our go-to-partner strategy,” STADA CEO Peter Goldschmidt pointed out. “Becoming a leading European supplier of biosimilars this decade will play an essential role in our roadmap for Specialty Pharmaceuticals, one of three strategic pillars for STADA alongside Generics and Consumer Healthcare.”

<p align=""left"">NEW YORK, June 30, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LEXEO Therapeutics, a clinical-stage gene therapy company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation and Orphan Drug designation to LX2006 for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia (FA). LX2006 is an IV-administered, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy encoding the human frataxin gene. The designations granted to LX2006 cover cardiac disease and broader symptoms associated with FA.</p>
The FDA grants Rare Pediatric Disease designation for serious and life-threatening diseases that primarily affect children ages 18 years or younger and fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. If a biologics license application (BLA) for LX2006 is approved, LEXEO may be eligible to receive a priority review voucher that may be sold or transferred.

The Orphan Drug designation is granted by the FDA to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Programs with Orphan Drug status are eligible for various development incentives.

“Being granted both Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designation shows the tremendous urgency for new, impactful therapeutic approaches such as LX2006 for people diagnosed with Friedreich’s ataxia,” said R. Nolan Townsend, Chief Executive Officer of LEXEO Therapeutics. “It is critical that we advance new disease-modifying therapies with the potential to transform the lives of FA patients, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with the FDA as we advance LX2006 through clinical development.”

FA is a rare, degenerative, multi-system disorder affecting approximately one in 50,000 people in the United States. It is an inherited condition caused by a gene mutation that disrupts the normal production of the protein frataxin, which functions in the mitochondria of the cell. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, usually beginning in childhood and leads to impaired muscle coordination (ataxia) that worsens over time, typically progressing to serious heart conditions that can lead to heart failure, which is the most common cause of death in FA patients.

LEXEO plans to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial of LX2006 in patients with cardiomyopathy associated with FA in 2021.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., June 30, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced its XIENCE family of stents has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for one-month (as short as 28 days) DAPT labeling for high bleeding risk (HBR) patients in the U.S. In addition, XIENCE stents recently received CE Mark approval for DAPT as short as 28 days – giving XIENCE stents the shortest DAPT indication in the world.

In addition to the HBR indication, Abbott has also received FDA approval and European CE Mark approval for its next-generation XIENCE Skypoint stent. XIENCE Skypoint is easier to place and allows physicians to treat larger blood vessels through improved stent expansion that can open clogged vessels more effectively.

“The new FDA approval for DAPT for the XIENCE family of stents provides interventional cardiologists confidence they are delivering the best care to patients with high bleeding risk.  A short DAPT duration minimizes risks for high bleeding risk patients and allows them to return to daily life sooner and with more assurance,” says Roxana Mehran, M.D., professor of medicine and director of Interventional Cardiovascular Research and Clinical Trials at the Zena and Michael A. Wiener Cardiovascular Institute at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the global principal investigator for Abbott’s Short DAPT program (XIENCE 28 and XIENCE 90).

Stents are a critical therapy option to open blood vessels that have been clogged by calcium or fatty deposits. Following stent implantation, DAPT is routinely prescribed to help prevent clotting (thrombosis), which can block a blood vessel and potentially result in heart attack or death. However, DAPT can also increase the risk of bleeding complications in some patients.2 In fact, of all patients undergoing stenting procedures, approximately one in five are considered at high risk for bleeding.3

Patients who receive stents are typically on DAPT regimens (aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors) for six to 12 months to prevent blood clots from blocking the stented vessel. However, HBR patients can experience side effects such as bleeding during prolonged courses of DAPT. With the shortest approved DAPT labeling, Abbott’s XIENCE stents can help physicians treat their HBR patients more effectively. Abbott’s XIENCE 28 and XIENCE 904 studies show that DAPT can be safely discontinued early as short as 28 days with no increased risk in patient adverse events, solidifying the industry-leading safety profile of the XIENCE family of stents.

XIENCE SKYPOINT: INNOVATION FOR OPTIMAL PATIENT CARE
XIENCE Skypoint, the latest in a line of trusted XIENCE stents, is now approved for use in HBR patients with one-month DAPT labeling – as short as 28 days – in the U.S. and in Europe. Supported by 10 years of clinical data, including 120 clinical trials studying 125,000 patients and the implantation of 15 million stents, XIENCE drug-eluting stents (DES) have been proven safe and effective, consistently delivering successful patient outcomes.

“Even small differences between stents can impact both short- and long-term patient outcomes, and this latest generation of the XIENCE stent offers multiple improvements that provide enhanced deliverability and expansion capability,” said Nick West, M.D., chief medical officer and divisional vice president of global medical affairs at Abbott’s vascular business. “As we continue to innovate at Abbott, we are delivering medical technology that improves patients’ lives, while building a body of research evidence that underlines clinical consistency and patient safety.”

<span class=""xn-location"">DUBLIN</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 30, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Rylaze<sup>™</sup> (asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant)-rywn) for use as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) in pediatric and adult patients one month and older who have developed hypersensitivity to <i>E. coli</i>-derived asparaginase.<sup>1</sup> <i>Rylaze</i> is the only recombinant erwinia asparaginase manufactured product that maintains a clinically meaningful level of asparaginase activity throughout the entire duration of treatment, and it was developed by Jazz to address the needs of patients and healthcare providers with an innovative, high-quality erwinia-derived asparaginase with reliable supply.
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

""We are excited to bring this important new treatment to patients who are in critical need, and we are grateful to FDA for the approval of <i>Rylaze</i> based on its established safety and efficacy profile. We are pleased <i>Rylaze</i> was approved before the trial is complete and are diligently working to advance additional clinical trial data. We are committed to quickly engaging with FDA to evolve the <i>Rylaze</i> product profile with additional dosing options and an IV route of administration,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Bruce Cozadd</span>, chairman and CEO of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. ""Thank you to our collaborators within the Children's Oncology Group, the clinical trial investigators, patients and their families, and all of the other stakeholders who helped us achieve this significant milestone.""

</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

<i>Rylaze</i> was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of ALL/LBL by FDA in <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2021</span>. The Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) approval followed review under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program, an initiative of FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence designed for efficient delivery of safe and effective cancer treatments to patients.

The company expects <i>Rylaze</i> will be commercially available in mid-July.

""The accelerated development and approval of <i>Rylaze</i> marks an important step in bringing a meaningful new treatment option for many ALL patients – most of whom are children – who cannot tolerate <i>E. coli</i>-derived asparaginase medicine,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Luke Maese</span>, assistant professor at the <span class=""xn-org"">University of Utah</span>, Primary Children's Hospital and Huntsman Cancer Institute. ""Before the approval of <i>Rylaze, </i>there was a significant need for an effective asparaginase medicine that would allow patients to start and complete their prescribed treatment program with confidence in supply.""

Recent data from a Children's Oncology Group retrospective analysis of over 8,000 patients found that patients who did not receive a full course of asparaginase treatment due to associated toxicity had significantly lower survival outcomes – regardless of whether those patients were high risk or standard risk, slow early responders.<sup>2</sup>

<b>About Study JZP458-201<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The FDA approval of <i>Rylaze</i>, also known as JZP458, is based on clinical data from an ongoing pivotal Phase 2/3 single-arm, open-label, multicenter, dose confirmation study evaluating pediatric and adult patients with ALL or LBL who have had an allergic reaction to <i>E. coli</i>-derived asparaginases and have not previously received asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi. The study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of JZP458. The determination of efficacy was measured by serum asparaginase activity (SAA) levels. The Phase 2/3 study is being conducted in two parts. The first part is investigating the intramuscular (IM) route of administration, including a Monday-Wednesday-Friday dosing schedule. The second part remains active to further confirm the dose and schedule for the intravenous (IV) route of administration.

The FDA approval of <i>Rylaze</i> was based on data from the first of three IM cohorts, which demonstrated the achievement and maintenance of nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) greater than or equal to the level of 0.1 U/mL at 48 hours using IM doses of <i>Rylaze</i> 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The results of modeling and simulations showed that for a dosage of 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> administered intramuscularly every 48 hours, the proportion of patients maintaining NSAA = 0.1 U/mL at 48 hours after a dose of <i>Rylaze</i> was 93.6% (95% CI: 92.6%, 94.6%).<sup>1</sup>

The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;15%) were abnormal liver test, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, infection, headache, pyrexia, drug hypersensitivity, febrile neutropenia, decreased appetite, stomatitis, bleeding and hyperglycemia. In patients treated with the <i>Rylaze</i>, a fatal adverse reaction (infection) occurred in one patient and serious adverse reactions occurred in 55% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (in =5% of patients) were febrile neutropenia, dehydration, pyrexia, stomatitis, diarrhea, drug hypersensitivity, infection, nausea and viral infection. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 9% of patients who received <i>Rylaze</i>. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation included hypersensitivity (6%) and infection (3%).<sup>1</sup>

The company will continue to work with FDA and plans to submit additional data from a completed cohort of patients evaluating 25mg/m<sup>2</sup> IM given on Monday and Wednesday, and 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given on Friday in support of a M/W/F dosing schedule. Part 2 of the study is evaluating IV administration and is ongoing. The company also plans to submit these data for presentation at a future medical meeting.

<b><u>Investor Webcast<br class=""dnr"" /></u></b>The company will host an investor webcast on the <i>Rylaze</i> approval in July. Details will be announced separately.

BOSTON, LONDON and LEIDEN, The Netherlands, July 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orchard Therapeutics (Nasdaq: ORTX), a global gene therapy leader, and Pharming Group N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR), a global, commercial stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced a strategic collaboration to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize OTL-105, a newly disclosed investigational <em>ex vivo</em> autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE), a life-threatening rare disorder that causes recurring swelling attacks in the face, throat, extremities and abdomen.

OTL-105 is an investigational HSC gene therapy designed to increase C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) in HAE patient serum to prevent hereditary angioedema attacks. OTL-105 inserts one or more functional copies of the SERPING1 gene into patients own HSCs <em>ex vivo</em> which are then transplanted back into the patient for potential durable C1-INH production. In preclinical studies, to date, OTL-105 demonstrated high levels of SERPING1 gene expression via lentiviral-mediated transduction in multiple cell lines and primary human CD34+ HSCs. Furthermore, the program achieved production of functional C1-INH protein, as measured by a clinically validated assay.

Under the terms of the collaboration, Pharming has been granted worldwide rights to OTL-105 and will be responsible for clinical development, regulatory filings, and commercialization of the investigational gene therapy, including associated costs. Orchard will lead the completion of IND-enabling activities and oversee manufacturing of OTL-105 during pre-clinical and clinical development, which will be funded by Pharming. In addition, both companies will explore the application of non-toxic conditioning regimen for use with OTL-105 administration.

Orchard will receive an upfront payment of $17.5 million comprising $10 million in cash and a $7.5 million equity investment from Pharming at a premium to Orchard's recent share price. Orchard is also eligible to receive up to $189.5 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones as well as mid-single to low double-digit royalty payments on future worldwide sales.

“Given the combination of our expertise in HSC gene therapy with Pharming’s long-standing legacy and experience, we have the potential to reinvent the treatment paradigm for HAE by providing people living with this life-threatening disorder a sustained therapy with a single administration,” said Bobby Gaspar, M.D., Ph.D., chief executive officer of Orchard Therapeutics. “This collaboration demonstrates the promise of the HSC gene therapy platform and how it can be applied to new therapeutic areas with larger patient populations. We believe the HSC gene therapy pipeline we are building could continue to be a source of future partnerships in areas where the biology supports our approach.”

“Pharming has been committed to the HAE community for more than two decades,” said Sijmen de Vries M.D., MBA, chief executive officer of Pharming. “We have partnered with Orchard Therapeutics, a leader in the development of autologous HSC gene therapy, to develop a potentially curative treatment for HAE. Based on Pharming’s experience in HAE, we believe that HSC gene therapy has the potential for the highest probability of success. This confidence is based on the durability of effect and safety observed in approved treatments from Orchard’s HSC gene therapy portfolio and positive clinical data in several other programs. This a significant first step in developing a potentially transformative one-time treatment for HAE.”

“Great progress has been made in HAE treatment over the last 15 years. However, HAE remains a severe, debilitating disease with an ongoing burden of angioedema attacks or chronic medication use,” said Dr. Marc Riedl, professor of medicine and clinical director of the U.S. Hereditary Angioedema Association Center at the University of California, San Diego. “This promising work toward treatment with the potential for durable long-term clinical benefit is encouraging and signifies an ongoing commitment to the HAE community. I look forward to these efforts to identify and carefully advance a potential cure for HAE.”

The HAE market is expected to generate ~$2 billion in sales in 2021, currently growing at 8% per annum. This represents a significant commercial opportunity for Pharming Group and Orchard Therapeutics.

<strong>About HAE</strong>
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder. The condition is caused by a deficiency of the C1 esterase inhibitor protein, which is normally present in blood and helps control inflammation (swelling) and parts of the immune system. Deficient C1 inhibitor does not adequately perform its regulatory function and, as a result, a biochemical imbalance can occur and produce unwanted peptides that induce the capillaries to release fluids into surrounding tissue, thereby causing swelling or edema.

HAE is characterized by spontaneous and recurrent episodes of swelling (edema attacks) of the skin in different parts of the body, as well as in the airways and internal organs. Edema of the skin usually affects the extremities, the face, and the genitals. Patients suffering from this kind of edema often withdraw from their social lives because of the disfiguration, discomfort and pain these symptoms may cause. Almost all HAE patients suffer from bouts of severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea caused by swelling of the intestinal wall.

Edema of the throat, nose or tongue is particularly dangerous and potentially life-threatening as it can lead to obstruction of the airway passages. Although there is currently no known cure for HAE, it is possible to treat the symptoms associated with angioedema attacks. HAE affects about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. Experts believe a lot of patients are still seeking the right diagnosis: although HAE is (in principle) easy to diagnose, it is frequently identified very late or not discovered at all. The reason HAE is often misdiagnosed is because the symptoms are similar to those of many other common conditions such as allergies or appendicitis. By the time it is diagnosed correctly, the patient has often been through a long ordeal.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; LAUSANNE, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Seres Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MCRB), a leading microbiome therapeutics company, announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Nestlé Health Science to jointly commercialize SER-109, Seres’ investigational oral microbiome therapeutic for recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile </i>infection<i> </i>(CDI), in the United States (U.S.) and Canada. If approved, SER-109 would become the first-ever FDA-approved microbiome therapeutic.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Under the terms of the agreement, Nestlé Health Science will utilize its global pharmaceutical business Aimmune Therapeutics and will assume the role of lead commercialization party. Seres will receive license payments of $175 million up front, and an additional $125 million upon FDA approval of SER-109. The agreement also includes sales target milestones which, if achieved, could total up to $225 million. Seres will be responsible for development and pre-commercialization costs in the U.S. Upon commercialization, Seres will be entitled to an amount equal to 50% of the commercial profits.

The agreement to co-commercialize SER-109 in the U.S. and Canada represents the expansion of an existing strategic collaboration between the companies. Nestlé Health Science already has commercial rights to Seres’ investigational treatments for CDI and inflammatory bowel disease outside of the U.S. and Canada, and with this expansion, Nestlé Health Science becomes Seres’ global collaborator in SER-109.

A leading cause of hospital-acquired infections in the U.S., CDI is associated with debilitating diarrhea and claims the lives of more than 20,000 Americans each year. SER-109 is comprised of purified Firmicutes spores, based on their modulatory role in the life cycle of<i> C. difficile</i> and disease pathogenesis. The bacterial consortium in SER-109 rapidly repopulates the microbiome in the gut to produce compositional and functional changes that are critical to a sustained clinical response.

“Nestlé Health Science has been a terrific collaborator in our quest to develop a new treatment option for patients suffering from recurrent <i>C. difficile</i> infection, and their support over the past few years has been critical in advancing SER-109 to address this unmet need,” Seres Therapeutics CEO, Eric Shaff, said. ""We conducted a competitive process to select a collaborator for SER-109. As we prepare for potential approval and commercialization, we are eager to embark side-by-side on our next phase with a company that believes as fervently as we do in the potential of this transformative approach to reduce the recurrence of CDI.”

“We are excited to expand our existing collaboration with Seres Therapeutics at this pivotal time, given the promise SER-109 holds for patients trapped in the debilitating cycle of recurrent <i>C. difficile</i> infection,” CEO of Nestlé Health Science, Greg Behar, added. “Nestlé Health Science is focused on the fast-developing areas of gut health, food allergies and metabolic health within our global pharmaceutical business, Aimmune Therapeutics. We look forward to leveraging Aimmune’s existing, fully integrated commercial infrastructure and capability to launch this important medicine, once approved.”

Nestlé Health Science continues to make significant investments in innovation while leveraging leading-edge science. Its pharma arm, Aimmune Therapeutics, has a strong presence in the field of gastroenterology, allowing it to lead the commercialization of SER-109 while providing Seres the ability to retain a strategic role and actively participate in the launch.

<span class=""bwuline"">SER-109 Clinical &amp; Regulatory Milestones</span>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>In August 2020, Seres announced that SER-109 had met the primary endpoint from the pivotal Phase 3 ECOSPOR III study, showing a highly statistically significant reduction in the rate of CDI recurrence compared to placebo at 8 weeks, with an absolute reduction of 27% and a relative risk reduction of 68%. In a separate measure, approximately 88% of patients achieved sustained clinical response at week 8.</li>
 	<li>The Company expects that the ECOSPOR III efficacy results should support a BLA filing as a single pivotal trial once the SER-109 safety database includes at least 300 treated subjects monitored for 24 weeks, based on feedback from the FDA.</li>
 	<li>A SER-109 open-label study is ongoing and continues to contribute to the SER-109 safety database. Completion of target enrollment is anticipated in Q3 of 2021.</li>
</ul>
Responsibility for oversight of activities to support SER-109 will be governed by a Joint Steering Committee composed of an equal number of members from each company. Seres is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of SER-109 for all geographies contemplated in the collaboration in addition to ex-North America. Seres will lead medical affairs activities pre-launch and Aimmune Therapeutics will lead commercialization and medical affairs activities post-launch.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Foundation Medicine, Inc. today announced that it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for FoundationOne CDx to be used as a companion diagnostic for ALUNBRIG® (brigatinib), which is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an FDA-approved test. FoundationOne CDx, the only FDA-approved tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) test, is now able to detect ALK+ mNSCLC and identify patients who may be appropriate for treatment with ALUNBRIG which is approved as a first-line or later-line therapy.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for 85 percent of the estimated 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed globally each year. 1 2 Approximately three to five percent of patients with NSCLC have a rearrangement in the ALK gene.3

“This approval reinforces the importance of comprehensive genomic profiling in patient care and confirms its value in guiding treatment decisions at diagnosis of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer,” said Brian Alexander, M.D., M.P.H., chief executive officer at Foundation Medicine. “We’re proud to partner with Takeda to ensure patients with this serious condition have access to this important treatment option.”

FoundationOne CDx, which now has 28 companion diagnostic claims, is the first and only FDA-approved tissue-based broad companion diagnostic that is clinically and analytically validated for solid tumors. This latest approval reinforces FoundationOne CDx’s ability to detect ALK rearrangements, which can be missed with alternate testing methods.

“It’s exciting to see continued advancement in personalizing medicine,” said Gina Hollenbeck, President of ALK Positive. “As a non-small cell lung cancer patient myself who has experienced brain metastases, I know how important it can be to find the right treatment at the right time, especially in the first line.”

Foundation Medicine and Takeda entered into an agreement to develop companion diagnostics for therapies in its late-stage lung portfolio in September 2020.

“We are excited by the approval of FoundationOne CDx as a companion diagnostic for ALUNBRIG, an important milestone in the diagnosis and treatment of people living with ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer,” said Dion Warren, head, U.S. Oncology Business Unit, Takeda. “The approval of FoundationOne CDx to inform treatment with ALUNBRIG is the first of three companion diagnostics in development as part of our ongoing partnership between Foundation Medicine and Takeda aimed at addressing the urgent need for broad access to genomic tests, and expanding treatment options for people with lung cancer.”

ALUNBRIG is a potent and selective next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that was designed to target ALK molecular alterations. ALUNBRIG is approved in the U.S., European Union (EU) and Japan as a first-line treatment for patients with ALK+ mNSCLC previously not treated with an ALK inhibitor. ALUNBRIG is also approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Canada and the EU, for the treatment of people living with ALK+ mNSCLC who have taken the medicine crizotinib, but their NSCLC has worsened or they cannot tolerate taking crizotinib.

About FoundationOne CDx

FoundationOne CDx is a next-generation sequencing based in vitro diagnostic device for detection of substitutions, insertion and deletion alterations (indels), and copy number alterations (CNAs) in 324 genes and select gene rearrangements, as well as genomic signatures including microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue specimens. FoundationOne CDx is for prescription use only and is intended as a companion diagnostic to identify patients who may benefit from treatment with certain targeted therapies in accordance with their approved therapeutic product labeling. Additionally, FoundationOne CDx is intended to provide tumor mutation profiling to be used by qualified health care professionals in accordance with professional guidelines in oncology for patients with solid malignant neoplasms. Use of the test does not guarantee a patient will be matched to a treatment. A negative result does not rule out the presence of an alteration. Some patients may require a biopsy.

Ahmedabad, July 1, 2021
Zydus Cadila today announced that the company has applied for Emergency Use Authorization
(EUA) to the office of Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for ZyCoV-D - its Plasmid
DNA Vaccine against COVID-19. The company conducted the largest clinical trial for its
COVID-19 vaccine in India so far in over 50 centers. This was also the first time that any
COVID-19 vaccine has been tested in adolescent population in the 12-18 years age group in
India. Around 1000 subjects were enrolled in this age group and the vaccine was found to be
safe and very well tolerated. The tolerability profile was similar to that seen in the adult
population. Primary efficacy of 66.6% has been attained for symptomatic RT-PCR positive
cases in the interim analysis. Whereas, no moderate case of COVID-19 disease was observed
in the vaccine arm post administration of the third dose suggesting 100% efficacy for moderate
disease. No severe cases or deaths due to COVID-19 occurred in the vaccine arm after
administration of the second dose of the vaccine.
ZyCoV-D had already exhibited a robust immunogenicity and tolerability and safety profile in
the adaptive Phase I/II clinical trials carried out earlier. Both the Phase I/II and Phase III clinical
trials have been monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).
The plug and play technology on which the plasmid DNA platform is based is ideally suited
for dealing with COVID-19 as it can be easily adapted to deal with mutations in the virus, such
as those already occurring.
Speaking on the development, Dr. Sharvil Patel, Managing Director, Cadila Healthcare Ltd.,
said, “This breakthrough marks a key milestone in scientific innovation and advancement in
technology. As the first ever plasmid DNA vaccine for human use, ZyCoV-D has proven its
safety and efficacy profile in our fight against COVID-19. The vaccine when approved will
help not only adults but also adolescents in the 12 to 18 years age group. This has been possible
because of the collective support of the Government, the regulators, the volunteers who had
faith in the process, the investigators who conducted the multi-centric trials all through these
months, the suppliers who worked closely with us and our dedicated team of researchers and
vaccine professionals who worked tirelessly on the vaccine and also manufactured the trial
doses.”
In another development, the Company has also evaluated a two dose regimen for ZyCoV-D
vaccine using a 3 mg dose per visit and the immunogenicity results had been found to be
equivalent to the current three dose regimen. This will further help in reducing the full course
duration of vaccination while maintaining the high safety profile of the vaccine in the future.
Zydus acknowledges the support of National Biopharma Mission, BIRAC, Department of
Biotechnology, Govt of India, National Institute of Virology, Indian Council of Medical
Research and PharmaJet® in the development of ZyCoV-D vaccine.
About ZyCoV-D
ZyCoV-D is a plasmid DNA vaccine which when injected produces the spike protein of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus and elicits an immune response mediated by the cellular and humoral arms
of the human immune system, which play a vital role in protection from disease as well as viral
clearance.
What differentiates ZyCoV-D?
? ZyCoV-D is a three dose, intradermal vaccine, which is applied using The PharmaJet®
needle free system, Tropis®, can also lead to a significant reduction in any kind of side
effects.
? ZyCoV-D is stored at 2-8
oC but has shown good stability at temperatures of 25oC for
at least three months. The thermostability of the vaccine will help in easy transportation
and storage of the vaccine and reduce any cold chain breakdown challenges leading
vaccine wastage.
? The plasmid DNA platform provides ease of manufacturing with minimal biosafety
requirements (BSL-1).
? Also being a plasmid DNA vaccine, ZyCoV-D doesn’t have any problem associated
with vector based immunity.
? The Plasmid DNA platform also allows generating new constructs quickly to deal with
mutations in the virus, such as those already occurring.
Zydus’ Vaccine research programme
Vaccine Technology Centre of Zydus Cadila has wide range of capabilities in
developing and manufacturing viral, toxoid, polysaccharide, conjugate and other
subunit vaccines for unmet needs. In fact, Zydus was the first company in India to
develop and indigenously manufacture the vaccine to combat Swine Flu during the
pandemic in 2010. In past, it has also indigenously developed numerous vaccines
successfully including tetravalent seasonal influenza vaccine (first company in India to
indigenously develop and commercialize), Inactivated Rabies vaccine (WHO
Prequalified), Varicella vaccine (first Indian company to indigenously develop and
receive market authorization), Measles containing vaccines (MR, MMR, Measles),
Typhoid conjugate vaccine, pentavalent vaccine (DPT-HepB-Hib) etc to name a few.
The company also has a strong pipeline of vaccines like Measles-Mumps-RubellaVaricella (MMRV), Human papillomavirus vaccine, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis E vaccines
which are at various stages of development.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zydus_cadila-1.jpg,COVID-19|Regulatory,Zydus ,ZyCoV-D ,COVID-19|Regulatory|EUA|India,publish,02-07-2021,2

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","SAN DIEGO, July 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Denovo Biopharma LLC, a pioneer in applying precision medicine to develop innovative therapies, today announced it has licensed global rights for idalopirdine from H. Lundbeck A/S, including all rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize idalopirdine for all indications. Lundbeck received options to re-acquire idalopirdine for predetermined undisclosed financial terms, with Denovo and Lundbeck sharing China rights in the event Lundbeck’s options are exercised and Denovo retaining all global rights in the event Lundbeck’s options are not exercised.  Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

Idalopirdine (now DB109) is an oral antagonist of the serotonin (5-HT6) receptor, which is primarily expressed in the brain and is hypothesized to be involved in Alzheimer’s Disease, schizophrenia, and other indications.  DB109 has been extensively evaluated in numerous clinical studies encompassing more than 2500 subjects.  Although Phase 3 trial results were negative, subsets of patients who showed signs of beneficial activity of DB109 were identified.  Despite the recent approval of aducanumab, Alzheimer’s Disease remains one of the toughest diseases to conquer as countless drug have failed to demonstrate efficacy.   While precision medicine has proved to vital to the many breakthroughs in oncology drug development in the last decade, the lack of pharmacogenomic biomarkers could be one of the main reasons of these failures in Alzheimer’s Disease. Denovo plans to use its unique biomarker platform to search for pharmacogenomic predictors of DB109’s efficacy.

“Alzheimer’s Disease remains an area of significant unmet need in neurological disease, and the rich idalopirdine data set that has been generated permits Denovo to fully leverage its experience in novel biomarker discovery to potentially identify patients for which idalopirdine may have benefit,” said Michael F. Haller, Ph.D., Denovo’s Chief Business Officer. “Denovo discovered the first known genetic biomarker for drug efficacy in a CNS disorder, for our DB104 asset in treatment-resistant depression, and we hope to have similar success for DB109.”

“We are excited to collaborate with Denovo Biopharma and build upon the efforts of our employees, investigators, and patients who participated in our clinical trials to potentially develop a personalized medicine for Alzheimer’s Disease,” said Keld Flintholm Jørgensen, CBO at Lundbeck.

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date assigned by the FDA for this NDA is April 30, 2022.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Surufatinib received fast track designation in April 2020 for the treatment of pancreatic and extra-pancreatic NET. Orphan Drug Designation for pancreatic NET was also granted in November 2019.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Dr. Marek Kania, Managing Director and Chief Medical Officer of HUTCHMED International Corporation, said: “This NDA filing acceptance of surufatinib in the U.S. is a significant achievement for HUTCHMED as we expand our global operations and work to bring our innovative oncology drugs to cancer patients worldwide. The FDA’s acceptance of the NDA highlights the clinical value of this submission package and the importance of bringing more treatment options to US NET patients.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">The NDA is supported by data from two positive Phase III studies of surufatinib in patients with pancreatic and extra-pancreatic NET in China (SANET-p<sup>1</sup> and SANET-ep<sup>2</sup> both previously reported in <em>The Lancet Oncology</em>), and a surufatinib study conducted in the U.S.<sup>3</sup> The data package will also be used to file a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) imminently, based on <a title=""scientific advice"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=gs7tZyhtYnhoLjhZSx4PTHdK60fau1D0G9-dCFPaEzmGOfGEcU_DELwvuL4WyVtZtBuV0fcMUEMGQTXSHoxNnHJuPb1yAfhTFD7ta1oxaDoQeSe9C2PtF0IH4tPsPITYRNEbqFmLqpBx7CLwut-OlQ=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">scientific advice</a> from the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About NETs</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">NETs form in cells that interact with the nervous system or in glands that produce hormones. They can originate in various parts of the body, most often in the gut or the lungs and can be benign or malignant. NETs are typically classified as pancreatic NET (“pNET”) or extra-pancreatic NET (“epNET”).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">According to Frost &amp; Sullivan, there were 19,000 newly diagnosed cases of NET in the U.S. in 2020. Importantly, NETs are associated with a relatively long duration of survival compared to other tumors. As a result, there were approximately 143,000 estimated patients living with NET in the U.S. in 2020.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About Surufatinib</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Surufatinib is a novel, oral angio-immuno kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity associated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), which both inhibit angiogenesis, and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which regulates tumor-associated macrophages, promoting the body’s immune response against tumor cells. Its unique dual mechanism of action may be very suitable for possible combinations with other immunotherapies, where there may be synergistic anti-tumor effects.</p>

GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Alector (Nasdaq: ALEC), today announced a strategic global collaboration for the development and commercialisation of two clinical-stage, potential first-in-class monoclonal antibodies (AL001 and AL101) designed to elevate progranulin (PGRN) levels. PGRN is a key regulator of immune activity in the brain with genetic links to multiple neurodegenerative disorders, making it one of the most attractive genetically validated targets for the development of new immuno-neurology treatments.

The collaboration brings together Alector’s leading immuno-neurology expertise with GSK’s R&amp;D focus on the science of the immune system and human genetics, proven late-stage drug development capabilities and global footprint. Enrolment is currently underway for a pivotal Phase 3 trial for AL001 in people at risk for or with frontotemporal dementia due to a progranulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN). FTD-GRN is a rapidly progressing and severe form of dementia found most frequently in people less than 65 years old at the time of diagnosis and has no approved treatments. AL001 is also currently in a Phase 2 study in symptomatic FTD patients with a mutation in the C9orf72 gene and is planned to enter Phase 2 development for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the second half of 2021. AL101 is in a Phase 1a clinical trial and is designed to treat patients suffering from more prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

<strong>Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&amp;D, GSK, said:</strong> “Our focus on human genetics and the science of the immune system gives us unique insights into the potential of targets such as progranulin to help patients with a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Working with Alector’s world class scientists will allow us to investigate the potential of these immuno-neurology therapies to help patients with frontotemporal dementia, a devastating disease without any currently approved treatments, as well as explore the ability to help patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.”

<strong>Arnon Rosenthal, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, Alector, said: </strong>“This transformative collaboration brings together Alector’s leading immuno-neurology expertise with GSK’s commitment to immunology and human genetics, proven drug development capabilities and global footprint, to help expand and accelerate the development of our progranulin franchise into large indications, while bolstering the build out of our own late-stage development and commercial capabilities. Importantly, this collaboration is designed to fully support AL001 and AL101’s development and to enable Alector to continue building a fully integrated company as we strive to address the high unmet medical need in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. We are confident that GSK’s extensive experience launching ground-breaking medicines at the intersection of immunology and human genetics, will ensure that AL001 and AL101 are developed to their full potential.”

As part of the recent Investor Update day on 23 June 2021, GSK committed to an R&amp;D approach focused on maximising opportunities by leveraging an increased understanding of the science of the immune system and human genetics. The collaboration with Alector on AL001 and AL101, two antibodies designed to elevate PGRN levels and potentially slow the progression of FTD and other neurological disorders, provides GSK access to a promising clinical programme in immuno-neurology.

<strong>Terms of the Collaboration
</strong>Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Alector will receive $700 million in upfront payments. In addition, Alector will be eligible to receive up to an additional $1.5 billion in clinical development, regulatory and commercial launch-related milestone payments.

Alector will lead the global clinical development of AL001 and AL101 through Phase 2 proof-of-concept. Thereafter, Alector and GSK will share development responsibilities for all late-stage clinical studies for AL001 and AL101 and all costs for global development will be divided between the two companies.

The companies will be jointly responsible for commercialisation in the U.S. and will share profits and losses. Alector will lead commercial efforts associated with AL001 in orphan indications and GSK will lead the commercialisation of AL101 in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Outside the U.S., GSK will be responsible for commercialisation of AL001 and AL101 and Alector will be eligible for tiered royalties.

The collaboration agreement is conditional upon customary conditions including review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

<strong>About the Progranulin-Elevating Monoclonal Antibodies - AL001 and AL101
</strong>Decreased levels of PGRN, a key regulator of immune response, lysosomal function, and neuronal survival in the brain, are genetically linked to many neurodegenerative disorders. AL001 and AL101 are novel human monoclonal antibodies that elevate levels of progranulin by blocking the sortilin receptor responsible for progranulin degradation. AL001 is currently in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study in people at risk for or with frontotemporal dementia due to a progranulin gene mutation (FTD-GRN). AL001 is also currently in a Phase 2 study in symptomatic FTD patients with a C9orf72 mutation, with another Phase 2 study in patients with ALS planned to begin in the second half of 2021. AL101, is designed to treat people suffering from more prevalent neurodegenerative diseases and is currently in a Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers. AL101 is intended to be developed for treatment of Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

<strong>About Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)
</strong>Frontotemporal dementia is a rapidly progressing and severe form of dementia. It affects 50,000 to 60,000 people in the United States and roughly 110,000 in the European Union, with potentially higher prevalence in Asia and Latin America. There are currently no FDA-approved treatment options for FTD.

There are multiple heritable forms of FTD. In one form, FTD-GRN, people have a mutation in the progranulin gene. This population represents 5% to 10% of all people with FTD. Mutations in a single copy of a progranulin gene leads to a 50% or greater decrease in the level of progranulin protein and invariably leads to development of FTD. In another form, people with mutations in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene can develop FTD. FTD-C9orf72 is associated with abnormal accumulation of the protein TDP-43, which is also a hallmark in FTD-GRN. To date researchers have identified more than 120 inherited loss of function mutations in the progranulin gene that lead to FTD.

Basel, 02 July 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that new data from its haemophilia A clinical programme will be presented at the virtual International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) 2021 Congress, from 17-21 July 2021. Data will include the final analysis from the phase IIIb STASEY study of Hemlibra® (emicizumab) and updated data from the phase I/II study of SPK-8011, an AAV-based gene therapy in development by Spark Therapeutics (a member of the Roche Group).<sup>1,2</sup>

“We’re excited to present new data from our haemophilia A programme at the ISTH 2021 Congress,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “These data reinforce our continued commitment to developing transformational therapies for the haemophilia A community and advancing understanding of the long-term efficacy and safety profile of Hemlibra.”

Haemophilia A is a serious, inherited bleeding disorder in which a person’s blood doesn't clot properly, as they either lack or do not have enough of a clotting protein called factor VIII. This can lead to uncontrolled bleeding, either spontaneously or after minor trauma. These bleeds can present a significant health concern as they often cause pain and can lead to chronic swelling, deformity, reduced mobility, and long-term joint damage.<sup>3</sup> The development of factor VIII inhibitors can be a significant challenge in the treatment of people with haemophilia A as they bind to and block the efficacy of replacement factor VIII.<sup>4</sup>

The STASEY study is one of the largest open-label studies primarily assessing the safety and tolerability of a medicine for adults and adolescents with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors. Final data from the STASEY study, evaluating the safety and tolerability of Hemlibra prophylaxis in adults and adolescents with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors, will be presented at the congress.<sup>1</sup> These results confirm the favourable safety profile of Hemlibra, as previously demonstrated in the phase III HAVEN clinical trials.<sup>1,5,6,7</sup>

Spark Therapeutics will share updated data from the ongoing phase I/II clinical trial of SPK-8011, an investigational AAV-based gene therapy developed for the treatment of haemophilia A. These data demonstrate that hepatocyte expression of factor VIII can be stable and durable for up to four years following vector administration, with an acceptable safety profile.<sup>2</sup>

“We are looking forward to sharing data on our investigational gene therapy, SPK-8011, which is being evaluated in the largest phase I/II gene therapy trial in haemophilia A to date, and which reinforces Spark’s mission to bring a novel gene therapy option to persons with haemophilia A,” said Gallia Levy, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, Spark Therapeutics.

<strong>SPK-8011 data presentation</strong>
Updated results from Spark’s ongoing phase I/II study of investigational SPK-8011 will be shared as an oral presentation during the meeting. These data highlight the safety profile and durability of SPK-8011 in 18 participants, up to four years following vector administration with SPK-8011 in four dose cohorts, ranging from <em>5x10</em><sup><em>11</em></sup><em> vg/kg</em> to <em>2×10</em><sup><em>12</em></sup> <em>vg/kg</em>, with results showing a 93% reduction in annualised bleed rate (ABR) and a 97% reduction in annualised infusion rate.<sup>2</sup>

<strong>Key </strong><strong>Hemlibra</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>haemophilia</strong><strong> data presentations</strong>
Final data from the STASEY study presented at the congress demonstrate that Hemlibra is effective, with ABRs consistent with observations reported from the pivotal HAVEN studies.<sup>1,5,6,7 </sup>Additionally, no new safety signals were identified in adults and adolescents with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors, consistent with previous safety observations.<sup>1</sup>

Roche will also present a retrospective analysis comparing ABR and Hemlibra concentrations among obese and non-obese adults with haemophilia A from pooled data from the HAVEN 1, 3, and 4 studies.<sup>8</sup> These data suggest that body weight does not significantly impact the efficacy of Hemlibra, regardless of dosing regimen, demonstrating that Hemlibra offers an effective, well tolerated treatment, with flexible dosing options, in obese and non-obese people with haemophilia A.

Additionally, an analysis of data from the 2017 CHESS PAEDs (Cost of Haemophilia across Europe: a Socioeconomic Survey in the Paediatric Population) study, examining the association between physical activity levels and bleed rates in children with haemophilia A, will be presented.<sup>9</sup> Results from this analysis demonstrate the potential treatment needs and clinical burden in physically active children with moderate and severe haemophilia A receiving factor VIII replacement therapy.

<strong>About </strong><strong>Hemlibra</strong><strong>® (</strong><strong>emicizumab</strong><strong>)</strong>
Hemlibra is approved for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors in over 100 countries worldwide for those with inhibitors and over 80 countries for those without inhibitors, in adults and children, ages newborn and older. Hemlibra is a bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody. It is designed to bring together factor IXa and factor X, proteins involved in the natural coagulation cascade, and restore the blood clotting process for people with haemophilia A. Hemlibra is a prophylactic (preventative) treatment that can be administered by an injection of a ready-to-use solution under the skin (subcutaneously) once-weekly, every two weeks or every four weeks (after an initial once-weekly dose for the first four weeks). Hemlibra was created by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and is being co-developed globally by Chugai, Roche and Genentech. It is marketed in the United States by Genentech as Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh), with kxwh as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration.

<strong>About SPK-8011 for </strong><strong>haemophilia</strong><strong> A</strong>
Investigational SPK-8011, a novel bio-engineered adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector utilizing the AAV-LK03 capsid, also referred to as Spark200, contains a codon-optimized human factor VIII gene under the control of a liver-specific promoter. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted orphan-disease designation and breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S., while the European Commission has granted orphan designation to SPK-8011.

<strong>About </strong><strong>haemophilia</strong><strong> A</strong>
Haemophilia A is an inherited, serious disorder in which a person’s blood does not clot properly, leading to uncontrolled and often spontaneous bleeding. Haemophilia A affects around 900,000 people worldwide,<sup>10,11</sup> approximately 35-39% of whom have a severe form of the disorder.<sup>11 </sup>People with haemophilia A either lack or do not have enough of a clotting protein called factor VIII. In a healthy person, when a bleed occurs, factor VIII brings together the clotting factors IXa and X, which is a critical step in the formation of a blood clot to help stop bleeding. Depending on the severity of their disorder, people with haemophilia A can bleed frequently, especially into their joints or muscles.<sup>10</sup> These bleeds can present a significant health concern as they often cause pain and can lead to chronic swelling, deformity, reduced mobility, and long-term joint damage.<sup>3</sup> A serious complication of treatment is the development of inhibitors to factor VIII replacement therapies.<sup>12</sup> Inhibitors are antibodies developed by the body’s immune system that bind to and block the efficacy of replacement factor VIII,<sup>13</sup> making it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a level of factor VIII sufficient to control bleeding.

MALVERN, Pa., and HYDERABAD, India, July 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <u>Ocugen, Inc.</u> (NASDAQ: OCGN), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing gene therapies to cure blindness diseases and developing a vaccine to save lives from COVID-19, today announced that its co-development partner, Bharat Biotech, shared positive results of its Phase 3 study of COVAXIN™, a whole virion inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate.  COVAXIN™ demonstrated a vaccine efficacy in mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease of 77.8% with efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease alone of 93.4%.

“As we brace ourselves for the potential next wave of COVID-19 outbreaks from the Delta variant, reporting of the final efficacy analysis from this Phase 3 study comes at a crucial time.  We expect these efficacy and safety outcomes, along with demonstrated efficacy against emerging variants of concern, will support our initiatives to bring COVAXIN™ to the US and Canadian markets,” said Dr. Shankar Musunuri, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Ocugen.

“With the Delta variant becoming a dominant strain of COVID-19 in the United States, we believe that the Phase 3 efficacy results reported by Bharat Biotech demonstrate that COVAXIN™ has the potential to become an important option to expand protection against this emerging variant. Combining these data with the only Delta-variant results from a controlled Phase 3 clinical trial, evidence continues to support a favorable benefit-risk profile for COVAXIN™,” said Dr. Bruce Forrest, Acting Chief Medical Officer and a member of the vaccine scientific advisory board of Ocugen.

<strong>Phase 3 Results as Reported by Bharat Biotech</strong>
Bharat Biotech’s Phase 3 clinical trial enrolled 25,798 participants across 25 sites and between 18-98 years of age in India, including 2,750 over the age of 60 and 7,065 with comorbidities. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 clinical trial is based on the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second study vaccination in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants at baseline.

“The safety and efficacy readouts from Phase III clinical trials present a comprehensive data package for COVAXIN™. This has been a great journey of science leading to translational product development to combat this deadly pandemic,” added Dr. Krishna Ella, Chairman &amp; Managing Director, Bharat Biotech. “We continue our efforts towards additional studies on variants of concern. Our commitment to data transparency has been sustained with 10 publications within the past year, and we will share our findings with regulators worldwide.”

COVAXIN™ demonstrated overall efficacy of 77.8% (95% CI; 65.2-86.4), achieving its primary endpoint. One hundred and thirty positive COVID-19 cases were observed: 24 in the vaccine group and 106 in the placebo group. Sixteen severe cases were observed: one in the vaccine group and 15 in the placebo group, achieving an efficacy of 93.4% (95% CI; 57.1-99.8) with respect to severe COVID-19 infection.

In the Phase 3 trial conducted by Bharat Biotech, subjects vaccinated with COVAXIN™ achieved greater protection against emerging B.1.617.2 (delta) and B.1.351 (beta) variants than those who had previous natural infections. Results showed an efficacy rate of 65.2% (95% CI; 33.1-83.0).

Adverse events reported were low, with 12.4% of subjects experiencing commonly known side effects and less than 0.5% of subjects feeling serious adverse events, side effects that keep many from considering taking current vaccines. Both adverse events and severe adverse events reported in the vaccine group were reported at similar rates to the placebo group.

Ocugen recently announced that it will pursue submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, COVAXIN™ in the United States and has initiated discussions with Health Canada for regulatory approval.

<strong>About COVAXIN</strong><strong>™</strong>
COVAXIN™, India's COVID-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech, is developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., July 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NGM) today announced that the company has entered into an amended and restated agreement with Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, to extend their ongoing collaboration through March 2024 but with a narrower scope. NGM disclosed in March 2021 that NGM and Merck were negotiating modifications to certain terms of the agreement to better address their respective evolving priorities. Going forward, the collaboration will focus primarily on the development of novel medicines for unmet patient needs in retinal and CVM diseases, including heart failure. Merck retains an option to license those programs being advanced under the amended collaboration. NGM gains worldwide rights to its disclosed oncology portfolio, as well as all preclinical, and current and future research, assets falling outside of the amended collaboration’s narrower scope, subject to a low single digit net sales royalty to Merck.

“We are pleased to continue to collaborate with Merck to address retinal and CVM diseases that represent significant unmet needs, while moving forward with greater independence and flexibility to advance our broader portfolio of assets,” said Dr. David J. Woodhouse, Chief Executive Officer at NGM. “We now have a portfolio of four disclosed wholly owned programs as well as multiple undisclosed preclinical and research programs, which puts us in a fundamentally different position. Moreover, our in-house discovery engine can now work on programs solely for NGM’s benefit outside of Merck’s targeted areas. Bolstered by a strong balance sheet with runway expected to take us into the first half of 2024, we are well-positioned to advance multiple value-driving opportunities for stockholders.”

“Key to the success of our collaboration with NGM has been our companies’ unwavering commitment to scientific excellence,” said Dr. Dean Li, President, Merck Research Laboratories. “Our continued investment in NGM is due to the concentrated and reproducible effort of NGM scientists to select a problem, dissect and understand the molecular basis for it, and think carefully about how to address it. This amended agreement now enables the application of NGM’s biology-centric discovery approach to further explore new opportunities in important therapeutics areas such as retinal and cardiometabolic diseases.”

The amended collaboration’s primary focus on retinal and CVM diseases builds upon progress with NGM621 and MK-3655, both discovered by NGM under the collaboration. NGM621, an anti-complement C3 antibody, is currently being evaluated in the NGM-led Phase 2 CATALINA study in patients with geographic atrophy. MK-3655, an FGFR1c/KLB agonistic antibody previously licensed by Merck, is currently being evaluated in the Merck-led global Phase 2b study in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NGM will pursue further research and development on two undisclosed retinal targets, as well as CVM targets initially focusing on heart failure. NGM has agreed to work exclusively with Merck in heart failure during the remaining collaboration term. Merck retains an option to license assets directed to targets that are developed by NGM within the scope of the amended collaboration at proof-of-concept or at earlier points as specified in the amended collaboration.

NGM’s currently disclosed oncology product candidates, all derived from the company’s in-house discovery engine, are now wholly owned by NGM and include: NGM120, a GFRAL antagonistic antibody in Phase 2 study for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer and cancer-related cachexia; NGM707, an anti-ILT2/ILT4 dual antagonist antibody; and NGM438, a LAIR1 antagonist antibody. In addition, NGM now has full rights to existing preclinical and research assets, as well as any future assets resulting from its in-house discovery engine, in each case that fall outside of the amended collaboration’s narrower scope. NGM will be funding these programs going forward.

Under the terms of the amended collaboration, Merck will provide an aggregate of approximately $120 million in research and development funding to NGM through March 2024, including $86 million for the period from April 2021 through March 2022, plus additional potential option payments if Merck exercises any license option. The amended collaboration is in place through at least March 2024, with possible extensions for each of the various programs to allow NGM or Merck to complete ongoing development. NGM has committed to advancing an undisclosed ocular program to a potential IND submission, utilizing its own funding after March 2022.  Economics for programs for which Merck exercises its license option are unchanged from the original collaboration terms. Prior to Merck initiating any Phase 3 study of a program licensed by Merck, NGM may elect to receive milestone or royalty payments or, in certain cases, co-fund development and participate in a global cost and profit share arrangement of up to 50%. NGM also has the option to participate in the co-promotion of any co-funded program in the United States.

A Current Report on Form 8-K describing the terms of the amended collaboration in more detail will be filed by NGM, and this press release is subject to the further detail provided in the Form 8-K.

<strong>BALTIMORE, July 1, 2021</strong> – Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Lupin), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Company’s supplemental New Drug Application to expand the use of SOLOSEC® (secnidazole) to include the treatment of trichomoniasis in adults. Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral, curable sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the U.S., affecting an estimated three to five million people every year.<sup>1</sup> SOLOSEC® was approved in the U.S. in 2017 for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in adult women. The supplemental approval makes SOLOSEC® the first and only single-dose oral prescription antimicrobial agent approved for the treatment of both trichomoniasis and BV.

“The FDA’s approval for the additional indication for SOLOSEC® to treat trichomoniasis builds upon our commitment to support women’s health and provides health care professionals with an option to treat patients with trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis (BV), which research demonstrates that approximately 70% of women with trichomoniasis are PCR positive for BV,<sup>2</sup>” said <strong>Jon Stelzmiller,</strong> <strong>President – Specialty, Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc</strong>. He also stated, “Additionally, having a treatment option for both trichomoniasis and BV that provides a complete course of therapy in a single dose will help address gaps in care related to adherence,<sup>3</sup> and therefore, may reduce risk factors associated with trichomoniasis or BV,<sup>4,5</sup> such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)<sup>6,7,8</sup> and other STIs.<sup>9,10”</sup>

The approval is based, in part, on trial results that demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant cure rate of 92.2% for patients with trichomoniasis treated with SOLOSEC® (n=64) as compared to placebo (p&lt;0.001) (n=67) in the modified intent-to-treat population, patients who had trichomoniasis and no other STIs (94.9% in the Per-Protocol population) in the landmark Phase 3 clinical trial. SOLOSEC® was generally well-tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed in the trial, and the most commonly reported adverse events were vulvovaginal candidiasis (2.7%) and nausea (2.7%). The data were recently published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in March 2021 and presented at the 2020 Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (IDSOG) Virtual Annual Meeting.

SOLOSEC® is now available for both treatment of patients and their partners.<sup>11</sup> The FDA approval of SOLOSEC® for the treatment of trichomoniasis in men was granted based on four open-label trials in males; one comparative study with metronidazole and ornidazole in males only and three single-arm studies in males and females.<sup>11</sup> Parasitological evaluation was performed both pre- and post-treatment and reported cure rates ranging from 91.7% (165/180) to 100% (30/30) at time points ranging from two to 20 days (n=437, 211 males and 226 females).<sup>11</sup>

“Trichomoniasis is a highly prevalent STI that can increase an individual’s risk for contracting or spreading other STIs, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For approximately 70% of patients, trichomoniasis infection is asymptomatic. <sup>12,13,14</sup> If left untreated, trichomoniasis can persist for months or years<sup>14</sup> and result in adverse reproductive health outcomes, including infertility and preterm birth,<sup>3”</sup> said Steven Chavoustie, M.D., FACOG, CCRP, Obstetrician and Gynecologist, Segal Institute for Clinical Research. He also stated, “For these reasons, screening and treatment for trichomoniasis is crucial and I am pleased that there is a new treatment option available to help meet the needs of this patient population.”

Since trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease, sexual partners should be treated with the same dose and at the same time, to prevent reinfection. Prescribers may consider presumptively treating partners by expedited partner therapy (EPT) where allowed by law.

<strong>About Trichomoniasis</strong>
Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral, curable sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the U.S., and is caused by a protozoan parasite called Trichomonas Vaginalis (<em>T. vaginalis</em>).<sup>12</sup> An estimated three to five million people have the infection every year.<sup>1</sup>

Trichomoniasis is four-to-five times more prevalent in women compared to men.<sup>15</sup> However, 72% of male partners of women with trichomoniasis were also infected and 77% of those males were asymptomatic.<sup>16</sup> Therefore, it is important for partners to be treated at the same time so that the infection is not passed back and forth. Signs and symptoms in women can include itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals, discomfort with urination and vaginal discharge.<sup>12</sup>

According to the CDC, diagnostic testing for trichomoniasis should be performed in women seeking care for vaginal discharge.<sup>14</sup> Patients receiving care in high-prevalence settings (e.g., sexually transmitted disease clinics) and asymptomatic patients at high risk for infection (e.g., persons with multiple sex partners, history of sexually transmitted diseases/infections) may also be considered for screening.<sup>14</sup> At-risk women with trichomoniasis have an increased risk for PID and a 2.6 times increased risk for persistent endometritis.<sup>8</sup> Women who are pregnant with inadequately treated trichomoniasis are at an increased risk for pregnancy complications such as pre-term birth, premature rupture of membranes, or chorioamnionitis.<sup>17, 18, 19</sup>

Up to 53% of women with HIV infection also have <em>T. vaginalis</em>, which is associated with an increased risk of contracting PID..<sup>14</sup> Routine screening of asymptomatic women with HIV infection for <em>T. vaginalis</em> is recommended because of the adverse events associated with asymptomatic trichomoniasis and HIV infection.<sup>14</sup>

<strong>About Bacterial Vaginosis</strong>
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection caused by an imbalance of bacteria naturally found in the vagina.<sup>20</sup> Symptoms of BV include an unpleasant or fishy odor, discharge (thin, milky grayish-white), or excessive discharge, and sometimes itching, burning sensation or irritation.<sup>20,21</sup> However, some women may have no symptoms.<sup>21</sup> BV is the most common vaginal infection for women, affecting more than 21 million women in the U.S. each year.<sup>22</sup>

BV provides a high pH, contributing to a favorable environment allowing <em>T. vaginalis</em>, the protozoan parasite that causes trichomoniasis, to grow.<sup>12,23</sup> In the Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora, women who presented for routine health visits and were diagnosed with BV were 1.5 to two times more likely to develop trichomonal, gonococcal and/or chlamydial infections.<sup>23</sup> Trichomoniasis and BV can increase risks for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),<sup>6,7,8</sup> acquisition of STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV), <sup>9,10</sup> and acquisition or transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<sup>10</sup>

SOLOSEC® is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the CDC for the treatment of BV.<sup>1, 24</sup>

<strong>About SOLOSEC®</strong>
SOLOSEC® (secnidazole) 2 g oral granules is the first and only single-dose oral prescription approved to treat both bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common vaginal infection, in adult women and trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection, in adults.<sup>11</sup> SOLOSEC® is designed to be easy to take and one oral dose contains a complete course of treatment.<sup>11,25</sup> Additional information about SOLOSEC® can be found at <a href=""https://www.solosec.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">www.SOLOSEC.com</a>.

<strong>INDICATION</strong>
SOLOSEC® (secnidazole) 2 g oral granules is an antimicrobial agent indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in adult women and trichomoniasis in adults. Since trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease, treat sexual partners of infected patients with the same dose and at the same time to prevent reinfection.

<strong>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</strong>
SOLOSEC® is a single-dose therapy for oral use. The entire contents of SOLOSEC® packet should be sprinkled onto applesauce, yogurt or pudding and consumed once within 30 minutes without chewing or crunching the granules. SOLOSEC® is not intended to be dissolved in any liquid. Avoid consumption of alcoholic beverages and preparations containing ethanol or propylene glycol during treatment with SOLOSEC® and for at least 2 days after completing therapy.

<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>SOLOSEC® is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to secnidazole or other nitroimidazole derivatives.</li>
 	<li>Vulvovaginal candidiasis may develop with SOLOSEC® and require treatment with an antifungal agent.</li>
 	<li>Potential risk of carcinogenicity is unknown and has not been studied in patients. Carcinogenicity has been seen in rodents chronically treated with nitroimidazole derivatives, which are structurally related to secnidazole. Chronic use should be avoided.</li>
 	<li>Breastfeeding is not recommended. Patients should discontinue breastfeeding for 96 hours after administration of SOLOSEC®.</li>
 	<li>Most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials (incidence =2%) were vulvovaginal candidiasis, headache, nausea, dysgeusia, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vulvovaginal pruritus.</li>

<b>About SPR206</b>

SPR206 is a potentially best-in-class, novel polymyxin derivative that was designed to reduce the kidney toxicity that is seen clinically with polymyxin B and colistin. Polymyxins are antibiotics frequently used as a last resort for challenging MDR gram-negative infections, but they are associated with significant neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers conducted by our partner Spero Therapeutics, SPR206 appeared well tolerated at doses likely to be within a therapeutic range for MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections. Importantly, it also showed no evidence of nephrotoxicity at the doses tested.

<strong>NEW YORK, July 1, 2021 – Immunic, Inc. (Nasdaq: IMUX), </strong>a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing best-in-class, oral therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of its Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the phase 3 ENSURE program of lead asset IMU-838, the company’s selective oral DHODH inhibitor, in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In addition, the FDA also cleared the company’s separate IND application for the supportive phase 2 CALLIPER trial of IMU-838 in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS).

The ENSURE program comprises two multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase 3 trials designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IMU-838 versus placebo in RRMS patients. Based on IMU-838’s robust activity in preventing lesion formation in the company’s phase 2 EMPhASIS trial in RRMS, the strong and consistent correlation observed between lesion formation and clinical relapse in third-party clinical trials, and the drug’s robust safety profile to date, Immunic believes that this phase 3 program provides a simple and straightforward path towards potential regulatory approval of IMU-838 in RRMS.

The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 CALLIPER trial is intended to run concurrently with and to complement the phase 3 program in RRMS. In particular, CALLIPER is focused on progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and designed to corroborate IMU-838’s neuroprotective potential, as exemplified by slowing of brain atrophy and delay in disability worsening. Neurodegeneration is a key concern in both PMS and RRMS, since axonal and neural damage is responsible for the increasing and often severe disability experienced by patients. Immunic believes that, if the CALLIPER trial is successful in showing a beneficial effect of IMU-838, this data, along with the ENSURE program and IMU-838’s strong safety and tolerability profile, may allow for a meaningful clinical differentiation of IMU-838 from other oral MS medications and an attractive commercial positioning. Although a supportive trial, Immunic does not believe that data from the CALLIPER trial are a pre-condition for filing a New Drug Application in RRMS.

“IMU-838’s phase 2 results in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis showed an encouraging balance between efficacy, safety, and tolerability and I look forward to the phase 3 program in this indication,” commented <strong>Robert J. Fox, M.D., Staff Neurologist, Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Vice-Chair for Research, Neurologic Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, and</strong> <strong>Coordinating Investigator of the ENSURE and CALLIPER programs.</strong> “Disability progression is a principal concern for clinicians and patients of both PMS and RRMS. The ongoing disability worsening, even in periods without relapse, not only diminishes quality-of-life but can also ultimately lead to profound impairments in patient mobility. There is a clear unmet need for new therapeutic options which can help delay or arrest this process and I look forward to seeing data on IMU-838’s neuroprotective potential.” Dr. Fox receives compensation as a chair of the steering committees for the ENSURE and CALLIPER programs.

“IND clearance for our phase 3 program in RRMS is yet another seminal moment for Immunic as it progresses our lead asset, IMU-838, into a pivotal program and heralds the final phase of clinical development in MS. We believe that the phase 3 ENSURE program meaningfully simplifies IMU-838’s regulatory approval path in MS as it applies a very clean and straightforward study design,” stated <strong>Daniel Vitt, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Immunic</strong>. “In addition, together with our MS expert panel, we designed the CALLIPER trial to study patients who currently are not typically treated with relapse preventing therapies. Our goal is to highlight IMU-838 as a therapy that combines truly differentiated safety and tolerability with neuroprotective activity such as slowing of brain atrophy and disability worsening. In our view, success in the CALLIPER trial could provide an important differentiator for IMU-838 in the MS market. We look forward to hopefully providing IMU-838 as an important new therapeutic option to MS patients within the next few years.”

Each of the identical twin phase 3 trials, titled ENSURE-1 and ENSURE-2, is expected to enroll approximately 1,050 adult patients with active RMS at more than 100 sites in 14 countries, including the United States, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and India. Patients will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to either 30 mg daily doses of IMU-838 or placebo and the primary endpoint for both trials is time to first relapse up to 72 weeks. Key secondary endpoints include volume of new T2-lesions, time to confirmed disability progression, time to sustained clinically relevant changes in cognition, and percentage of whole brain volume change, grey matter volume, and white matter volume. With regard to the disability progression endpoint, the ENSURE program applies a pooled analysis of disability worsening across both trials, which may be further supported by data from the CALLIPER trial.

The ENSURE trials will be run concurrently, with dosing of the first patient expected in the second half of 2021. An interim analysis to assess event rates is planned to occur after a certain number of relapses have occurred in the double-blind treatment periods. This analysis is intended to inform potential sample size adjustment and help ensure that final study readout is not planned to occur before sufficient events have been achieved. This interim analysis is not intended as a futility analysis.

The phase 2 CALLIPER trial is expected to enroll approximately 450 patients at more than 70 sites in North America, Western, Central and Eastern Europe with patients randomized to either 45 mg daily doses of IMU-838 or placebo in a double-blinded fashion. The trial’s primary endpoint is the annualized rate of percent brain volume change up to 120 weeks. Key secondary endpoints include the annualized rate of change in whole brain atrophy and time to 24-week confirmed disability progression based on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Dosing of the first patient is expected in the third quarter of 2021.

An interim analysis comprising an unblinded analysis of serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) is planned to occur once approximately half of the enrolled patients have completed 24 weeks of treatment. NfL has been shown consistently to correlate with disease activity in neurological disorders and has become one of the most important serum biomarkers for axonal damage over the past few years. As previously reported, results of the phase 2 EMPhASIS trial of IMU-838 in RRMS showed a robust decrease in serum NfL at 24 weeks (-17.0% for 30 mg and -20.5% for 45 mg), as compared to baseline values, while the patients on placebo experienced a 6.5% increase in serum NfL over the same period.

“The Immunic team is very excited to see IMU-838 progressing into a pivotal program in RRMS. Based on its very strong safety and tolerability profile along with its robust efficacy, which we are planning to further highlight with neuroprotective data from the CALLIPER trial, we believe that IMU-838 has the potential to become a well-differentiated new treatment option for MS patients,” added <strong>Andreas Muehler, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Immunic</strong>. “In our discussions with regulatory authorities, including the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, testing IMU-838 against placebo was viewed as a reasonable approach for our phase 3 program, from both a regulatory and scientific perspective, as placebo provides the cleanest comparator to show proof-of-efficacy and to underline IMU-838’s existing safety and tolerability profile.”

<strong>About Multiple Sclerosis</strong>
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. In MS, myelin, the coating that protects the nerves, is attacked and damaged by the immune system. Thus, MS is considered an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. MS affects approximately one million people in the United States, and more than 2.8 million people worldwide. The disease mainly affects young adults of prime working age, although MS can occur at any age. MS is at least two to three times more common in women than in men.

Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of the disease. Approximately 85% of patients with MS are expected to develop RRMS, with some of these patients later developing more progressive forms of the disease. RRMS is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These relapses are followed by periods of remission, or partial or complete recovery. During remissions, all symptoms may disappear, or some symptoms may continue and become permanent. MS is a progressive disease which, without effective treatment, leads to severe disability.

Progressive MS (PMS) includes both primary progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). PPMS is characterized by steadily worsening neurologic function from the onset of symptoms without initial relapse or remissions. SPMS is identified following an initial relapsing remitting course, after which the disease becomes more steadily progressive, with or without other disease activity present.

<strong>About IMU-838</strong>
IMU-838 is an orally available, next-generation selective immune modulator that inhibits the intracellular metabolism of activated immune cells by blocking the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). IMU-838 acts on activated T and B cells while leaving other immune cells largely unaffected and allows the immune system to stay functioning, e.g. in fighting infections. In previous trials, IMU-838 did not show an increased rate of infections compared to placebo. In addition, DHODH inhibitors, such as IMU-838, are known to possess a host-based antiviral effect, which is independent with respect to specific virus proteins and their structure. Therefore, DHODH inhibition may be broadly applicable against multiple viruses. IMU-838 was successfully tested in two phase 1 clinical trials in 2017 and is currently being tested in a phase 2 trial in patients with ulcerative colitis. In the third quarter of 2020, the company reported positive results from its phase 2 EMPhASIS trial of IMU-838 in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, achieving both primary and key secondary endpoints with high statistical significance. In the first quarter of 2021, Immunic announced that IMU-838 showed evidence of clinical activity in its phase 2 CALVID-1 trial in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19. Also, in the first quarter of 2021, the company reported positive top-line data from an investigator-sponsored phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of IMU-838 in primary sclerosing cholangitis which was conducted in collaboration with Mayo Clinic. To date, IMU-838 has been tested in more than 800 individuals and has shown an attractive pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability profile. IMU-838 is not yet licensed or approved in any country.

Under the agreement, Sperogenix will have the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize ABSK021 in mainland <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, Hong Kong SAR and Macao SAR (collectively, the ""Sperogenix Territory"") for non-oncology rare neurological diseases indications, of which amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) will be the first indication to be developed by Sperogenix. Abbisko will receive an upfront payment and a series of milestone payments as well as royalties on annual net sales from Sperogenix, and reserves the rights for all the other territories and indications. Sperogenix will be responsible for the development of ABSK021 in ALS, including preclinical studies, proof-of-concept clinical trials, pivotal clinical trials, and post-marketing studies, as well as the registration and commercialization of the product in the Sperogenix Territory.

<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

ABSK021 is an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) antagonist. Phase Ib clinical trials on safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in oncology patients are being initiated both in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>. Preliminary clinical data has demonstrated that ABSK021 was well tolerated, with favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and effective modulation of the target. CSF-1R signal transduction is involved in the development and survival of microglia. The presence of a large number of activated microglia is one of the hallmarks of neurodegeneration in ALS patients. Preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of CSF-1R could prevent disease progression of ALS in a variety of animal models.

In the summer of 2014, a rare disease known as ALS was introduced to the public with the worldwide ""Ice Bucket Challenge"". The clinical characteristics of ALS are progressive limb weakness, muscular atrophy combined with pyramidal sign, accompanied by alalia, dysphagia and other bulbar symptoms, dyspnea caused by respiratory muscle deterioration and eventually death due to nutrition depletion and respiratory failure. According to an analysis of the national medical insurance data by the ALS cooperative group of the Neurology Society of Chinese Medical Association, the annual incidence of ALS in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> is 1.62 per 100,000, and the annual prevalence rate is 2.97 per 100,000. At present, there is no specific treatment for the disease, and the prognosis is poor. The median survival time is only 3 to 5 years, which imposes heavy burden on families and society physically, emotionally and economically.

Mr. Yan Zhiyu, Co-founder, Chairman and CEO of Sperogenix, said, ""Rare neurological diseases such as ALS have a serious impact on patients' survival time and quality of life, which places a heavy burden on patients' families and society. A series of innovative therapies are urgently needed to improve the status of this disease field. Rare neurological diseases is a key area for Sperogenix. The strong cooperation with Abbisko will accelerate the clinical development and commercialization process of ABSK021, further strengthen our product portfolio in this field, and to establish Sperogenix's leading position in the space of rare neurological diseases in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.""

""This cooperation between Abbisko and Sperogenix is encouraging and demonstrates the great potential of ABSK021, an innovative CSF-1R drug candidate in the field of neurological diseases"" said Dr. Xu Yaochang, Founder and CEO of Abbisko, ""Sperogenix has impressive clinical research, development and commercialization capabilities in the field of rare diseases, and we are confident that this cooperation will further accelerate the development process of ABSK021 and benefit patients with rare diseases in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.""

<p align=""justify"">HONG KONG, SHANGHAI and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., July 05, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“HUTCHMED”) (Nasdaq/AIM: HCM; HKEX: 13) has initiated a Phase I study of HMPL-295, its investigative and highly selective oral inhibitor of ERK, which is a downstream component of the RAS-MAPK<sup>1</sup> pathway signaling cascade. HMPL-295 has the potential to address intrinsic or acquired resistance from upstream mechanisms such as RAS, RAF and MEK. This is our first of multiple candidates in discovery addressing the RAS-MAPK pathway. The first patient was dosed on July 2, 2021.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The clinical trial is a multi-center, open-label study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy profile of HMPL-295, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose (“RP2D”) in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors. Following the initial dose escalation stage, another 10 to 15 patients will be enrolled at the RP2D to further evaluate its safety and the preliminary efficacy of HMPL-295. An exploratory study on the pharmacokinetic biomarkers of HMPL-295 is also planned. Additional details may be found at clinicaltrials.gov, using identifier NCT04908046.</p>
<p align=""justify"">We currently retain all rights to HMPL-295 worldwide.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About ERK and the RAS-MAPK pathway</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The RAS-MAPK pathway is dysregulated in human diseases, particularly cancer, in which mutations or nongenetic events hyperactivate the pathway in more than 50% of cancers. Activating mutations in RAS genes occur in more than 30% of cancers. RAS and RAF predict worse clinical prognosis in a wide variety of tumor types, mediate resistance to targeted therapies, and decrease the response to the approved standards of care, namely, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. On the RAS-MAPK pathway, KRAS inhibitors are under clinical evaluation, and acquired resistance develops for RAF/MEK targeted therapies. ERK inhibition has the potential to overcome or avoid the intrinsic or acquired resistance from upstream mechanisms such as these.</p>

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expanded label for KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) that is not curable by surgery or radiation. This approval is based on data from the second interim analysis of the Phase 2 KEYNOTE-629 trial, in which KEYTRUDA demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 50% (95% CI, 36-64) (n=54), including a complete response rate of 17% and a partial response rate of 33% in the cohort of patients with locally advanced disease. Among the 27 responding patients, 81% had a duration of response (DOR) of six months or longer, and 37% had a DOR of 12 months or longer. In June 2020, KEYTRUDA was granted its first indication in cSCC, as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic disease that is not curable by surgery or radiation.

“This approval is great news for these patients and further demonstrates Merck’s commitment to the skin cancer community. KEYTRUDA has shown meaningful efficacy in patients with locally advanced or recurrent or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that cannot be cured by surgery or radiation,” said Dr. Vicki Goodman, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “This expanded indication reinforces the role of KEYTRUDA in this cancer type, which is the second most common form of non-melanoma skin cancer.”

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time during or after treatment with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatologic reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of KEYTRUDA. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or permanently discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.

<strong>Data Supporting the Approval</strong>

The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-629 (ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03284424&amp;esheet=52454850&amp;newsitemid=20210706005062&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT03284424&amp;index=1&amp;md5=fad95443102840675843ee82c70a0ac1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03284424</a>), a multicenter, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label trial that enrolled patients with recurrent or metastatic cSCC or locally advanced cSCC. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression.

Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or a maximum of 24 months. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of KEYTRUDA during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status.

Assessment of tumor status was performed every six weeks during the first year and every nine weeks during the second year. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DOR as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ.

Among the 54 patients with locally advanced cSCC treated, the study population characteristics were: median age of 76 years (range, 35 to 95), 80% age 65 or older; 72% male; 83% white, 13% race unknown; 41% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 and 59% ECOG PS of 1. Twenty-two percent received one or more prior lines of therapy; 63% received prior radiation therapy.

The ORR was 50% (95% CI, 36-64), including a complete response rate of 17% and a partial response rate of 33%, for patients treated with KEYTRUDA. After a median follow-up of 13.4 months, the median DOR had not yet been reached (range, 1.0+ to 17.2+ months). Among the 27 responding patients, 81% had a DOR of six months or longer, and 37% had a DOR of 12 months or longer.

Among the 159 patients with advanced cSCC (recurrent or metastatic or locally advanced disease) enrolled in KEYNOTE-629, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 6.9 months (range, 1 day to 28.9 months). Adverse reactions occurring in patients with recurrent or metastatic cSCC or locally advanced cSCC were similar to those occurring in 2,799 patients with melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer treated with KEYTRUDA as a single agent. Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) that occurred at a higher incidence included lymphopenia (10%) and decreased sodium (10%).

<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong>

KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,500 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.

<span class=""bwuline"">Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</span>

<i>KEYTRUDA</i> <i>as a Single Agent</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.

<i>KEYTRUDA with Axitinib</i>

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen, at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT =3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT =3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT =3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</span>

<i>Adrenal Insufficiency</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids.

Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; <i>Gastrointestinal:</i> Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; <i>Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue:</i> Myositis/polymyositis rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; <i>Endocrine:</i> Hypoparathyroidism; <i>Hematologic/Immune:</i> Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

<b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

REYKJAVIK, Iceland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alvotech, the Iceland-based biosimilar company, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the comparative, confirmatory efficacy and safety clinical study (AVT04-GL-301) for AVT04, Alvotech‘s proposed biosimilar to the reference product Stelara®. The objective of the study is to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence between AVT04 and Stelara® in terms of safety, efficacy and immunogenicity in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

The AVT04-GL-301 study is being conducted in five countries in Central and Eastern Europe and it is expected that approximately 530 patients will be enrolled in the study.

In parallel, Alvotech is also conducting a PK similarity study (AVT04-GL-101) to demonstrate equivalent PK endpoints between the proposed biosimilar and the reference product Stelara. The AVT04-GL-101 study, that is also assessing safety and tolerability, is currently ongoing in Australia and New Zealand and is expected to enroll 294 healthy adult volunteers.

Ustekinumab, which is among the highest selling pharmaceutical products in the world, had worldwide sales of $7.7 bn in 2020.

AVT04 is the second proposed biosimilar product from Alvotech entering clinical studies, the first being AVT02, a proposed biosimilar to Humira®. Alvotech is the only known company that has both developed a biosimilar candidate for the high-concentration Humira® and is executing a switching study to support its approval as an interchangeable product.

<b>Róbert Wessman, founder and Chairman of Alvotech, commented:</b>

”As a founder, I am extremely proud to see us enter the second proposed biosimilar product into clinical trials. This brings us closer to our mission to expand patient access to high quality biosimilars at an affordable price.”

<p align=""justify"">SAN DIEGO, July 06, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: SRNE, ""Sorrento"") announced today that the company has received FDA clearance to proceed with a Phase 2 clinical study of RTX for treating moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis of the knee pain (OAK).</p>
<p align=""justify"">The phase 2 trial, a multi-center, double blind, placebo- and active-controlled study, will assess the efficacy and safety of several dose groups of RTX to manage pain in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis of the knee pain (OAK) (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04885972). Given the durability of OA pain relief response to RTX demonstrated thus far, Sorrento has decided to include an active comparator (injectable corticosteroid) in the current trial protocol. Superiority data potentially generated by RTX against a widely used approved drug could be supportive for accelerated international registrations (Europe) and is required for pricing purposes in Europe.</p>
<p align=""justify"">This Phase 2 study follows the analysis of the significant observations from the Phase 1b trial results (NCT03542838) of RTX Day 84 patient data which completed the one year following up of last patient visit in February 2021. This Phase 1b study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled ascending dose study in 94 patients and included an open-label expansion cohort to assess the long-term safety and preliminary efficacy of a single intra-articular administration of RTX or saline control (as placebo group) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee. The magnitude of the difference in the treatment effect (RTX versus saline control) at 12 weeks exceeded what is traditionally considered sufficient to support regulatory approval based on greater than 2 points reduction in WOMAC A1 10-point scale question “pain at walking on flat surface” compared to placebo. RTX met this requirement in this study.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The Phase 1b study was designed to follow patients to day 84 (primary endpoint). Patients were also given the option to be followed for up to a year. Pain relief appeared to be very consistent among patients responding to the initial treatment, with a large proportion of the patients followed past Day 84 showing pain relief sustained beyond all time points assessed through one year follow-up. Fast relief (starting within days, with optimal pain relief level achieved within weeks) and durability of the effect (past 84 days) confirm the clinical potential of the RTX drug for long-term control of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The RTX clinical development program continues, with Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials planned in larger patient populations. The first Phase 2 trial will focus on identifying the recommended Phase 3 dose.</p>

<p align=""justify""><strong>About RTX</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">A thousand times “hotter” than pure capsaicin (16 billion Scoville units versus 16M), and with a high affinity for afferent sensory pain nerves, RTX binds to TRPV1 receptors present and selectively ablates the nerve endings responsible for pain signals experienced by patients<sup>2</sup>. Delivered peripherally (into the joint space) the transient nerve ending ablation effect can have profound clinical benefits lasting for months to years (as shown in canine studies<sup>3</sup>).</p>
<p align=""justify"">PTVA-OA-001 was a multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase 1b study to assess the safety and define the maximally tolerated dose of RTX administered in the knee joint in patients with moderate to severe pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee. The study was a dose-escalation trial in which cohorts of patients receive increasing doses of RTX until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was achieved. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of RTX and identify the recommended Phase 3 dose. The secondary objective was to assess the preliminary efficacy of RTX measured by assessing changes in the intensity of pain using the A1 score from the WOMAC, a widely used proprietary validated pain questionnaire.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>The osteoarthritis treatment market and in particular the Knee Osteoarthritis and injectable markets have historically seen healthy growth and are expected to continue the trend as populations age and present excessive weight. Multiple sources estimate the 2020 market to be around 50M patients and $7B.</em></p>

<span class=""xn-location"">PENNINGTON, N.J.</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">July 6, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- OncoSec Medical Incorporated (NASDAQ:ONCS) (the ""Company"" or ""OncoSec"") today announced it has entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement (""Agreement"") with Merck (known as MSD outside <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>) to evaluate the combination of OncoSec's DNA-plasmid interleukin-12 (IL-12) TAVO™ (tavokinogene telseplasmid) with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab), in a global Phase 3 randomized clinical trial, KEYNOTE-C87.  The planned clinical trial will evaluate the overall survival of patients treated with the TAVO™ in combination with KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> versus standard of care in late-stage patients with metastatic melanoma who are refractory to immune checkpoint therapy.

TAVO™ has received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as a potentially first-in-class, intratumoral anti-cancer gene therapy that expresses IL-12 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, following progression on KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> or OPDIVO<sup>®</sup> (nivolumab).  KEYNOTE-C87 is intended to support accelerated approval by the U.S. FDA and/or serve as a pivotal study to support a full licensure.  Under the terms of the Agreement, Merck will provide KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> , while OncoSec will provide the investigational drug, TAVO™.  Each party will be responsible for its own internal costs, with OncoSec covering third party costs.  Eligible patients must have Stage III or IV unresectable, metastatic melanoma, and must be refractory to prior checkpoint therapy.  KEYNOTE-C87 intends to enroll approximately 400 patients and is planned to be conducted in the U.S., <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, EU, and Australia.

""We are thrilled to enter into this collaboration and supply agreement with Merck – one of the world's leading immuno-oncology companies – to help bring TAVO™ to patients with metastatic melanoma whose disease did not respond to initial checkpoint inhibitor therapy or who have developed progressive disease and therefore do not have additional treatment options available,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Brian Leuthner</span>, Interim Chief Executive Officer of OncoSec.  ""This Phase 3 collaboration represents a crucial milestone for OncoSec as we advance TAVO™ through the clinic and toward potential approval globally, and expands upon our initial 2017 clinical collaboration and supply agreement with Merck.  We look forward to our continued work and progress with Merck and its experienced team of immuno-oncology leaders as we continue to explore TAVO™ in combination with KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> with the goal of helping more patients with cancer.""

<span class=""xn-location"">DUBLIN</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">July 7, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <span class=""xn-org"">Mallinckrodt</span> plc (OTCMKTS: MNKKQ), a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced publication of results from the pivotal Phase 3 STRATA2016 clinical trial of StrataGraft<sup>® </sup>(allogeneic cultured keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts in murine collagen – dsat), which is approved for the treatment of adults with thermal burns containing intact dermal elements for which surgical intervention is clinically indicated (deep partial-thickness burns).  The data were published in <i>Burns</i>, a peer-reviewed journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries. The trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single application of StrataGraft in adult patients with deep partial-thickness thermal burns, achieved both co-primary efficacy endpoints. Please see Important Safety Information for StrataGraft below.

The Phase 3 clinical trial was supported by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). BARDA is providing funding and technical support for the continued development of StrataGraft under Project BioShield Contract No. HHSO100201500027C.

The published data showed that 96% of the burn sites treated with StrataGraft did not require autografting, and 83.1% of patients achieved durable wound closure of the StrataGraft treatment site without autografting by three months. As a reference, 86% of patients achieved durable wound closure of the autograft control sites. The significant reduction in use of autograft in patients treated with StrataGraft resulted in favorable outcomes in the secondary efficacy endpoints of donor site pain and donor site cosmesis (preservation or restoration of physical appearance). Additionally, cosmesis at the StrataGraft and autograft treatment sites was clinically similar at 12 months.

Safety results showed the most common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was pruritus (itching) at the treatment site, which occurred in 36.6% (26 of 71) of patients and was causally related to StrataGraft treatment in 11 patients. All TEAEs related to StrataGraft treatment were mild to moderate in severity. Hypertrophic scarring (HTS) occurred at the StrataGraft treatment site in 12.7% (9 of 71) of patients, and 4.2% (3 of 71) of patients had HTS determined by the investigator to be causally related to StrataGraft treatment.

""Surgical advances have improved survival rates in patients with severe burns. However, new treatments are needed that can help reduce or eliminate autografting, as the need to harvest healthy skin tissue can lead to pain, itching, scarring and impaired function at the donor site,"" said <b><span class=""xn-person"">James H. Holmes, IV</span>, M.D., Co-Lead Investigator of STRATA2016 and Professor, Trauma Surgery, Wake Forest School of Medicine</b>. ""We were encouraged to see in the Phase 3 trial that treatment with StrataGraft eliminated donor tissue harvest in all but three of the 71 study participants. Now that StrataGraft is approved, burn surgeons have an alternative biologic treatment option for patients with deep partial-thickness burns.""

Each year, approximately 40,000 patients in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> require hospitalization for the treatment of severe burns.<sup>1</sup> Autograft is the current standard of care for deep partial-thickness burns – complex skin injuries in which the damage extends through the entire epidermis (outermost layer of skin) and into the lower part of the dermis (innermost layer of skin). Autograft involves the surgical harvesting of healthy skin from an uninjured site on the patient and transplanting the skin graft to the injury, creating a donor site wound and leaving the patient with more wounded areas requiring care.

""This marks the first publication of the full data set from the pivotal Phase 3 StrataGraft clinical trial, and we are pleased to be able to share these important clinical findings with the burn care community,"" said <b><span class=""xn-person"">Steven Romano</span>, M.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at <span class=""xn-org"">Mallinckrodt</span></b>. ""With StrataGraft having received regulatory approval in the U.S. for the treatment of deep partial-thickness burns, we look forward to bringing it to healthcare providers and patients who could benefit.""

Data from the Phase 3 trial supported the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of StrataGraft on <span class=""xn-chron"">June 15, 2021</span>.

<b>Design of STRATA2016<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The open-label, controlled, randomized, multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single application of StrataGraft in the treatment of deep partial-thickness thermal burns. The trial enrolled 71 patients (55 males and 16 females; 78% white and 20% African American) at 12 burn centers across <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>. Eligible patients were age 18 years and older and had thermal burns comprising 3% to 49% total body surface area involving the torso or upper or lower extremities for which surgical excision and autografting were clinically indicated. The study design used an intra-patient comparator, in which two similar areas of burn injury on the same patient were randomly assigned to either StrataGraft treatment or autograft.

The co-primary endpoints were the difference in the percent area of the StrataGraft treatment site and the control autograft treatment site that was autografted by three months and the proportion of patients achieving durable wound closure of the StrataGraft treatment site without autograft placement at three months. Secondary endpoints assessed donor site pain, donor site cosmesis and treatment site cosmesis.

<b>Full Results of STRATA2016<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Results published in <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3218541-1&amp;h=4222837999&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS0305417921001108&amp;a=Burns"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><i>Burns</i></a><i> </i>showed the study met its co-primary efficacy endpoints of autograft sparing and durable wound closure by three months. A significantly smaller area of burn wounds treated with StrataGraft required autografting by three months compared to the area of burn wounds treated exclusively with autograft (p&lt;0.0001). Additionally, 96% (68 of 71) of the burn sites treated with StrataGraft did not require autografting. By three months, 83.1% of patients achieved durable wound closure of the StrataGraft treatment site without autografting (95% CI: 74.4, 91.8), which was clinically similar to that of the autograft control site (86% [95% CI: 77.8, 94.0%]).

Secondary efficacy endpoint data also showed favorable outcomes with StrataGraft. In all but three patients, the StrataGraft treatment site did not need to be autografted, and the donor sites were therefore not harvested. As a result, significantly lower mean donor site pain intensity was observed through Day 14 at StrataGraft donor sites compared with autograft donor sites, as measured by the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale (p&lt;0.0001). At three months, cosmesis data showed the mean donor site Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) observer total score was significantly lower (more like normal skin) for StrataGraft donor sites compared with autograft donor sites (p&lt;0.0001). At 12 months, cosmesis at the StrataGraft and autograft treatment sites was clinically similar, as measured by POSAS total scores by observer.

A molecular analysis of patient biopsies at the StrataGraft treatment site at three months demonstrated that DNA from cells of StrataGraft was not detectable in any patients evaluated, which is consistent with wound healing by the patients' own cells.

Safety results showed the most common TEAE was pruritus (itching) at the treatment site, which occurred in 36.6% (26 of 71) of patients and was causally related to StrataGraft treatment in 11 patients. All TEAEs related to StrataGraft treatment were mild to moderate in severity. HTS occurred at the StrataGraft treatment site in 12.7% (9 of 71) of patients, and 4.2% (3 of 71) of patients had HTS determined by the investigator to be causally related to StrataGraft treatment.

<b>About StrataGraft<br class=""dnr"" /></b>StrataGraft is a viable, bioengineered, allogeneic, cellularized scaffold product derived from keratinocytes grown on gelled collagen containing dermal fibroblasts. StrataGraft is designed to deliver viable cells to support the body's own ability to heal. StrataGraft contains metabolically active cells that produce and secrete a variety of growth factors and cytokines. Growth factors and cytokines are known to be involved in wound repair and regeneration. The product is designed with both dermal and epidermal layers composed of well-characterized human cells. StrataGraft is intended to be applied in appropriate aseptic conditions, such as the operating room, and can be sutured, stapled or secured with a tissue adhesive.

The FDA granted StrataGraft orphan drug designation, and it was among the first products designated by the Agency as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) under the provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. At the time of approval, the FDA awarded Stratatech Corporation, a Mallinckrodt company, a Priority Review Voucher (PRV).

<b><span class=""xn-org"">Mallinckrodt</span> is currently conducting a StrataGraft continued access clinical trial (StrataCAT, <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3218541-1&amp;h=765485053&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04123548%3Fterm%3Dstratagraft%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D5&amp;a=NCT04123548"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT04123548</a>) under an Expanded Access Program (EAP).

The company is planning to evaluate StrataGraft for the treatment of adults with full-thickness burns (also referred to as third-degree burns). Additionally, <span class=""xn-org"">Mallinckrodt</span> plans to conduct a study evaluating StrataGraft in the treatment of pediatric populations. </b>

BARDA expressed interest in StrataGraft as a medical countermeasure in response to large-scale burn incidents, and provided funding and technical support for the continued development of StrataGraft. These efforts are part of BARDA's strategy to build emergency preparedness in response to mass casualty events involving trauma and thermal burns by developing novel medical countermeasures for adult and at-risk populations. In the case of a mass casualty thermal burn event, the Government Accountability Office estimates that more than 10,000 patients might require thermal burn care.<sup>2 </sup>The limited number of specialized burn centers and related medical infrastructure in the United States creates a public health need for therapies that could be deployed quickly for use in these and other care sites.

WARSAW, Poland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Polpharma Biologics Group announces that its joint venture company with Santo Holding (Strüngmann Group), Bioeq, has concluded a commercial partnership with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. for their biosimilar candidate of the ophthalmological drug Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) in Europe, Canada, Israel and New Zealand.

The reference product is a monoclonal anti-angiogenic antibody fragment (Fab) that has been approved to treat the ""wet"" type of age-related macular degeneration, a common form of age-related vision loss. Worldwide, at least 25 to 30 million people are affected by age-related macular degeneration. The launch of a biosimilar Ranibizumab can increase market competition, reduce cost and expand patient access with proven analytical and clinical similarity to the original product.

This agreement with Teva complements an existing agreement concluded with Coherus BioSciences, Inc. for commercialisation in the United States.

Dr Joerg Windisch, CEO of the Polpharma Biologics Group, commented on the achievements of the joint venture:

“This is a huge milestone for the progression of a life changing therapeutic. We are proud the development program has been successfully completed, and that, through this agreement, more patients will gain access to highly effective treatments for vision loss including for age-related macular degeneration. This is another demonstration of our passion for providing safe and effective medicines to patients.”

<b>About the Ranibizumab biosimilar</b>

The Ranibizumab biosimilar, FYB201, was originally licensed in from Formycon AG (FRA: FYB/ WKN A1EWVY), a leading German biosimilars company, and subsequently developed by Bioeq AG, a joint venture between Polpharma Biologics and Santo Holding AG (Strüngmann Group). Phase III clinical trials for FYB201 have clinically demonstrated that the efficacy of FYB201 in patients with nAMD is comparable to that of Lucentis®.

Biosimilars are intended for use in place of existing, branded biologics to treat a range of chronic and often life-threatening diseases, with the potential to reduce costs and expand patient access. Biosimilars exhibit proven analytical and clinical similarity to their respective branded reference products.

TOKYO, July 7, 2021 -- Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 4519) announced that it filed regulatory application with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the anti-cancer agent/humanized anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody Tecentriq<sup>®</sup> Intravenous Infusion 1200 mg [generic name: atezolizumab (genetical recombination)] for the adjuvant treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on July 6, 2021.

“Approximately 50% of patients with early-stage lung cancer experience relapse following surgery. It is very important to prevent recurrence in order to improve the cure rate. Tecentriq is the first cancer immunotherapy which reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death in NSCLC as adjuvant therapy following surgery,” said Chugai’s President and CEO, Dr. Osamu Okuda. “We are working to obtain regulatory approval to deliver Tecentriq, which has been shown to reduce the rate of recurrence or death, to patients as soon as possible as a new adjuvant treatment for early-stage lung cancer.”

This filing is based on the results from phase III IMpower010 study examining Tecentriq as an adjuvant treatment in NSCLC. The study showed for the first time that treatment with Tecentriq following surgery and chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death (disease-free survival; DFS) by 34% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.66, 95% CI: 0.50–0.88) in people with Stage II-IIIA NSCLC, whose tumors express PD-L1=1%, compared with best supportive care (BSC). VENTANA OptiView PD-L1 (SP263) Assay, a pathological testing kit marketed by Roche Diagnostics K.K., was used to detect PD-L1 expression. Safety data for Tecentriq were consistent with its known safety profile and no new safety signals were identified.

<em>About IMpower010 study</em>
IMpower010 is a Phase III, global, multicenter, open-label, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq compared with BSC, in participants with Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC (UICC 7th edition), following surgical resection and up to 4 cycles of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The study randomized 1,005 people with a ratio of 1:1 to receive either at most 16 cycles of Tecentriq or BSC. The primary endpoint is investigator-determined DFS in the PD-L1-positive Stage II-IIIA, all randomized Stage II-IIIA and ITT Stage IB-IIIA populations. Key secondary endpoints include OS in the overall study population, ITT Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC.

<em>About non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</em>
In Japan, 130,000 people (86,800 men and 43,100 women; 2020 predicted values) are estimated to be afflicted with lung cancer each year. 75,600 people in Japan (53,200 men and 22,300 women; 2020 predicted values) die as a result of the disease. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Lung cancer can be broadly divided into small cell lung cancer and NSCLC according to the tissue type. NSCLC has the largest number of patients, accounting for about 85% of all lung cancer cases.

</div>
<div class=""cntBlock"">

<em>About approval status of Tecentriq in Japan</em>
Tecentriq was launched in April 2018 with an indication of unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), followed by an approval for the additional dosing for the treatment of untreated unresectable, advanced or recurrent NSCLC in December 2018. In addition, an approval of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer has been obtained in August 2019, an approval of PD-L1 positive hormone receptor-negative and HER2-negative inoperable or recurrent breast cancer has been obtained in September 2019, and an approval for the additional dosing for the treatment of chemotherapy-naïve unresectable advanced or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC has been obtained in November 2019. Tecentriq was approved for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in September 2020, followed by an approval for the additional dosing for the treatment of untreated PD-L1 positive, unresectable, advanced or recurrent NSCLC in December 2020.

<p align=""justify"">LONDON, July 07, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Treos Bio Limited (“Treos”), a clinical stage biotechnology company using data science and proprietary biomarkers to develop both precision off-the-shelf and personalized peptide cancer immunotherapies, today announced a clinical collaboration with Roche in which Treos will evaluate the combination of PolyPEPI1018, its lead product candidate, and atezolizumab, Roche’s PD-L1-inhibitor, in patients with late stage microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer (MSS mCRC). A Phase I/II trial evaluating PolyPEPI1018 in combination with atezolizumab is expected to begin in Q4 2021.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“This collaboration with Roche affords Treos the unique opportunity to investigate more fully the potential of our off-the-shelf polypeptide cancer immunotherapy and its ability to boost the cancer-killing response of an anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy,” said Dr. Christopher C. Gallen, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Treos. “Treos is eager to explore this combination as we work to meaningfully improve the clinical outcomes for patients living with MSS mCRC, a condition which accounts for approximately 85% of CRC worldwide.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Treos completed a Phase I/II study of PolyPEPI1018 in the first-line maintenance setting in patients with MSS mCRC, OBERTO 101. The trial demonstrated that the therapy was safe and well-tolerated and induced T cell responses against multiple tumor targets. Robust immune responses by patients correlated to clinical benefits. Results were presented in a <a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=gRHm-BMmglXRRs8J9QeGxsn8uxW47Uk9Ob4lpyoXPEe0aW_T1Ly7qmi-a8wjhxVkoi7REu-Wk_gdWtWt3Qtr7MQkDwJUlXpLlqI8VhNgAAqq2kVd_HWOGiptTKqiTjkWq-OuNmoH9hUGI30Dr871Zg=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>poster presentation</u></a> at ASCO 2020.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“In the completed Phase I/II study, the immunotherapy induced a strong tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) response against “cold tumors”, suggesting the potential to convert a “cold” tumor to a “hot” tumor and increase the effect of checkpoint inhibitors in difficult-to-treat solid tumors,” said Dr. Joleen Hubbard, Associate Professor of Medical Oncology at the Mayo Clinic Rochester and Principal Investigator in the Phase I/II study. “In addition, PolyPEPI1018 boosted the T cell responses against specific antigens to which patients had spontaneous immunity, suggesting a potential synergy between PolyPEPI1018 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies. Following the encouraging results from this trial, in which some patients experienced surprising clinical benefits, I look forward to treating patients with this new combination in the upcoming Phase I/II trial.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the terms of the non-exclusive collaboration, Treos is responsible for conducting the study, with Roche providing all required doses of atezolizumab. Treos maintains full ownership of PolyPEPI1018.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About PolyPEPI1018
</strong>PolyPEPI-1018, Treos’ lead product candidate, is an off-the-shelf immunotherapy in clinical development for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, co-developed with a candidate companion diagnostic. The therapy is in development as a first-line maintenance therapy and as a third-line treatment. The companion diagnostic uses Treos’ proprietary <em>PASCal</em> computational tool to identify Personal EPItopes (<em>PEPIs</em>) that are likely to induce antigen-specific T Cell responses in a patient.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Treos Bio Limited</strong>
Treos Bio uses computational data science and proprietary biomarkers to develop precision off-the-shelf and personalized peptide-based cancer immunotherapies. The Company has developed a unique ability to match the antigens expressed by a specific cancer to the individual patient’s target recognition mechanism (HLA). This technology aims to address the challenge of the variability of an individual patient’s clinical responses to cancer immunotherapies. Treos’ lead candidate is PolyPEPI-1018, an off-the-shelf immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, co-developed with a candidate companion diagnostic. Treos is also developing “off-the-shelf” personalized immunotherapies (<em>PEPI Panel</em>) for several types of solid tumors and has completed preclinical development of PolyPEPI immunotherapies in ovarian, breast, bladder, gastric and lung cancers and melanoma.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PureTech Health plc (Nasdaq: PRTC, LSE: PRTC) (“PureTech” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing highly differentiated medicines for devastating diseases, today announced a clinical trial and supply agreement with an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. (Nasdaq: BGNE; HKEX: 06160) to evaluate BeiGene’s tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in combination with PureTech’s LYT-200, an investigational monoclonal antibody targeting galectin-9, for the potential treatment of difficult-to-treat solid tumor indications that are associated with poor survival rates.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Galectin-9 is a pivotal immune modulator widely expressed in multiple difficult-to-treat tumor types and involved in the regulation of tumor promoting inflammatory and immunosuppressive pathways. Inhibition of galectin-9 with targeted antibodies leads to upregulation of immunostimulatory cytokines and anti-tumor activity in preclinical cancer models. LYT-200 is currently being evaluated as a single agent in the first phase of an adaptive Phase 1/2 clinical trial, which, based upon the trial protocol, will be followed by the portion of the trial intended to investigate LYT-200 in combination with tislelizumab. PureTech expects to report topline Phase 1 results in the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, PureTech plans to investigate LYT-200 as a single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and other immunotherapies.

Tislelizumab is potentially differentiated from the currently approved programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies in an engineered fragment crystallizable region (Fc region), which in preclinical studies has been shown to minimize potentially negative interactions with other immune cells. Tislelizumab has been approved in China for four solid tumor indications and regulatory decisions are pending for two additional indications. In January 2021, BeiGene and Novartis entered into a collaboration and license agreement granting Novartis rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize tislelizumab in North America, Europe and Japan.

“After a decade of optimizing use of immuno-oncology therapies, such as the checkpoint inhibitors that have certainly provided a paradigm shift in treating malignant diseases, we in the industry are eager to advance novel breakthrough agents and combinations to serve a wider range of cancer patients. Patients need new options as the first wave of immunotherapies work only in a small percentage of them. Well thought-out combination immunotherapy regimens may be that way forward,” said Aleksandra Filipovic, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Oncology at PureTech. “We believe LYT-200 has the potential to engage the immune system against what are currently intractable cancers, both as a single agent and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. We look forward to evaluating whether LYT-200 in combination with BeiGene’s tislelizumab can improve outcomes for patients with metastatic solid tumors.”

Under the terms of the agreement, PureTech will maintain control of the LYT-200 program, including global R&amp;D and commercial rights. BeiGene has agreed to supply tislelizumab for use in combination with LYT-200.

<b>About LYT-200
</b>LYT-200 is a monoclonal antibody targeting a foundational immunosuppressive protein, galectin-9, for the potential treatment of solid tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, that are difficult to treat and have poor survival rates. PureTech has presented preclinical data demonstrating high expression of galectin-9 across breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma samples and found that the highest levels of galectin-9 correlated with shorter time to disease relapse and poor survival. These data suggest that galectin-9 could be significant both as a therapeutic target for solid tumors for a range of cancers and as a cancer biomarker. Preclinical animal and patient-derived organoid tumor models also showed the potential efficacy of LYT-200 and the importance of galectin-9 as a target. LYT-200 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 adaptive design trial, and results from the Phase 1 portion are expected in the fourth quarter of 2021.

<b>About Tislelizumab
</b>Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc?R on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to Fc?R on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Tislelizumab is the first drug from BeiGene’s immuno-oncology biologics program and is being developed internationally as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers.

The China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has granted tislelizumab in five indications, including full approval for first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy and for first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy; and conditional approval for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL) who received at least two prior therapies, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with PD-L1 high expression whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy, and for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received at least one systemic therapy. Full approval for these indications is contingent upon results from ongoing randomized, controlled confirmatory clinical trials.

In addition, two supplemental Biologics License Applications for tislelizumab have been accepted by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the NMPA and are under review for second- or third-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy and for patients with previously treated, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) solid tumors.

BeiGene has initiated or completed 17 potentially registration-enabling clinical trials in China and globally, including 13 Phase 3 trials and four pivotal Phase 2 trials.

In January 2021, BeiGene and Novartis entered into a collaboration and license agreement granting Novartis rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize tislelizumab in North America, Europe and Japan.

Tislelizumab is not approved for use outside of China.

<p class=""bwalignl"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160), a global biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative medicines worldwide, today announced that the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has accepted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for anti-PD1 antibody tislelizumab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who have disease progression following or are intolerant to first-line standard chemotherapy.</p>
“We are excited to submit the eighth marketing application for tislelizumab, of which five have been approved in China. As the first global Phase 3 ESCC clinical trial, the differences in clinical practice in various countries and regions have been fully taken into account, which indicates the result is fully globally representative.” commented Yong (Ben) Ben, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Immuno-Oncology at BeiGene. “The results demonstrated improved efficacy of tislelizumab monotherapy over chemotherapy in second-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic ESCC and the potential to benefit patients with improved overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy. We look forward to further communication with CDE and hope this medicine will benefit Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic ESCC soon.”

The sBLA is supported by clinical results from a randomized, open-label, multi-center, global Phase 3 clinical trial RATIONALE 302 (NCT03430843) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab as a second-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic ESCC compared to chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of this trial is overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population; a key secondary endpoint is OS in patients with high PD-L1 expression (defined as visually-estimated combined positive score [vCPS] =10%); and other secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and safety. A total of 512 patients were enrolled in the trial in 11 countries and regions in Asia, Europe, and North America, randomized 1:1 to either tislelizumab arm or chemotherapy arm (investigator’s choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan). Results of this trial were presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.

<b>About Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)</b>

Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the digestive tract. As the country with a high incidence of esophageal cancer, China accounts for 53.7% of the world's new cases and 55.7% of the world's deaths every year<sup>i</sup>. Esophageal cancer is mainly divided into squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma, among which adenocarcinoma is the dominant cancer in European and American countries, accounting for about 70% of the overall incidence. In China, more than 95% of patients are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma<sup>ii.</sup>

AstraZeneca’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for tezepelumab has been accepted and granted Priority Review for the treatment of asthma from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Tezepelumab is being developed by AstraZeneca in collaboration with Amgen.

The FDA grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that offer significant advantages over available options by demonstrating safety or efficacy improvements, preventing serious conditions, or enhancing patient compliance.<sup>1</sup> The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for their regulatory decision, is during the first quarter of 2022.

Despite recent advances in severe asthma, many patients may not qualify for or respond well to current biologic medicines.<sup>2-5</sup> Patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma experience frequent exacerbations, significant limitations on lung function and a reduced quality of life.<sup>2,6,7</sup>

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “This decision brings us a step closer to delivering a much-needed, first-in-class medicine for asthma patients, many of whom remain uncontrolled and at risk of asthma attacks despite the availability of inhaled and biologic medicines. Tezepelumab has demonstrated reductions in exacerbations irrespective of blood eosinophil counts, allergy status and fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and has the potential to transform treatment for a broad population of severe asthma patients.”

The BLA was based on results from the PATHFINDER clinical trials programme, including results from the pivotal NAVIGATOR Phase III trial. In NAVIGATOR, tezepelumab demonstrated superiority across every primary and key secondary endpoint, compared to placebo, in a broad population of patients with uncontrolled asthma while receiving treatment with medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus at least one additional controller medicine with or without oral corticosteroids (OCS).<sup>8</sup>

There were no clinically meaningful differences in safety results between the tezepelumab and placebo groups in the NAVIGATOR trial.<sup>8</sup> The most frequently reported adverse events with tezepelumab were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and headache.<sup>8</sup>

Results from the NAVIGATOR Phase III trial were published in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034975"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a><i> </i>in May 2021.

Tezepelumab received <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/investor-relations/stock-exchange-announcements/2018/tezepelumab-granted-breakthrough-therapy-designation-by-us-fda-07092018.html#modal-historic-confirmation"">Breakthrough Therapy Designation</a> for patients with severe asthma, without an eosinophilic phenotype in September 2018.

<b>Severe asthma
</b>Asthma is a heterogeneous disease affecting an estimated 339 million people worldwide.<sup>6,9 </sup>Approximately 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma.<sup>2,6</sup> Despite the use of inhaled asthma controller medicine, currently available biologic therapies and oral corticosteroids (OCS), many severe asthma patients remain uncontrolled.<sup>2,3,6</sup> Due to the complexity of severe asthma, many patients have unclear or multiple drivers of inflammation and may not qualify for or respond well to a current biologic medicine.<sup>2-5</sup>

Severe, uncontrolled asthma is debilitating with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations, significant limitations on lung function and a reduced quality of life.<sup>2,6,7 </sup>Patients with severe asthma are at an increased risk of mortality and compared to patients with persistent asthma have twice the risk of asthma-related hospitalisations.<sup>10-12</sup> There is also a significant socio-economic burden, with these patients accounting for 50% of asthma-related costs.<sup>13</sup>

<b>Clinical trials
</b>Building on the Phase IIb PATHWAY trial, the Phase III PATHFINDER programme included two trials, NAVIGATOR<sup>8,14</sup> and SOURCE.<sup>15,16 </sup>The programme includes additional planned mechanistic and long-term safety trials.<sup>17-19</sup>

NAVIGATOR is a Phase III, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in adults (18–80 years old) and adolescents (12–17 years old) with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were receiving standard of care (SoC). SoC was treatment with medium- or high-dose ICS plus at least one additional controller medicine with or without OCS. The trial population included approximately equal proportions of patients with high (= 300 cells/µL) and low (&lt; 300 cells/µL) blood eosinophil counts. The trial comprised a five to six week screening period, a 52-week treatment period and a 12-week post-treatment follow-up period. All patients received their prescribed controller medicines without change throughout the trial.<sup>8</sup>

The primary efficacy endpoint was the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) during the 52-week treatment period. Key secondary endpoints included the effect of tezepelumab on lung function, asthma control and health-related quality of life.<sup>8</sup>

<div class=""image section""></div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">

As part of prespecified analyses, the AAER over 52 weeks was also assessed in patients grouped by baseline blood eosinophil count, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level, serum specific immunoglobin E (IgE) status (perennial allergen sensitivity positive or negative).<sup>8</sup> These are inflammatory biomarkers used by clinicians to inform treatment options and involve tests analysing a patient’s blood (eosinophils/IgE) and exhaled air (FeNO).

There were no clinically meaningful differences in safety results between the tezepelumab and placebo groups in the NAVIGATOR trial.<sup>8</sup> The most frequently reported adverse events for tezepelumab were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and headache.<sup>8</sup>

NAVIGATOR is the first Phase III trial to show benefit in severe asthma irrespective of eosinophils by targeting thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).<sup>8</sup> These results support the <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/investor-relations/stock-exchange-announcements/2018/tezepelumab-granted-breakthrough-therapy-designation-by-us-fda-07092018.html#modal-historic-confirmation"">US Food and Drug Administration Breakthrough Therapy Designation</a> granted to tezepelumab in September 2018 for patients with severe asthma, without an eosinophilic phenotype.

SOURCE is a Phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial for 48 weeks in adult patients with severe asthma who require continuous treatment with ICS plus long-acting beta2-agonists, and chronic treatment with maintenance OCS therapy. The primary endpoint is the categorised percentage reduction from baseline in the daily OCS dose, while not losing asthma control.<sup>16</sup>

Patients who participated in the NAVIGATOR and SOURCE trials were eligible to continue in DESTINATION, a Phase III extension trial assessing long-term safety and efficacy.<sup>17</sup>

<b>Tezepelumab
</b>Tezepelumab is a potential first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of TSLP, a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and is critical in the initiation and persistence of allergic, eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma.<sup>20,21</sup> TSLP is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations, including allergens, viruses and other airborne particles.<sup>20,21</sup> Expression of TSLP is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity.<sup>20,22</sup> Blocking TSLP may prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control.<sup>20,22 </sup>Tezepelumab acts at the top of the inflammation cascade and has the potential to help address a broad population of severe asthma patients regardless of their type of inflammation.<sup>20,22</sup>

<b>Amgen collaboration
</b>In 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated a <a href=""https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/astrazeneca/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=1343&amp;newsid=665331"" rel=""link-confirmation"">2012 collaboration agreement</a> for tezepelumab. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid single-digit inventor royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca continues to lead development and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies. Under the amended agreement in North America, Amgen and AstraZeneca will jointly commercialise tezepelumab; Amgen will record sales in the US and AstraZeneca will record sales in Canada. AstraZeneca’s share of gross profits from tezepelumab in the US will be recognised as collaboration revenue. In all countries outside the US and Canada, AstraZeneca will solely commercialise tezepelumab. AstraZeneca will record all sales outside of the US as product sales and recognise Amgen’s share of gross profit as cost of sales.

KYPROLIS is licensed to BeiGene in China under a strategic collaboration with Amgen. This is the first approval for KYPROLIS in China.

“Multiple myeloma is an incurable and highly recurrent hematological malignancy. Unfortunately, the clinical needs of patients in China with this disease have yet to be fully satisfied,” commented Xiaobin Wu, Ph.D., President, Chief Operating Officer, and General Manager of China at BeiGene. “The approval of KYPROLIS provides us with an important opportunity to offer adult patients in China with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma a proteasome inhibitor with high selectivity and irreversibility as a treatment option for their disease. With a commercial organization of more than 2,200 people in China we are excited to add KYPROLIS to our product portfolio, which now includes eight approved cancer treatments.”

The conditional approval of KYPROLIS was based on results from the Phase 3 trial (NCT03029234) in China evaluating the efficacy and safety of KYPROLIS<sup> </sup>plus dexamethasone in 123 patients with R/R multiple myeloma. Results of the trial showed that the efficacy in Chinese patients who had received a median of four prior lines of therapy were generally consistent with that seen in the global studies. The overall response rate, the primary endpoint, was 35.8% (95% CI: 27.3, 44.9). The median progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) was 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.6, 6.5). The safety profile observed for Chinese patients in this study was consistent with that observed in the global studies evaluating KYPROLIS in R/R multiple myeloma. In global studies, the most common adverse reactions in the combination therapy trials were anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, thrombocytopenia, cough, dyspnea, and insomnia. No new safety risks were identified based on analyses of adverse events in Chinese patients. Full approval is subject to results of a confirmatory trial.

<b>About Multiple Myeloma</b>

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of the white blood cell, which accumulates in bone marrow and interrupts normal cell function and processes<sup>1</sup>. It is the second most common hematologic malignancy, accounting for ~1% of all cancers and 13% of hematologic cancers<sup>2,3,4</sup>. MM is often diagnosed in later stages and nearly 20% of patients may experience disease reoccurrence or relapse after initial treatment<sup>5,6</sup>. It is estimated that there were 16,500 new cases and 10,300 deaths due to MM in China during 2016, with a higher prevalence in males and older adults ages 55 and 74 years old<sup>6,7,8</sup>. Uncontrolled MM leads to complications including pathologic fractures and anemia.

<b>About KYPROLIS<sup>®</sup> (carfilzomib) for injection</b>

Proteasomes play an important role in cell function and growth by breaking down proteins that are damaged or no longer needed. KYPROLIS has been shown to block proteasomes, leading to an excessive build-up of proteins within cells. In some cells, KYPROLIS can cause cell death, especially in myeloma cells because they are more likely to contain a higher amount of abnormal proteins.

Since its first approval in 2012, approximately 150,000 patients worldwide have received KYPROLIS. KYPROLIS is approved in the U.S. for the following:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three lines of therapy in combination with
<ul class=""bwlistcircle"">
 	<li>Lenalidomide and dexamethasone; or</li>
 	<li>Dexamethasone; or</li>
 	<li>Daratumumab and dexamethasone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>as a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more lines of therapy.</li>
</ul>
KYPROLIS is also approved in countries or regions including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, European Union, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Macao, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Oman, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, S.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Verge Genomics, a biotech company that has created an industry leading all-in-human, artificial-intelligence-powered drug discovery and development platform focused on therapies for serious genetic diseases, today announced a three-year collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company to research and develop novel therapies for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating motor neuron disease.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“Verge Genomics is advancing an innovative approach to identifying high-potential drug targets that are validated through artificial intelligence algorithms and a large library of human data,” said Michael Hutton, VP Neurodegeneration Research at Lilly. “This approach complements and enhances Lilly’s neuroscience portfolio and will help facilitate development of what we hope will be transformative new therapies for people with ALS.”

Under the terms of the three-year agreement, Verge will receive up to $25 million in upfront, equity investment and potential near-term payments, with additional milestone value of $694 million and potential downstream royalties.

The average life expectancy of a person with ALS is approximately two to five years, and there is currently no cure for the disease. One of the biggest challenges in the treatment of ALS is the underlying complex biology and lack of predictive animal models. Recent advances in genetic sequencing and human tissue banking offer a new opportunity to develop breakthrough therapies. Artificial intelligence allows the processing and integration of multiple types of human data generated by these technologies and is uniquely poised to address diseases with complex biology, such as ALS.

In this collaboration, Verge will apply its all-in-human platform to discover and validate new targets for ALS. The all-in-human platform is based on a proprietary collection of patient brain transcriptomes across a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Through its application, the all-in-human platform provides insights into novel causal disease mechanisms in genetically segmented patient populations, and enables the discovery of therapeutic targets. Based on these insights, Verge will apply its human-based discovery capabilities to validate targets. Lilly will select up to four targets identified by Verge with plans to advance through clinical development and commercialization.

“Lilly's focus and leadership in neurology matches well with Verge's ability to identify high-potential targets for devastating neurological diseases. Through this partnership with Lilly, we will examine the use of human data and machine learning to potentially overcome translational hurdles in historically challenging diseases with complex biology,” commented Alice Zhang, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, Verge Genomics. “This collaboration also builds on the significant momentum for Verge in 2021, as we advance our wholly-owned lead PIKFyve programs for ALS and COVID-19, and continue to expand our discovery and pipeline development efforts in disease areas with significant unmet need.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., July 08, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vor Biopharma (Nasdaq: VOR or the Company), a cell therapy company pioneering engineered hematopoietic stem cell (eHSC) therapies combined with targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer, today announced the formation of a collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson. The agreement was facilitated by Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation.

Under the terms of the collaboration, Vor Biopharma will investigate the combination of these two technologies into a treatment solution, pairing Vor’s “invisible” eHSC transplant platform with one of Janssen’s bi-specific antibodies in development for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

“We are thrilled to enter into this collaboration with Janssen as we continue to explore our platform’s potential to pair with a broad spectrum of targeted therapy modalities for the treatment of patients with blood cancer,” said Tirtha Chakraborty, PhD, Vor’s Chief Scientific Officer. “We believe this unique combination will leverage each technology’s strengths, while protecting patients against off-target effects of these powerful immunotherapies.”

The collaboration agreement provides that each company retains all rights and ownership to their respective programs and platforms.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","DUBLIN, July 7, 2021 /CNW/ – Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ: JAZZ) today announced the Health Canada approval and availability of Vyxeos® (daunorubicin and cytarabine liposome for injection) for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related AML (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC).1

AML, a cancer of the bone marrow and the blood, progresses rapidly without treatment.2 Specifically, high-risk AML includes t-AML and AML-MRC.3 T-AML is caused by previous therapeutic treatments while AML-MRC occurs when there are certain changes in the bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside the bones.1

Considered a rare disease, AML affects approximately 1,100 men and women in Canada annually.4  Though the number of AML cases has continued to rise5, the current treatment regimen for patients with high-risk AML has remained the same for decades until now.6 

“Vyxeos is not only an effective treatment option but a significant advance by providing this patient population with a chemotherapy agent that takes less time to administer and provides a better chance at survival than our standard current treatment for high-risk AML,” said Dr. Brian Leber, clinical hematologist, Juravinski Cancer Centre, Hamilton Health Sciences in Hamilton, Ontario. “Having more time is a substantial win for these patients and their families.”

The approval of Vyxeos is based on results from a Phase 3 study of 309 adult patients, aged 60-75, with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC.1 The study met its primary endpoint as Vyxeos demonstrated a superior improvement in overall survival compared to the current conventional treatment group.1 The median overall survival for the Vyxeos treatment group was 9.6 months compared with 6.0 months for the current conventional treatment group.1

The most common adverse reactions (= 10% Incidence) attributed to Vyxeos are infection, febrile neutropenia, rash, transfusion reactions, sleep disorders, anxiety, delirium, headache, dizziness, visual impairment, non-conduction cardiotoxicity, arrhythmia, chest pain, hemorrhage, hypotension, hypertension, dyspnea, cough, pleural effusion, hypoxia, nausea, diarrhea/ colitis, mucositis, constipation, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, vomiting, hemorrhoids, pruritus, petechiae, musculoskeletal pain, renal insufficiency, edema, fatigue, chills, pyrexia and catheter/device/ injection site reaction.1

“As a company dedicated to bringing life-changing medicines to market and redefining possibilities, the approval of Vyxeos in Canada represents Jazz’s promise of putting patients first,” said Paul Petrelli, general manager, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. “Vyxeos is an important example of how we meet the needs of the hematology and the oncology communities by offering a treatment that may extend life for high-risk AML patients.”

Vyxeos is part of a group of medicines called “antineoplastics” used against cancer.1 It contains two medicinal ingredients, daunorubicin and cytarabine,1 which are packaged in tiny particles known as liposomes.1 Vyxeos is believed to kill cancer cells by stopping them from growing and dividing.1 Packaging the medicinal ingredients in liposomes allows the drug to stay longer in the body.1 The liposomes packaging also helps the drug enter the body and kill the cancer cells.1

About Vyxeos
Vyxeos (daunorubicin and cytarabine liposome for injection) is a chemotherapy treatment option specifically indicated for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC).1
Vyxeos is administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 90 minutes.1

Vyxeos liposomes accumulate and persist in the bone marrow where they are taken up intact by leukemia cells to a greater extent than by non-leukemic bone marrow cells based on in-vivo animal studies.7

It is the first product to be developed with Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ CombiPlex® technology platform, which uniquely enables the design, rapid evaluation and delivery of various combinations of therapies.8

Important Safety Information for Canada1
Vyxeos should not be given to patients who are:

allergic to daunorubicin or cytarabine, or to any of the other ingredients of this drug.
Vyxeos must be prescribed and administered to patients by specialized physicians experienced in the use of chemotherapeutic medicinal products.” The most common side effects of Vyxeos are infection, febrile neutropenia, rash, transfusion reactions, sleep disorders, anxiety, delirium, headache, dizziness, visual impairment, non-conduction cardiotoxicity, arrhythmia, chest pain, hemorrhage, hypotension, hypertension, dyspnea, cough, pleural effusion, hypoxia, nausea, diarrhea/ colitis, mucositis, constipation, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, vomiting, hemorrhoids, pruritus, petechiae, musculoskeletal pain, renal insufficiency, edema, fatigue, chills, pyrexia and catheter/device/ injection site reaction.1

Vyxeos has different dosing directions than daunorubicin hydrochloride injection, cytarabine injection, daunorubicin citrate liposome injection and cytarabine liposome injection. Your healthcare professional will make sure you are getting the right drug and dose before giving you Vyxeos. If you think you may have received a different drug than usual, talk with your healthcare professional.

About AML2
AML is a rare type of blood cancer that begins in the bone marrow and blood. It damages the DNA (genetic material) of a developing stem cell in the bone marrow. This is called an “acquired mutation.” Stem cells form blood cells (red cells, white cells and platelets). This damaged cell becomes a leukemic cell and multiplies into billions of cells called leukemic blasts that block the production of normal cells.

As a result, the number of healthy blood cells (red cells, white cells and platelets) is usually lower than normal and are crowded out by cancer or leukemic cells. The median age at diagnosis is 67. Symptoms may include but are not limited to pale skin, bruises with no clear cause and an enlarged liver or spleen. There is no known cause for most cases of AML.

Lysogene (Paris:LYS) (FR0013233475 – LYS), a gene therapy platform Company targeting central nervous system (CNS) diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation to its LYS-GM101 program, which is being studied in the recently initiated global adaptative-design clinical trial for the treatment of GM1 gangliosidosis. GM1 gangliosidosis is a fatal autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the GLB1 gene leading to accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in neurons resulting in progressive neurodegeneration. No treatment has been approved so far for this disease.

<b>Karen Aiach, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lysogene </b>commented: <i>“We are pleased that FDA has granted Fast Track designation to LYS-GM101, as it underscores its potential to improve neurocognitive deficits in children with GM1 gangliosidosis, a lethal neurological disease for which there is currently no treatment. We have dosed the first patient last month and recruitment is on track, with completion of the first cohort expected by first quarter next year”.</i>

The Fast Track program facilitates the development and accelerates the review of new drugs for serious conditions, which have the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose is to expedite the availability of new treatment options for patients. A product that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for more frequent interactions with FDA, potential eligibility for accelerated approval, priority review, and rolling Biologics License Application (BLA) review.

<i>“This Fast Track designation demonstrates the regulators’ sustained interest in Lysogene’s cutting edge gene therapy program. It complements the Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations granted by the FDA in 2016 and 2017” </i>added <strong>Marie Deneux, Chief Regulatory Officer</strong> <b>of Lysogene</b>. <i>“We look forward to working closely with the agency in our effort to develop LYS-GM101 as the potential first drug for the treatment of GM1 gangliosidosis.”</i>

The trial is an interventional, multi-center, single-arm, two-stage adaptive-design study evaluating an intracisternally delivered recombinant adeno-associated virus vector serotype rh.10 (AAVrh.10) carrying the human ß-galactosidase gene (GBL1) (NCT04273269). The clinical trial includes a safety phase and a confirmatory efficacy phase. The trial will enroll 16 patients with a diagnosis of early or late infantile GM1 gangliosidosis at sites in the US and Europe. More information can be found on <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov&amp;esheet=52457150&amp;newsitemid=20210708005673&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.clinicaltrials.gov&amp;index=1&amp;md5=9f6f169afc2fcd8cd798d861ccbfe218"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>.

Lysogene is also funding a GM1 gangliosidosis natural history study being conducted by Casimir Trials to collect prospective and/or retrospective videos of children doing certain everyday tasks and behaviors (NCT04310163).

<b>Berlin, July 9</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b>, 2021</b> – Bayer announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved finerenone, the first non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, under the brand name Kerendia<sup>®</sup>. Finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg is indicated to reduce the risk of sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

The approval of finerenone by the FDA is based on the positive results of the pivotal Phase III FIDELIO-DKD study, presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s (ASN) Kidney Week Reimagined 2020 and simultaneously published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> in October 2020, and follows Priority Review designation granted by the FDA in January 2021.

“There are more than 160 million patients living with CKD and T2D worldwide. Even when blood glucose levels and blood pressure are well-controlled, patients still remain at risk of CKD progression. This means there is a high unmet medical need for early intervention to prevent further end-organ damage and premature death by slowing patients’ rate of decline in kidney function as well as reducing cardiovascular risk,” said Professor George L. Bakris, MD, Department of Medicine, American Heart Association Comprehensive Hypertension Center, University of Chicago Medicine, USA and principal investigator of the FIDELIO-DKD trial. “The approval of finerenone offers a new path to protect patients from further kidney damage through addressing MR overactivation, a key driver of CKD progression, which is unaddressed by currently available therapies.”

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and potentially deadly condition that is generally underrecognized. CKD can shorten life expectancy of patients with type 2 diabetes by up to 16 years, relative to the general population living without either disease. Up to 40% of all patients with type 2 diabetes develop chronic kidney disease. In T2D, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation is thought to contribute to CKD progression which can be driven by metabolic, haemodynamic or inflammation and fibrosis factors.

“The Phase III FIDELIO-DKD trial is the first large contemporary positive outcomes study in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) with a primary composite endpoint consisting exclusively of kidney-specific outcomes. It is also part of the largest global Phase III clinical trial program to date in CKD and T2D,” said Dr. Michael Devoy, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Medical Affairs and Pharmacovigilance at Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals Division. “With our longstanding expertise in innovative science in the cardiovascular space, today’s approval of finerenone marks an important milestone in Bayer’s commitment to improving the lives of patients with kidney and cardiovascular diseases.”

Finerenone has also been submitted for marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) and in China, as well as multiple other countries worldwide and these applications are currently under review.

<b>About Finerenone</b>
Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is a novel, non-steroidal, selective antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) that has been shown to block harmful effects of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation. In T2D, MR overactivation is thought to contribute to CKD progression and cardiovascular damage which can be driven by metabolic, haemodynamic or inflammation and fibrosis factors.

Having randomized more than 13,000 patients with CKD and T2D around the world, the Phase III programme with finerenone in CKD and T2D comprises two studies, evaluating the effect of finerenone versus placebo on top of standard of care on both renal and cardiovascular outcomes.

The clinical data from FIGARO-DKD are scheduled for presentation at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2021 on August 28th.

Bayer also recently announced the initiation of the FINEARTS-HF study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study which will investigate finerenone compared to placebo in more than 5,500 symptomatic heart failure patients (New York Heart Association class II-IV) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of =40%. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of finerenone over placebo in reducing the rate of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure (HF) events (defined as hospitalizations for HF or urgent HF visits).

<b>About Chronic Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetes</b>
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a potentially deadly condition that is generally underrecognized. CKD is one of the most frequent complications arising from diabetes and is also an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. Up to 40% of all patients with type 2 diabetes develop CKD. Despite guideline-directed therapies, patients with CKD and T2D remain at high risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events. It is estimated that CKD affects more than 160 million people with T2D worldwide. CKD in T2D is the main cause of end stage kidney disease, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive.

<strong>OSAKA, Japan, July 10, 2021 –</strong> Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited <strong>(</strong>TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK<strong>)</strong> (“Takeda”) today announced results from two final analyses from the Phase 3 HELP (Hereditary Angioedema Long-term Prophylaxis) Study<sup>™</sup> Open-label Extension (OLE), which evaluated the long-term safety (primary endpoint) and efficacy of TAKHZYRO<sup><strong>®</strong></sup> (lanadelumab) 300 mg every two weeks for up to 2.5 years. In the first analysis, the mean (min, max) reduction in the attack rate compared to baseline observed in the study population (N=212) was of 87.4 percent (-100; 852.8), and the median reduction was 97.7 percent and patients received treatment for a mean (standard deviation) duration of 29.6 (8.2) months.<sup>1</sup> At steady state – day 70 to the end of the treatment period – attack rates were further reduced to a mean of 92.4 percent and a median reduction of 98.2 percent.<sup>2,3</sup> An additional analysis further suggests TAKHZYRO was a well-tolerated treatment that prevented HAE attacks over an extended planned 132 week treatment period across specific HAE patient demographic and disease characteristic subgroups.<sup>3</sup> These data are being presented at the 2021 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Hybrid Congress in Krakow, Poland and Madrid, Spain.

<em> </em>“Hereditary angioedema is a lifelong condition and research shows that concerns about another attack can limit the way patients lead their lives,” said Prof. Markus Magerl, M.D., Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, Charité – Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, Germany. “The efficacy of TAKHZYRO to prevent HAE attacks over the long term will be an important consideration for patients and physicians as they develop a treatment plan for patients that is focused on reducing the number of HAE attacks.”

The original Phase 3 HELP Study was conducted in 125 patients aged 12 years and older over 26 weeks, making it the largest randomized, controlled prevention study in HAE, with the longest active treatment duration, to date.<sup>4</sup> The HELP Study OLE was designed to evaluate the long-term safety (primary endpoint) and efficacy of TAKHZYRO for up to 2.5 years. The complete results were based on data collected between May 2016 and October 2019 and included 109 rollover patients who were originally evaluated in the HELP Study, and 103 eligible non-rollover patients who did not participate in the initial study but had experienced at least one HAE attack within the previous 12 weeks.<sup>1</sup>
<h4>Attack-free status during steady state of lanadelumab treatment in patients with hereditary angioedema: findings from the HELP open-label extension study (Electronic Poster Presentation: Abstract #342)</h4>
Results from the HELP Study OLE found that TAKHZYRO sustained efficacy in the prevention of HAE attacks by reducing attack rates in a treatment period of up to 132 weeks. TAKHZYRO, which has a half-life of approximately 14 days, is expected to reach steady state at approximately 70 days. The HELP Study OLE analysis of attack-free status during the steady state period showed that the efficacy of TAKHZYRO 300 mg administered subcutaneously every two weeks in rollover patients was consistent with the original findings from the HELP Study.<sup>2</sup>

The mean (min, max) reduction in the attack rate compared to baseline observed in the study population (N=212) was of 87.4 percent (-100; 852.8), and the median reduction was 97.7 percent (98.0 percent rollovers, 96.9 percent non-rollovers).<sup>1,2</sup> At steady state, attack rates were further reduced to a mean of 92.4 percent (-100, 0.44) comprised of 92.7 percent rollovers (-100, -40.9) and 91.9 percent non-rollovers (-100, 0.44) and a median reduction of 98.2 percent (98.4 percent rollovers, 97.3 percent non-rollovers). During the first six months of treatment after day 70 during the steady-state period, 58.6 percent of patients (n=119) were attack-free, 54.7 percent rollovers and 62.9 percent non-rollovers. The maximum duration of attack-free period after day 70 = 6 months was 83.7 percent and = 12 months was 70 percent. The means of the average and maximum duration of attack-free period during steady state were 14.8 and 18.6 months, respectively, with 70.0 percent of patients (n=142) having a maximum duration of attack-free period greater than 12 months.<sup>2</sup>
<h4>Long-term prevention of attacks with lanadelumab across subgroups of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE): final results from the HELP open-label extension study (Oral Presentation: Abstract #392)</h4>
In a further HELP Study OLE analysis, treatment with TAKHZYRO 300 mg every two weeks was well-tolerated and effectively reduced attack rates over an extended treatment period across different patient demographic and disease characteristics, including patient age, gender, race, HAE type, body mass index, history of long-term prophylaxis use, and baseline attack rate.<sup>3</sup>

The safety profile of TAKHZYRO was comparable across all evaluated subgroups with treatment-related TEAEs occurring in 54.7 percent of patients (n=116) and the most common being injection-site pain.<sup>3</sup>

“For more than a decade, we’ve listened to the HAE community to further understand the need for long-term, preventive targeted therapies and have committed our resources to developing treatment options,” said Neil Inhaber, M.D., Vice President, Global Medical Head, HAE and Transplant at Takeda. “These analyses further assert the important role TAKHZYRO can play in the lives of people who live with HAE.”
<h4>About The HELP Study<sup>™ </sup>Open-label Extension</h4>
The HELP (Hereditary Angioedema Long-term Prophylaxis) Study<sup>™</sup> Open-label Extension (OLE) is an evaluation of the long-term efficacy and safety of TAKHZYRO in hereditary angioedema (HAE) patients of at least 12 years of age and older. Two hundred and twelve patients received treatment with TAKHZYRO at the start of the OLE Study (109 rollover patients originally evaluated in the HELP Study and who continued into the OLE, and 103 eligible patients who did not participate in the HELP Study but who had experienced at least one attack in the last 12 weeks). Rollover patients received a dose of 300 mg TAKHZYRO on Day 0 and then every two weeks after their first attack. Non-rollover patients were treated with one 300 mg dose every two weeks, beginning on Day 0. One hundred and ninety-six participants completed at least 12 months of treatment and 173 participants completed at least 30 months of treatment.<sup>1</sup>
<h4>About Hereditary Angioedema</h4>
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder that results in recurring attacks of oedema – swelling – in various parts of the body, including the abdomen, face, feet, genitals, hands and throat. The swelling can be debilitating and painful.<sup>5,6,7</sup> Attacks that obstruct the airways can cause asphyxiation and are potentially life threatening.<sup>7,8</sup><sup> </sup>HAE affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. It is often under recognized, under diagnosed and under treated.<sup>5,7,8</sup>
<h4>Takeda in Hereditary Angioedema</h4>
Hereditary Angioedema (HAE), like so many other rare diseases, is highly complex, and patients, their families and caregivers often undergo years of strain trying to understand their disease, get a definitive diagnosis and gain access to the medicines they need. At Takeda we are a committed champion for the patients we serve. Every individual living with HAE is unique and by listening and reacting to their needs, we translate the insights we gain into innovative solutions – from diagnosis to ongoing management. Advancing the science is crucial to the way we operate and we are bold in our mission to accelerate diagnosis and develop treatments that will make a difference to the lives of HAE patients, their support networks and those medical professionals who care for them.
<h4>About TAKHZYRO<sup>®</sup> (lanadelumab)</h4>
TAKHZYRO<sup>®</sup> (lanadelumab) is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks HAE in patients aged 12 years and older. TAKHZYRO is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds and decreases plasma kallikrein activity. TAKHZYRO is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.<sup>9</sup>

TAKHZYRO is formulated for subcutaneous administration and has a half-life of approximately two weeks in patients with HAE. TAKHZYRO is intended for the self-administration or administration by a caregiver, only after training by a healthcare professional.<sup>9</sup>

TAKHZYRO is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks.<sup>9</sup>

<sup> </sup>Depending on regional marketing authorization, TAKHZYRO is available as a 300 mg dose in a vial or pre-filled syringe. Please consult local prescribing information for more information.
<h4>TAKHZYRO Safety Information for Europe</h4>
Please consult the <a href=""https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/takhzyro-epar-product-information_en.pdf"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/takhzyro-epar-product-information_en.pdf"" data-action=""External"">TAKHZYRO Summary Product Characteristics (SmPC)</a> before prescribing.

TAKHZYRO treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). TAKHZYRO may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver only after training on SC injection technique by a healthcare professional.<sup>9</sup>
<h4>Contraindication</h4>
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.<sup>9</sup>
<h4>Warnings and Precautions</h4>
Traceability: In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.<sup>9</sup>

Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed. In case of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, administration of TAKHZYRO must be stopped immediately and appropriate treatment must be initiated.<sup>9</sup>

General: TAKHZYRO is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks. In case of a breakthrough HAE attack, individualized treatment should be initiated with an approved rescue medication. There are no available clinical data on the use of lanadelumab in HAE patients with normal C1-INH activity.<sup>9</sup>

Interference with coagulation test: Lanadelumab can increase activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to an interaction of lanadelumab with the aPTT assay. The reagents used in the aPTT laboratory test initiate intrinsic coagulation through the activation of plasma kallikrein in the contact system. Inhibition of plasma kallikrein by lanadelumab can increase aPTT in this assay. None of the increases in aPTT in patients treated with TAKHZYRO were associated with abnormal bleeding adverse events. There were no differences in international normalised ratio (INR) between treatment groups.<sup>9</sup>

Sodium content: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.<sup>9</sup>
<h4>Interactions</h4>
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on the characteristics of lanadelumab, no pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered medicinal products is expected.<sup>9</sup>

As expected, concomitant use of the rescue medication C1 esterase inhibitor results in an additive effect on lanadelumab-cHMWK response based on the mechanism of action (MOA) of lanadelumab and C1 esterase inhibitor.<sup>9</sup>
<h4>Immunogenicity</h4>
Treatment with lanadelumab has been associated with development of treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in 11.9% (10/84) of subjects. All antibody titres were low. The ADA response was transient in 20% (2/10) of ADA positive subjects. 2.4% (2/84) of lanadelumab-treated subjects tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.<sup>9</sup>

The development of ADA including neutralising antibodies against TAKHZYRO did not appear to adversely affect the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles or clinical response.<sup>9</sup>
<h4>Adverse Reactions</h4>
The most commonly observed adverse reaction (52.4%) associated with TAKHZYRO was injection site reactions (ISR) including injection site pain, injection site erythema and injection site bruising. Of these ISRs, 97% were of mild intensity, 90% resolved within 1 day after onset with a median duration of 6 minutes.<sup>9</sup>

Hypersensitivity reaction (mild and moderate pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue) was observed (1.2%)

<strong>TOKYO and BOTHELL, Wash.– July 9, 2021 -- </strong>Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) and Seagen Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted PADCEV<sup>®</sup> (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) regular approval in the U.S., in addition to approving a new indication for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and have previously received one or more prior lines of therapy. Cisplatin-ineligible patients typically have limited treatment options and a poor prognosis.

In 2019, the FDA granted accelerated approval for PADCEV for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and a platinum-containing chemotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery, or in a locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer setting. The conversion from accelerated approval to regular approval and the label expansion were based on two supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLAs) reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program.

“The FDA’s decision to convert accelerated approval to regular approval was based on data from the Phase 3 EV-301 trial, which had a primary endpoint of overall survival for patients treated with PADCEV versus chemotherapy,” said Andrew Krivoshik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Oncology Therapeutic Area Head, Astellas. “With PADCEV, for the first time, physicians can treat advanced urothelial cancer following treatment with a platinum-containing therapy and immunotherapy using an FDA-approved therapy that has demonstrated an overall survival benefit compared with chemotherapy.”

The EV-301 trial compared PADCEV to chemotherapy in adult patients (n=608) with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1/L1 inhibitor. At the time of pre-specified interim analysis, patients who received PADCEV (n=301) in the trial lived a median of 3.9 months longer than those who received chemotherapy (n=307). Median overall survival was 12.9 vs. 9.0 months, respectively [Hazard Ratio=0.70 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.56, 0.89), p=0.001]. The most common all-grade adverse reactions (=20%) included rash, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, pruritus, nausea, constipation, dysgeusia, musculoskeletal pain, dry eye, pyrexia, abdominal pain and anemia.

“PADCEV is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have received immunotherapy and cannot receive cisplatin,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Seagen. “Because of the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review, we’re able to make PADCEV available as early as possible to these patients, who have limited treatment options due to their age or comorbid conditions.”

Cohort 2 of the EV-201 trial evaluated PADCEV in patients (n=89) with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who had been previously treated with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor, had not received a platinum-containing chemotherapy in this setting, and were ineligible for cisplatin. After a median follow-up of 16 months, 51 percent of patients who received PADCEV had an objective response [95% CI: 39.8, 61.3] per blinded independent central review, with a median duration of response of 13.8 months [95% CI: 6.4, not reached]. The most common all-grade adverse reactions (=20%) included rash, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, fatigue, decreased appetite, anemia, diarrhea, pruritus, weight decreased, nausea, dry eye and dysgeusia.

“Almost half of advanced bladder cancer patients cannot receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Many of these patients will receive first-line immunotherapy. If their cancer does not respond -- or if it progresses after prior response to immunotherapy -- there is an urgent need for more treatment options as there is currently no standard of care,” said Evan Y. Yu, M.D., Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine and a lead investigator for the EV-201 trial, in which all patients were previously treated with immunotherapy. “A new regulatory approval for enfortumab vedotin is an important clinical advance and can help serve this unmet need.”

Please <strong>see Important Safety Information including BOXED WARNING</strong> at the end of this press release.

Globally, approximately 573,000 new cases of bladder cancer and more than 212,000 deaths are reported annually.<sup>1</sup> PADCEV is the subject of a robust development program aimed at addressing unmet needs across the continuum of urothelial cancer and in other solid tumors.

The FDA’s RTOR program aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. The agency’s review was also conducted as part of Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among participating international health authorities. Through Project Orbis, health authorities in Australia and Canada are continuing to review data from EV-301 and EV-201 for initial registrations.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Astellas-1.jpg,Regulatory,Astellas|Seagen,Padcev|enfortumab vedotin-ejfv,Urothelial Cancer|Regulatory|US FDA|Full approval,publish,12-07-2021,2

<span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span> and SUZHOU, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">July 11, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high-quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 1 study of IBI323, an anti-LAG-3/PD-L1 bispecific antibody.

The objective of this open-label, multi-center Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, potential optimal dosage and preliminary efficacy of IBI323 in patients with advanced malignant tumors whose cancer progressed on standard-of-care treatment. The trial is being conducted in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.

IBI323 is a recombinant LAG-3/PD-L1 bispecific antibody. Preclinical studies showed that IBI323 effectively blocks both the PD-1/PD-L1 and LAG-3 pathways and can generate more effective and durable activation of T lymphocyte activation than the combination of anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody and anti-LAG monoclonal antibody. Besides, through the bridging effect of bispecific antibody, tumor cells expressing PD-L1 can be drawn closer to T lymphocyte expressing LAG-3, thus forming stable TCR: MHC immune synapses and enhancing T lymphocyte activation. Therefore, IBI323 shows advantages compared with two drugs combination according to the mechanism. Recently, an article about IBI323's bispecific antibody enhances tumor-specific immunity was published on <i>Oncolmmunology</i>.

Professor Caicun Zhou, Chief of Oncology Department of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University and Director of Cancer Institute of Tongji University Medical School, stated: ""Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising results in the treatment of a wide range of tumors, there still remains many new challenges. Many patients inevitably develop drugs resistance and the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors needs to be further enhanced. Therefore, it is of great value to develop the next generation of bispecific antibodies. LAG-3 is one of the most promising targets among cancer immunotherapy, combining innovative techniques for bispecific monoclonal antibody, we look forward to the results of IBI323 clinical trials. ""

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Hui Zhou</span>, Senior Vice President of Clinical Development of Innovent, stated: ""The LAG-3/PD-L1 bispecific antibody can specifically target both LAG-3 and PD-L1, block both the PD-1/PD-L1 and LAG-3 pathways, synergically enhance the activity of T lymphocyte and close the distance between tumor cells with high PD-L1 expression and T cells expressing LAG-3. The preclinical results have shown that compared with two monoclonal antibodies, IBI323 can further enhance the immune activation with improved convenience of administration. Therefore, the development of LAG-3/PD-L1 bispecific antibody will provide patients with a novel, comprehensive, effective and cost-saving treatment regimen. We hope that IBI323 will benefit more patients. ""

<p align=""justify""><strong>Mechelen</strong><strong>, Belgium; </strong><strong>10</strong><strong> July 2021, </strong><strong>11</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong> CET; Galapagos NV (Euronext &amp; NASDAQ: GLPG) today announced new </strong><strong>post-hoc </strong><strong>analyses</strong><strong> from the </strong><strong>Phase 3 </strong><strong>SELECTION program, </strong><strong>supporting the </strong><strong>activity and tolerability </strong><strong>of filgotinib, </strong><strong>a</strong><strong> once-daily</strong><strong>, oral </strong><strong>JAK1 preferential inhibitor, </strong><strong>under investigation </strong><strong>for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). These data were presented at the European Crohn’s and Colitis </strong><strong>Organisation</strong><strong> (ECCO) 16th annual congress.</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">A <em>post-hoc</em> analysis of the induction study data from SELECTION showed significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of stool frequency (SF) and of rectal bleeding (RB), that were observed as early as the first week of therapy in patients on 200mg of filgotinib daily versus placebo in patients with moderately to severely active UC. These findings were observed in both biologic-naïve and biologic-experienced patients. More patients receiving filgotinib 200mg versus placebo achieved a composite score of RB=0 and SF=1 as early as day 9 in Induction study A (biologic-naïve; filgotinib 200mg 18.8%, placebo 9.5%, p&lt;0.05) and as early as day 7 in Induction study B (biologic-experienced; filgotinib 200mg 10.7%; placebo 4.2%, p&lt;0.05).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p align=""justify"">A further <em>post-hoc</em> analysis of the SELECTION maintenance study reported the proportion of patients who were steroid-free at different timepoints, before achieving remission at Week 58. These data indicated that filgotinib 200mg reduced and eliminated corticosteroid (CS) use versus placebo at Week 58 in patients with moderately to severely active UC. Compared with placebo, a significantly higher proportion of patients who demonstrated CS-free remission at Week 58 with filgotinib 200mg had been CS-free in the previous six months (27% filgotinib 200mg vs 6% placebo, 95% CI 21 (8, 34), with a difference seen from as early as the previous eight months (22% filgotinib 200mg vs 6% placebo, 95% CI 15 (3, 28)).<sup>2</sup></p>
<p align=""justify"">Additional safety analysis from SELECTION, combining induction, maintenance and the long-term extension study data, with a cumulative treatment exposure of 1,207 patient years for filgotinib 200mg versus 318 patient years for placebo, showed results consistent with the original induction and maintenance trials, where filgotinib was well tolerated in patients with moderately to severely active UC.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p align=""justify"">Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer at Galapagos stated, “Listening to the needs of patients living with moderately and severely active UC, and the healthcare professionals treating them, helps us understand the importance of finding treatments that address both clinical symptoms and patient reported outcomes. These new data from SELECTION and the long-term extension study suggest that patients with moderately to severely active UC have experienced rapid response, sustained steroid-free remission and long-term tolerability when taking filgotinib 200mg versus those on a placebo”.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Ulcerative Colitis</strong>
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that occurs as a result of an abnormal immune system response. Across Europe an estimated 2 million people<sup>4</sup> are affected by IBD, which includes UC and Crohn’s Disease (CD). It is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The disease course of UC is often a state of flare ups and ensuing periods of remission. In addition to the physical impact from flare ups, there is also a significant psychological impact associated with UC, which is further compounded by the perceived stigma of the condition.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the SELECTION Phase 3 Trial</strong>
The SELECTION Phase 3 trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the preferential JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. The SELECTION trial comprises two induction trials and a maintenance trial. The Induction Study A enrolled biologic-naïve patients, and the Induction Study B enrolled biologic-experienced patients.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Across both induction studies, 1348 patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized to receive either filgotinib 200mg, filgotinib 100mg or placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. Moderately to severely active UC was defined as a centrally read endoscopy score = 2, a rectal bleeding score = 1, a stool frequency score = 1 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of = 2 based on the Mayo Clinic Score (MCS). 644 patients with clinical remission or response at Week 10 of induction were subsequently re-randomized to the induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The primary objectives of SELECTION were to evaluate the efficacy of filgotinib compared with placebo in establishing clinical remission as determined by the Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and = 1-point decrease in stool frequency from baseline to achieve a subscore of 0 or 1 at Week 10 in the induction studies and Week 58 in the maintenance study. Eligible patients who were enrolled in the SELECTION trial were enrolled in the ongoing SELECTION long-term extension trial to evaluate the long-term safety of filgotinib in patients with moderately to severely active UC. A majority of patients included in the trials had a MCS of 9 or higher at baseline, and 43% of biologic experienced patients had insufficient response to a TNF antagonist and vedolizumab as well.</p>

<b>SPRING HOUSE, PENNSYLVANIA, July 9, 2021</b> – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced new three-year data from the long-term extension (LTE) of the STELARA<sup>®</sup> (ustekinumab) Phase 3 UNIFI study. The data demonstrated the majority (55.2 percent) of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who initially responded to treatment with STELARA sustained symptomatic remission<sup>a</sup> rates at nearly three years (week 152).<sup>1</sup> Furthermore, a majority (96.4 percent) of the patients in symptomatic remission<sup>a</sup> at week 152 were corticosteroid-free. These data are being presented today as a digital oral presentation (DOP83) at the 16<sup>th</sup> Congress of the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation.<sup>1</sup>

“Despite recent substantial therapeutic gains, many patients living with ulcerative colitis still struggle to find lasting relief from their disease symptoms, especially without the use of steroids that can be associated with debilitating side effects when used long-term,” said Bruce E. Sands, M.D., M.S., Chief of the Dr. Henry D. Janowitz Division of Gastroenterology at Mount Sinai Hospital and the Dr. Burrill B. Crohn Professor of Medicine (Gastroenterology) at the Icahn Institute for Medicine at Mount Sinai.<sup>b</sup> “The LTE of the UNIFI study underscores the importance of studying therapies long-term, with results showing ustekinumab as both an effective and enduring treatment option for patients living with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.”

Of the 348 patients in the intent-to-treat population<sup>c</sup> who had achieved clinical response at maintenance baseline and were randomized to STELARA 90 mg every eight weeks (q8w) or every 12 weeks (q12w):<sup>1</sup>
<ul>
 	<li>55.2 percent of patients were in symptomatic remission<sup>a</sup> at week 152.</li>
 	<li>96.4 percent (185/192) of patients in symptomatic remission<sup>a</sup> at week 152 were not receiving corticosteroids.</li>
</ul>
Of the 248 patients randomized to STELARA 90 mg q8w or q12w <span class=""Link"">at maintenance baseline and treated in the </span>LTE:<sup>1,d</sup>
<ul>
 	<li>67.6 percent of patients were in symptomatic remission<sup>a</sup> at week 152.</li>
 	<li>76.4 percent of patients in clinical remission<sup>e </sup>at week 44 were in symptomatic remission<sup>a</sup> at week 152.</li>
</ul>
Safety was evaluated at week 156 for all patients (n=588) who were treated in the LTE. From maintenance week 0 through week 156, combined STELARA patients and placebo patients had 1,281.6 and 425 patient-years (PYs) of follow-up, respectively. Safety events per 100 PYs of follow-up were as follows: adverse events (AEs) 235.81 for STELARA vs 204.48 for placebo; serious adverse events (SAEs) 7.73 for STELARA vs 7.53 for placebo, and serious infections 2.34 for STELARA vs 2.35 for placebo. No new safety signals were observed.<sup>1,2</sup>

Results from a separate digital oral presentation (DOP86) on corticosteroid-sparing effects within the UNIFI LTE show 91.4 percent of STELARA patients (n=139) receiving corticosteroids at maintenance baseline were no longer receiving corticosteroids at week 152 (patients were randomized to STELARA at the start of the LTE of the study).<sup>3</sup>

“Janssen is relentlessly focused on unmet patient needs and committed to improving the standard of care in ulcerative colitis,” said Jan Wehkamp, M.D., Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. “We are proud to share these long-term data among the gastrointestinal community, especially for patients who are still struggling to manage their disease and achieve remission.”

<b><u>Editor’s Note:</u></b>
a. Symptomatic remission is defined as a Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Symptomatic remission results refer to the STELARA 90 mg q8w and q12w combined group.<sup>1</sup>
b. Dr. Sands is a paid consultant for Janssen. He has not been compensated for any media work.
c. All patients were randomized to STELARA at maintenance baseline with non-responder importation (NRI) and treatment failure criteria.<sup>1</sup>
d. Included treatment failure and missing data utilizing NRI.<sup>1</sup>
e. Clinical remission is defined as a Mayo score =2 points, with no individual subscore &gt;1.<sup>1</sup>

<b><u>About the UNIFI Trial</u><sup>4</sup></b>
UNIFI is a Phase 3 protocol designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of STELARA induction and maintenance dosing for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC in adults who demonstrated an inadequate response to or were unable to tolerate conventional (i.e., corticosteroids, immunomodulators) or biologic (i.e., one or more TNF blockers or vedolizumab) therapies. Both the induction and maintenance studies are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-center studies.

The induction study was of at least eight weeks duration for each participant. Participants achieving clinical response in the induction study were eligible for the maintenance study. The maintenance study was 44 weeks duration. The primary endpoint of the induction study was clinical remission at week eight, and the primary endpoint for the maintenance study was clinical remission at week 44 among responders to a single intravenous (IV) STELARA infusion. 523 IV STELARA induction responders were randomized to subcutaneous (SC) maintenance therapy (175 SC placebo; 172 STELARA 90 mg q12w; 176 STELARA 90 mg q8w). 284 STELARA patients who completed week 44 entered the LTE. Randomized placebo patients were discontinued after week 44 unblinding. Starting at week 56, randomized patients with UC worsening could adjust to q8w dosing. Efficacy was evaluated in randomized patients using symptomatic remission.<sup>a</sup> Safety was evaluated for all 588 patients who were treated in the LTE, including the randomized and nonrandomized populations. Through week 156, 131 patients continued on placebo and 457 patients received STELARA. The nonrandomized population included STELARA induction non-responders at week eight who received SC STELARA and responded eight weeks later, and responders to placebo induction.

<b><u>About Ulcerative Colitis</u></b>
More than five million people worldwide are living with Crohn’s disease (CD) and UC—commonly known as inflammatory bowel disease. UC affects nearly 907,000 people in the U.S., with approximately 38,000 new cases diagnosed each year.<sup>5</sup> UC is a chronic disease of the large intestine, also known as the colon, in which the lining of the colon becomes inflamed and develops tiny open sores, or ulcers, that produce pus and mucus. It is the result of an abnormal response by the body's immune system.<sup>6</sup> Symptoms vary but may include loose and more urgent bowel movements, persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloody stool, loss of appetite, weight loss and fatigue.<sup>7</sup>

<b><u>About STELARA<sup>® </sup>(ustekinumab)</u><sup>2</sup></b>
STELARA<sup>® </sup>(ustekinumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody and is the first biologic treatment to selectively inhibit the interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 pathways. STELARA is approved in the United States for the treatment of: 1) adults and children six years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy; 2) adult patients (18 years or older) with active psoriatic arthritis, used alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX); 3) adult patients (18 years and older) with moderately to severely active CD; 4) adult patients (18 years and older) with moderately to severely active UC.

The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson maintain exclusive worldwide marketing rights to STELARA<sup>®</sup>.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>
STELARA<sup>®</sup> is a prescription medicine that affects your immune system. STELARA<sup>®</sup> can increase your chance of having serious side effects including:

<b>Serious Infections</b>
STELARA<sup>®</sup> may lower your ability to fight infections and may increase your risk of infections. While taking STELARA<sup>®</sup>, some people have serious infections, which may require hospitalization, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses.
<ul>
 	<li>Your doctor should check you for TB before starting STELARA<sup>®</sup> and watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with STELARA<sup>®</sup>.</li>
 	<li>If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated for TB before and during treatment with STELARA<sup>®</sup>.</li>
</ul>
You should not start taking STELARA<sup>®</sup> if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay.

<b>Before starting STELARA<sup>®</sup>, tell your doctor if you:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as:
<ul>
 	<li>fever, sweats, or chills</li>
 	<li>muscle aches</li>
 	<li>cough</li>
 	<li>shortness of breath</li>
 	<li>blood in phlegm</li>
 	<li>weight loss</li>
 	<li>warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body</li>
 	<li>diarrhea or stomach pain</li>
 	<li>burning when you urinate or urinate more often than normal</li>
 	<li>feel very tired</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>are being treated for an infection.</li>
 	<li>get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back.</li>
 	<li>have TB or have been in close contact with someone with TB.</li>
</ul>
<b>After starting STELARA<sup>®</sup>, call your doctor right away </b>if you have any symptoms of an infection (see above). STELARA<sup>®</sup> can make you more likely to get infections or make an infection that you have worse. People who have a genetic problem where the body does not make any of the proteins interleukin 12 (IL-12) and interleukin 23 (IL-23) are at a higher risk for certain serious infections that can spread throughout the body and cause death. People who take STELARA<sup>®</sup> may also be more likely to get these infections.

<b>Cancers</b>
STELARA<sup>®</sup> may decrease the activity of your immune system and increase your risk for certain types of cancer. Tell your doctor if you have ever had any type of cancer. Some people who had risk factors for skin cancer developed certain types of skin cancers while receiving STELARA<sup>®</sup>. Tell your doctor if you have any new skin growths.

<b>Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)</b>
RPLS is a rare condition that affects the brain and can cause death. The cause of RPLS is not known. If RPLS is found early and treated, most people recover. Tell your doctor right away if you have any new or worsening medical problems including: headache, seizures, confusion, and vision problems.

<b>Serious Allergic Reactions</b>
Serious allergic reactions can occur. Stop using STELARA<sup>®</sup> and get medical help right away if you have any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction such as: feeling faint, swelling of your face, eyelids, tongue, or throat, chest tightness, or skin rash.

<b>Lung Inflammation</b>
Cases of lung inflammation have happened in some people who receive STELARA<sup>®</sup> and may be serious. These lung problems may need to be treated in a hospital. Tell your doctor right away if you develop shortness of breath or a cough that doesn’t go away during treatment with STELARA<sup>®</sup><b>.</b>

<b>Before receiving STELARA<sup>®</sup>, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>have any of the conditions or symptoms listed above for serious infections, cancers, or RPLS.</li>
 	<li>ever had an allergic reaction to STELARA<sup>®</sup> or any of its ingredients. Ask your doctor if you are not sure.</li>
 	<li>are allergic to latex. The needle cover on the prefilled syringe contains latex.</li>
 	<li>have recently received or are scheduled to receive an immunization (vaccine). People who take STELARA<sup>®</sup> should not receive live vaccines. Tell your doctor if anyone in your house needs a live vaccine. The viruses used in some types of live vaccines can spread to people with a weakened immune system, and can cause serious problems. <b>You should not receive the BCG vaccine during the one year before receiving STELARA<sup>®</sup> or one year after you stop receiving STELARA<sup>®</sup>.</b></li>
 	<li>have any new or changing lesions within psoriasis areas or on normal skin.</li>
 	<li>are receiving or have received allergy shots, especially for serious allergic reactions.</li>
 	<li>receive or have received phototherapy for your psoriasis.</li>
 	<li>are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if STELARA<sup>®</sup> can harm your unborn baby. You and your doctor should decide if you will receive STELARA<sup>®</sup>.</li>
 	<li>are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is thought that STELARA<sup>®</sup> passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you receive STELARA<sup>®</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<b>Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take</b>, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

<b>When prescribed STELARA<sup>®</sup>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Use STELARA<sup>®</sup> exactly as your doctor tells you to.</li>
 	<li>STELARA<sup>®</sup> is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of your doctor. In children 6 years and older, it is recommended that STELARA<sup>®</sup> be administered by a healthcare provider. If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver may give your injections of STELARA<sup>®</sup> at home, you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject STELARA<sup>®</sup>. Your doctor will determine the right dose of STELARA<sup>®</sup> for you, the amount for each injection, and how often you should receive it. Do not try to inject STELARA<sup>®</sup> yourself until you or your caregiver have been shown how to inject STELARA<sup>®</sup> by your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>
<b>Common side effects of STELARA<sup>®</sup> include: </b>nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose, upper respiratory infections, fever, headache, tiredness, itching, nausea and vomiting, redness at the injection site, vaginal yeast infections, urinary tract infections, sinus infection, stomach pain, diarrhea, and joint pain. These are not all of the possible side effects with STELARA<sup>®</sup>. Tell your doctor about any side effect that you experience. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

<p align=""justify"">JERSEY CITY, N.J., June 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCYX), a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat and drug-resistant fungal infections, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BREXAFEMME<sup>®</sup> (ibrexafungerp tablets), for oral use in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), also known as vaginal yeast infection. BREXAFEMME, which represents the first approved drug in a novel antifungal class in more than 20 years, was approved based on positive results from two Phase 3 studies in which oral ibrexafungerp demonstrated efficacy and a favorable tolerability profile in women with VVC. SCYNEXIS has partnered with Amplity Health, a leading global contract commercialization organization, to support U.S. commercialization of BREXAFEMME, with commercial launch scheduled in the second half of this year.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The FDA approval of BREXAFEMME is the culmination of years of work and a significant milestone for SCYNEXIS, marking our evolution to a commercial-stage antifungal company. We are pleased with the approved label, highlighting the unique attributes of BREXAFEMME, and thrilled to be able to offer a new treatment option to women with vaginal yeast infections,” said Marco Taglietti, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of SCYNEXIS. “We believe ibrexafungerp has significant commercial potential. This first approval in the U.S. is a major step towards building the ibrexafungerp antifungal franchise as we intend to leverage an extended 10-year period of regulatory exclusivity and 14 years of patent protection. We are in a strong financial position to execute on our commercial plans and are committed to advancing our hospital programs to maximize the broad potential of this novel therapeutic class to help patients with serious and often resistant fungal infections.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">David Angulo, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of SCYNEXIS, added, “We are pleased to bring this much needed innovation to the antifungal field and to offer a new one-day oral antifungal treatment for vaginal yeast infections to millions of women who could benefit from a new therapeutic option. BREXAFEMME has a differentiated fungicidal mechanism of action that kills a broad range of <em>Candida </em>species, including azole-resistant strains. We are working on completing our CANDLE study investigating ibrexafungerp for the prevention of recurrent VVC and expect we will be submitting a supplemental NDA in the first half of 2022. We thank all the clinical investigators and patients who participated in our VANISH clinical trials who made this significant advancement possible.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Ibrexafungerp benefits from both Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations granted by the FDA for the treatment of VVC and prevention of recurrent VVC. Under QIDP designation, BREXAFEMME is expected to receive ten years of market exclusivity in the U.S.: five years of new chemical entity exclusivity plus five additional years of exclusivity extension due to the QIDP designation. BREXAFEMME is also protected by multiple patents, including a composition-of-matter patent covering the ibrexafungerp molecule. With patent term extension, this patent is expected to expire in 2035, providing 14 years of protection in the U.S.</p>

<p align=""justify""><strong>About Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
</strong>VVC, commonly known as a vaginal yeast infection due to <em>Candida</em>, is the second most common cause of vaginitis. Although these infections are frequently caused by <em>Candida albicans</em>, infections caused by fluconazole-resistant and non-<em>albicans</em> <em>Candida</em> strains, such as <em>Candida glabrata</em>, have been reported to be on the rise. VVC can be associated with substantial morbidity, including significant genital discomfort (pain, itching, burning), reduced sexual pleasure and activity, psychological distress (stress, depression, anxiety), embarrassment, reduced physical activity, and loss of productivity. Typical VVC symptoms include pruritus, vaginal soreness, irritation, excoriation of vaginal mucosa and abnormal vaginal discharge. An estimated 70-75% of women worldwide will have at least one episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 40-50% of them will experience multiple episodes.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Currently approved treatments for VVC include BREXAFEMME (ibrexafungerp tablets), several topical antifungals, and oral fluconazole, which is the only other orally administered antifungal approved for the treatment of VVC in the U.S. and which has typically accounted for over 90% of the prescriptions written for this condition every year.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About BREXAFEMME</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (ibrexafungerp tablets), for oral use
</strong>BREXAFEMME is the trade name for ibrexafungerp, a novel oral antifungal approved for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), also known as vaginal yeast infection. Its mechanism of action, glucan synthase inhibition, is fungicidal against <em>Candida </em>species, meaning it kills fungal cells. The New Drug Application (NDA) for BREXAFEMME was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 1, 2021. The NDA was supported by positive results from two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies (VANISH-303 and VANISH-306), in which oral ibrexafungerp demonstrated efficacy and a favorable tolerability profile in women with VVC. BREXAFEMME represents the first approved drug in a new antifungal class in over 20 years and is the first and only treatment for vaginal yeast infections which is both oral and non-azole.

DURHAM, N.C., June 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chimerix (NASDAQ:CMRX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on accelerating the development of medicines to treat cancer and other serious diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted TEMBEXA<sup><strong>®</strong></sup> (brincidofovir) tablets and oral suspension approval for the treatment of smallpox. TEMBEXA is approved for adult and pediatric patients, including neonates.

“We are delighted to report our first FDA approved products for the treatment of smallpox, particularly as the importance of pandemic preparedness has been put into focus over the last year. With this approval in hand, we now look forward to advancing our discussions with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) toward a procurement contract to support national preparedness,” said Mike Sherman, Chief Executive Officer of Chimerix.

Chimerix developed the TEMBEXA oral formulations as medical countermeasures for the treatment of smallpox under an ongoing collaboration with BARDA, part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under contract number HHSO100201100013C.

TEMBEXA’s approval is based on efficacy data in two lethal orthopoxvirus animal models of human smallpox disease, the rabbitpox model (New Zealand White rabbits infected with rabbitpox virus) and the mousepox model (BALB/c mice infected with ectromelia virus). In the pivotal studies in each model, TEMBEXA treatment resulted in statistically significant survival benefit versus placebo following delayed treatment after animals were infected with a lethal viral dose. The FDA’s ‘Animal Rule’ allows for testing of investigational drugs in animal models to support effectiveness in diseases which are not ethical or feasible to study in humans. The TEMBEXA U.S. Prescribing Information has a BOXED WARNING for increased risk for mortality when used for longer duration; see below for Important Safety Information.

<strong>About Chimerix</strong>

Chimerix is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to accelerating the advancement of innovative medicines that make a meaningful impact in the lives of patients living with cancer and other serious diseases. Most recently, the Company obtained FDA approval for brincidofovir as a medical countermeasure for the treatment of smallpox. The Company has two other advanced clinical-stage development programs, ONC201 and dociparstat sodium (DSTAT). ONC201 is currently in a registrational clinical program for recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma and a blinded independent central review is expected later in 2021. DSTAT is in development as a potential first-line therapy in acute myeloid leukemia.

<strong>About Smallpox</strong>

Smallpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the variola virus. Historically, smallpox was one of the deadliest diseases in history with a case fatality rate of approximately 30%. Despite successful eradication of smallpox in the 1970s, there is considerable concern that variola virus could reappear, either through accidental release or as a weapon of bioterrorism. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), variola virus is ranked in the highest risk category for bioterrorism agents (Category A) due to its ease of transmission, high mortality rate, and potential to cause public panic and social disruption.

<strong>About TEMBEXA</strong>

TEMBEXA is an oral antiviral formulated as 100 mg tablets and 10 mg/mL oral suspension dosed once weekly for two weeks. TEMBEXA is indicated for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates. TEMBEXA is not indicated for the treatment of diseases other than human smallpox disease. The effectiveness of TEMBEXA for the treatment of smallpox disease has not been determined in humans because adequate and well-controlled field trials have not been feasible and inducing smallpox disease in humans to study the drug’s efficacy is not ethical. TEMBEXA efficacy may be reduced in immunocompromised patients based on studies in immune deficient animals.

TEMBEXA (brincidofovir) is a nucleotide analog lipid-conjugate designed to mimic a natural monoacyl phospholipid to achieve effective intracellular concentrations of the active antiviral metabolite, cidofovir diphosphate. Cidofovir diphosphate exerts its orthopoxvirus antiviral effects by acting as an alternate substrate inhibitor for viral DNA synthesis mediated by viral DNA polymerase.

<p align=""justify"">DUBLIN, Ireland and BAGSVÆRD, Denmark, July 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prothena Corporation plc (NASDAQ:PRTA) and Novo Nordisk A/S (Nasdaq Copenhagen: NOVO B) today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive purchase agreement under which Novo Nordisk has acquired Prothena’s clinical stage antibody PRX004 and broader ATTR amyloidosis programme.</p>
<p align=""justify"">PRX004 is a phase 2 ready anti-amyloid immunotherapy designed to deplete the amyloid deposits that are associated with the disease pathology of ATTR amyloidosis.</p>
<p align=""justify"">ATTR amyloidosis is a rare, progressive, and fatal disease characterised by the abnormal buildup of amyloid deposits composed of misfolded transthyretin protein in organs and tissues, most commonly the heart and/or nervous system.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Prothena has completed a phase 1 study with PRX004 in patients with hereditary forms of ATTR, in which PRX004 was found to be safe and well tolerated.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Novo Nordisk will initially focus on the clinical development of PRX004 in ATTR cardiomyopathy - an underdiagnosed and potentially fatal form of ATTR amyloidosis characterised by build-up of amyloid deposits in cardiac tissue.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the terms of the definitive purchase agreement, Novo Nordisk acquires Prothena’s wholly-owned subsidiary and gains full worldwide rights to the intellectual property and related rights of Prothena’s ATTR amyloidosis business and pipeline. Prothena is eligible to receive development and sales milestone payments totalling up to 1.2 billion US dollars including 100 million dollars in upfront and near-term clinical milestone payments.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Today’s announcement is consistent with our commitment to create a better future for patients in critical need of new treatment options. We are confident that Novo Nordisk will leverage its extensive expertise in developing treatments for those affected by cardiovascular diseases to advance this promising potential treatment to patients on an expedited timeline,” said Hideki Garren, MD, PhD, chief medical officer of Prothena. “With Novo Nordisk’s commitment to further develop PRX004 in ATTR cardiomyopathy, Prothena will continue to focus on our mission to advance our robust portfolio designed to address rare peripheral amyloid and neurodegenerative diseases. We also wish to extend our sincere thanks and appreciation to all the patients and investigators who participated in the PRX004 phase 1 study.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“With its innovative amyloid-depleting mechanism, PRX004 has the potential to offer a novel treatment option for ATTR cardiomyopathy – an often fatal disease with significant unmet medical need,” said Marcus Schindler, chief scientific officer, EVP Research and Early Development at Novo Nordisk. “This acquisition is a testament to Prothena’s pioneering work in ATTR amyloidosis and Novo Nordisk’s dedication to advancing new disease-modifying therapies for the benefit of people with cardiovascular diseases which are the world’s leading cause of death.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About PRX004</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">PRX004 is an investigational humanised monoclonal antibody designed to deplete amyloid associated with disease pathology that underlies hereditary and wild type ATTR amyloidosis (hATTR and wtATTR, respectively), without affecting the native, normal tetrameric form of the protein. It is generally accepted that at the time of diagnosis, affected organs in ATTR patients contain extracellular amyloid deposits that cause organ dysfunction. PRX004 has been shown in preclinical studies to promote clearance of insoluble amyloid fibrils through antibody-mediated phagocytosis and inhibit amyloid formation. This depleter mechanism of action has the potential to provide benefit for ATTR patients at high risk for early mortality due to amyloid deposition in vital organs.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Prothena has completed a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study (NCT03336580). 21 patients with hereditary ATTR Amyloidosis (hATTR) were enrolled to receive PRX004 intravenously once every 28 days for up to 3 infusions in the dose escalation phase of the study. Patients were enrolled into 1 of the following 6 PRX004 dose cohorts: 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg. Eligible patients who completed dose-escalation were provided the opportunity to enrol in the long-term extension (LTE) portion of the study. All 21 patients enrolled in the Phase 1 study successfully completed dose-escalation and 17 patients were subsequently enrolled in the LTE. PRX004 was found to be safe and well tolerated across all dose levels.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Prothena</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Prothena Corporation plc is a late-stage clinical company with a robust pipeline of novel investigational therapeutics built on protein dysregulation expertise with the potential to change the course of devastating rare peripheral amyloid and neurodegenerative diseases. Fueled by its deep scientific expertise built over decades of research, Prothena is advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates for a number of indications and novel targets for which its ability to integrate scientific insights around neurological dysfunction and the biology of misfolded proteins can be leveraged.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and BEIJING, July 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) and InnoCare Pharma Limited (HKEX: 09969) today announced that they have entered into a license and collaboration agreement for orelabrutinib, an oral small molecule Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) for the potential treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Orelabrutinib is a covalent BTKi with high selectivity and the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and is currently being studied in a multi-country, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in relapsing-remitting MS.

Orelabrutinib inhibits BTK, which is a key enzyme that is part of the signaling cascade of immune cells including B cells and myeloid cells. With the ability to cross the blood brain barrier, orelabrutinib has the potential to inhibit B cell and myeloid cell effector functions in the central nervous system (CNS), and may provide a clinically meaningful benefit on progression in all forms of MS. By addressing the progressive biology of the disease, orelabrutinib may offer people living with MS an additional treatment option and the possibility to slow disease progression.

“Given the complex and chronic nature of MS, we believe the unique characteristics of orelabrutinib, combining high selectivity and CNS penetrance, may translate to potential clinical advantages relative to other BTKi programs,” said Alfred Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., Head of Research and Development at Biogen. “For over 30 years, Biogen has led in MS research and today has a leading portfolio of MS products. We are focused on developing next-generation approaches that we hope will improve outcomes for those living with progressive and relapsing forms of MS.”

“Biogen is a recognized leader in neuroscience and we believe this transaction will help advance the development of orelabrutinib in MS,” said Jasmine Cui, Ph.D., Co-Founder, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer at InnoCare. “We are excited about the potential of orelabrutinib for the treatment of patients with all forms of MS given the potential efficacy and safety profile, plus a promising level of blood-brain barrier penetration. BTK inhibitors may have the potential to transform the treatment paradigm of autoimmune diseases, in particular MS.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Biogen will have exclusive rights to orelabrutinib in the field of MS worldwide and certain autoimmune diseases outside of China (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), while InnoCare will retain exclusive worldwide rights to orelabrutinib in the field of oncology and certain autoimmune diseases in China (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). InnoCare will receive a $125 million upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $812.5 million in potential development milestones and potential commercial payments should the collaboration achieve certain development, commercial milestones and sales thresholds. InnoCare is also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the low to high teens on potential future net sales of any product resulting from the collaboration. Closing of the collaboration is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S., and other customary closing conditions.

<strong>About Orelabrutinib</strong>
Orelabrutinib is a small molecule Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) developed for the treatment of cancer and in development for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases.

In the field of multiple sclerosis, orelabrutinib is a BTKi with high selectivity and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and could achieve high-target occupancy in the central nervous system. It is currently being investigated in a global Phase 2 study in RRMS patients.

In the field of oncology, InnoCare received approval for orelabrutinib from the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in two indications: the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (R/R SLL), and the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (R/R MCL).

<strong>About Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors</strong>
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a tyrosine kinase that is encoded by the BTK gene in humans. BTK plays a crucial role in B-cell receptor signaling cascade in B cells leading to B cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and cytokine production. BTK also plays a key function in myeloid cell signaling. Central nervous system (CNS) penetrant BTK small molecule inhibitors work by inhibiting B cells and myeloid cells in the periphery and in the CNS. Among myeloid cells expressing BTK, microglia, which reside in the CNS, have been shown to express high level of BTK in multiple sclerosis.

""Clinical studies including APOLLO have continued to show the ability of daratumumab-based combination treatment regimens to significantly reduce the risk of progression in patients with multiple myeloma,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Meletios A. Dimopoulos</span>, M.D.*, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, <span class=""xn-location"">Athens, Greece</span>, and principal investigator. ""With this approval, we are now able to combine pomalidomide and dexamethasone with a daratumumab subcutaneous option that can be administered in minutes rather than the hours needed for intravenous administration.""

The APOLLO study met its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival (PFS), demonstrating that DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>-Pd significantly reduced the risk of progression or death by 37 percent, compared to Pd alone (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.47-0.85; <i>P</i>=0.0018).<sup>1</sup> The median PFS for the DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>-Pd arm vs. Pd arm was 12.4 vs. 6.9 months, respectively.<sup>1</sup>  Study findings additionally showed the rate of overall response to be significantly higher in DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>-Pd compared to Pd alone (69 percent vs. 46 percent), as well as rates of complete response or better (25 percent vs. 4 percent) and very good partial response or better (51 percent vs. 20 percent).<sup>1 </sup>Additionally, more patients treated with DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>-Pd showed a negative status for minimal residual disease than patients receiving Pd alone (9 percent vs. 2 percent).<sup>1 </sup>

Permanent treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2 percent of patients who received DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>-Pd. No adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation occurred in more than 1 patient. The most common adverse reactions (=20 percent) were fatigue, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, and diarrhea. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 50 percent of patients who received DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>-Pd. The most frequent serious adverse reactions in &gt;5 percent of patients who received DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>-Pd were pneumonia (15 percent) and lower respiratory tract infection (12 percent). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 7 percent of patients who received DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>-Pd.

""We are focused on the continued development of DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i> and advancing this innovative therapy for patients who are in need of additional treatment options,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Craig Tendler</span>, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""Today's approval further distinguishes DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i> in the treatment of multiple myeloma as the first and only subcutaneously administered anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody approved in combination with the widely used pomalidomide and dexamethasone regimen.""

<b>About Multiple Myeloma<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.<sup>2,3</sup> When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow. In 2021, it is estimated that more than 34,000 people will be diagnosed and close to 12,500 will die from the disease in the U.S.<sup>2,4</sup> While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms, which can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood cell counts, tiredness, high calcium levels, kidney problems or infections.<sup>4</sup>

<b>DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>CONTRAINDICATIONS<br class=""dnr"" /></b>

DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to daratumumab, hyaluronidase or any of the components of the formulation.

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>Hypersensitivity and Other Administration Reactions<sup>2<br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>

Both systemic administration-related reactions, including severe or life-threatening reactions, and local injection-site reactions can occur with DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>.  Fatal reactions have been reported with daratumumab-containing products, including DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>.

<i>Systemic Reactions</i>

In a pooled safety population of 832 patients with multiple myeloma (N=639) or light chain (AL) amyloidosis (N=193) who received DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> as monotherapy or in combination, 9% of patients experienced a systemic administration-related reaction (Grade 2: 3.5%, Grade 3: 0.8%). Systemic administration-related reactions occurred in 8% of patients with the first injection, 0.4% with the second injection, and cumulatively 1% with subsequent injections. The median time to onset was 3.2 hours (range: 9 minutes to 3.5 days). Of the 129 systemic administration-related reactions that occurred in 74 patients, 110 (85%) occurred on the day of DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> administration. Delayed systemic administration-related reactions have occurred in 1% of the patients.

Severe reactions included hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension and tachycardia. Other signs and symptoms of systemic administration-related reactions may include respiratory symptoms, such as bronchospasm, nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing, as well as anaphylactic reaction, pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, nausea, and hypotension.

Pre-medicate patients with histamine-1 receptor antagonist, acetaminophen and corticosteroids. Monitor patients for systemic administration-related reactions, especially following the first and second injections. For anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) administration-related reactions, immediately and permanently discontinue DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup><i>.</i> Consider administering corticosteroids and other medications after the administration of DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> depending on dosing regimen and medical history to minimize the risk of delayed (defined as occurring the day after administration) systemic administration-related reactions.

<i>Local Reactions</i>

In this pooled safety population, injection-site reactions occurred in 8% of patients, including Grade 2 reactions in 0.6%. The most frequent (&gt;1%) injection-site reaction was injection site erythema. These local reactions occurred a median of 5.5 minutes (range: 0 minutes to 6.5 days) after starting administration of DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>. Monitor for local reactions and consider symptomatic management.

<b>Cardiac Toxicity in Patients with Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis<sup>2<br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>Serious or fatal cardiac adverse reactions occurred in patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis who received DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone. Serious cardiac disorders occurred in 16% and fatal cardiac disorders occurred in 10% of patients. Patients with NYHA Class IIIA or Mayo Stage IIIA disease may be at greater risk. Patients with NYHA Class IIIB or IV disease were not studied.  Monitor patients with cardiac involvement of light chain (AL) amyloidosis more frequently for cardiac adverse reactions and administer supportive care as appropriate.

<b>Neutropenia<sup>2<br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>Daratumumab may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy<i>.  </i>Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> until recovery of neutrophils. In lower body weight patients receiving DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>, higher rates of Grade 3-4 neutropenia were observed.

<b>Thrombocytopenia<sup>2<br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>Daratumumab may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy.  Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. Consider withholding DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> until recovery of platelets.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity<sup>2<br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>Based on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> and for 3 months after the last dose.

The combination of DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> with lenalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy.

<b>Interference with Serological Testing<sup>2<br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab administration. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient's serum. The determination of a patient's ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted.

Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup><i>.</i> Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>.

<b>Interference with Determination of Complete Response<sup>2<br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein.  This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup>-treated patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS<sup>2<br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>The most common adverse reaction (=20%) with DARZALEX<i> FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> monotherapy is: upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse reactions with combination therapy (=20% for any combination) include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, insomnia, pyrexia, cough, muscle spasms, back pain, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, peripheral sensory neuropathy, constipation, pneumonia, and peripheral edema.

The most common adverse reactions (=20%) in patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis who received DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, peripheral edema, constipation, fatigue, peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, insomnia, dyspnea, and cough.

The most common hematology laboratory abnormalities (=40%) with DARZALEX <i>FASPRO</i><sup>®</sup> are decreased leukocytes, decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased platelets, and decreased hemoglobin.

<strong>CAMBRIDGE, Mass, USA, and TOKYO, Japan, July 13, 2021</strong> -- Affinivax, Inc. (""Affinivax"") and Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas”) announced results from the Phase 2 clinical trial of ASP3772, a novel vaccine candidate targeting <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. Developed using Affinivax’s proprietary MAPS<sup>™</sup> (Multiple Antigen-Presenting System) platform technology, ASP3772 is designed to offer both B-cell (antibody) and T-cell immune protection against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. ASP3772 includes 24 pneumococcal polysaccharides, as well as two conserved pneumococcal proteins. The results from the Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated that ASP3772 was well tolerated.  ASP3772 also exhibited an antibody response to each of the 24 polysaccharides, as well as an additional antibody response to the conserved pneumococcal proteins. The Phase 2 data for ASP3772 were delivered in an oral presentation at the 31<sup>st</sup> European Congress of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases (ECCMID), taking place online from 9 – 12 July 2021.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for ASP3772 for the prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> serotypes included in ASP3772 in adults aged 50 years and older. The FDA decision is informed by the results of the Phase 2 data. The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy process is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition. Designation is based upon preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.

The Phase 2 clinical trial<sup>1</sup> of ASP3772 was conducted in 503 adults 65 to 85 years of age, and 293 adults received ASP3772, 97 adults received Prevnar13<sup>®</sup> and 113 adults (who were previously vaccinated with Prevnar13<sup>®</sup>) received Pneumovax<sup>®</sup>23. The primary objective was to evaluate safety/tolerability and reactogenicity of ASP3772 compared to Prevnar13<sup>®</sup>. The secondary objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity of ASP3772, versus Prevnar13 or Pneumovax<sup>®</sup>23. A summary of the results is below:
<ul>
 	<li>ASP3772 was observed to be well tolerated with mild and self-limited injection site and systemic reactions, similar to those seen in the Prevnar13<sup>®</sup> group. Frequently reported local reactions were tenderness and pain, occurring within the first 2-3 days with no clear difference across ASP3772 and Prevnar13<sup>®</sup> cohorts.  Neither serious vaccine-related adverse events, nor clinically relevant abnormalities (vital signs, ECGs, laboratory parameters), were observed. No serious adverse events or medically attended adverse events related to immunization and no potentially immune mediated adverse events were observed in subjects through the 180-day safety assessment period post-immunization.</li>
 	<li>At the three dose levels studied, ASP3772 induced a robust immune response to all 24 pneumococcal serotypes in the MAPS<sup>™</sup> vaccine, as measured by both immunoglobulin G (IgG) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA).</li>
 	<li>When compared to Prevnar13<sup>®</sup> alone, ASP3772 demonstrated a similar or better IgG and OPA immune response to the 13 shared serotypes included in both ASP3772 and Prevnar13®. Of note, ASP3772 demonstrated a statistically higher immune response to serotype 3 at all ASP3772 dose levels, as well as a statistically higher immune response to serotypes 5 and 19F at the highest ASP3772 dose tested. ASP3772 also demonstrated a statistically higher immune responses for all remaining 11 serotypes that are not included in Prevnar13<sup>®</sup>.</li>
 	<li>When compared to Prevnar13<sup>®</sup> plus Pneumovax<sup>®</sup>23, ASP3772 demonstrated a similar or better IgG and OPA immune response to the 13 shared serotypes with Prevnar13®. Of note, ASP3772 demonstrated a statistically higher immune responses for serotypes 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, and 18C at the highest dose tested. ASP3772 also demonstrated a similar, and in most cases statistically higher, immune response for all remaining 11 serotypes.</li>
 	<li>ASP3772 also demonstrated an increase in antibodies (more than 2-fold, as measured by geometric mean fold rise in IgG) response to the conserved proteins included in the MAPS<sup>™</sup> vaccine design (i.e., each polysaccharide was combined to a fusion of the two conserved pneumococcal proteins). There were no increases observed in the Prevnar13<sup>®</sup> group.</li>
</ul>
“Extending the coverage to 24 <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> strains, we believe that ASP3772 has the potential to offer broader protection than any pneumococcal vaccine currently on the market or in clinical testing today , and we look forward to continuing to advance this important vaccine candidate through clinical trials in both adults and infants,” said Steven B. Brugger, CEO of Affinivax. “Demonstrating strong immunogenicity to both the polysaccharides and proteins in our ASP3772 vaccine also represents a significant step forward in clinically validating our MAPS<sup>™</sup> technology platform and highlights the promising potential for future MAPS™ vaccines in our pipeline.”

“The MAPS<sup>™</sup> technology offers new ways to address unmet needs for infectious diseases, such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, that affect millions of people” said Salim Mujais, M.D., Senior Vice President and Therapeutic Area Head, Medical Specialties, Astellas.  “We believe that ASP3772 can offer significant potential to provide broader protection from pneumococcal infections that impact both infants and adults in our global community.”

The ASP3772 clinical development program includes indications for protection against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> infections in both adults and infants. The pivotal Phase 3 registration clinical trials in adults are under preparation. A Phase 2 clinical trial with ASP3772 in infants is planned to start following the successful completion of the <a class=""ext"" href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04525599?term=ASP3772&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ongoing Phase 1 study in healthy toddlers</a> 12 to 15 months of age.

In February 2017, Affinivax and Astellas entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement to develop and commercialize a ASP3772 using Affinivax’s proprietary MAPS<sup>™</sup>.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Website-Size-32.jpg,Clinical Trials,Astellas|Affinivax,ASP3772,Streptococcus Pneumoniae|Clinical Trials,publish,13-07-2021,2

<p align=""justify""><strong>EDISON, N.J., July 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- </strong>Hepion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:HEPA), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of liver disease arising from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (""NASH""), today announced positive topline results from its Phase 2a ‘AMBITION’ NASH clinical trial. All primary endpoints of the trial were met.</p>
<p align=""justify"">AMBITION was a Phase 2a randomized, multi-center, placebo controlled, single-blind trial designed to investigate once daily oral administration of CRV431 at doses of 75 mg and 225 mg administered as soft gelatin capsules to presumed F2 and F3 NASH subjects for 28 days, followed by a 14-day observation period for safety.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The primary outcome measure of the AMBITION trial was the incidence of safety and tolerability events of CRV431 <em>versus</em> placebo. CRV431 at both study doses was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events (“SAEs”), and the few adverse events (“AEs”) observed were mostly mild and unrelated to study drug.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In the AMBITION trial, CRV431 blood concentrations after oral dosing of either 75 mg or 225 mg once daily were in the anticipated effective range for NASH treatment. The drug reached maximum concentrations within two hours after dosing with an effective half-life of approximately 30 hours, which supports once daily dosing.</p>
<p align=""justify"">It has been reported in recent literature that reductions in serum alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”) may be used as a surrogate measure for histologic improvement in NASH.<sup>1</sup><sup>,2</sup> The AMBITION trial did not include liver biopsies, however early indications of efficacy in the form of ALT reductions were observed with both CRV431 dosing cohorts. The percent ALT change from baseline to Day 28 numerically demonstrated a CRV431 <em>versus</em> placebo dose-response. These declines were statistically significant from placebo (p &lt; 0.05) when CRV431 doses were pooled. Area-under-the ALT-Curve (“AUC”) for ALT changes, which has been useful in evaluating the magnitude of effect for clinical laboratory measurements of transaminases in NASH, was also calculated. As set out in the table below, CRV431 demonstrated decreasing ALT AUCs with increasing dose, indicating a positive dose-response. In addition, the 225 mg cohort ALT AUC was statistically different from the placebo group AUC.</p>

**Statistically significant from placebo, p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA with Bonferroni Post-Hoc</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The observed changes in serum ALT at this early timepoint, along with the safety and tolerability data are very encouraging and suggest a potential positive impact of CRV431 on hepatocyte health relative to placebo,” commented Stephen Harrison, MD, Principal Investigator of the AMBITION study, Medical Director for Pinnacle Clinical Research, San Antonio, Texas, and Visiting Professor of Hepatology, Oxford University. “I am eagerly anticipating additional biomarker data for this cohort and am hopeful to see corroborating evidence of a biochemical effect. Given the chronic nature of this disease, long-term therapy is likely going to be needed and, therefore, a therapy that is well tolerated, oral and once daily would be advantageous.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Statistical significance in a dose response on ALT is very encouraging, suggesting a rapid drug effect. A thorough review of literature by our group suggested that a 10% to 15% decline in ALT in four weeks over placebo would indicate a beneficial drug effect,” stated Patrick Mayo, Ph.D., Hepion’s SVP, Clinical Pharmacology and Analytics. “Our clinical pharmacology group has already developed a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic, or PK-PD, model which predicts CRV431 blood concentration effect on ALT reductions, which is not usually possible at this early stage in drug development. Additionally, preliminary transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses further support a drug effect when CRV431 blood concentrations exceed 800 ng/mL. This Phase 2a study confirmed CRV431 tolerability and successfully elucidated drug dose range for the upcoming Phase 2b trial.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“In order to embark on a phase 2b program in NASH, these results were critical to inform us on many key parameters for use of CRV431 in this patient population,” said Todd Hobbs, MD, Hepion’s Chief Medical Officer. “Despite the challenges of starting clinical research during the COVID pandemic, the team was able to successfully complete this important trial. We look forward to the start of the large Phase 2b ‘ASCEND-NASH’ trial later this year, which will evaluate CRV431 in biopsy-proven NASH subjects with advanced fibrosis.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“CRV431 is a cyclophilin inhibitor that represents a new approach to treating NASH,” commented Robert Foster, PharmD, Ph.D., Hepion’s CEO. “CRV431 is extensively extracted by the liver after oral dosing and, as such, its potential in treating liver disease is heavily dependent on liver function. We know that liver function declines with NASH, so it was important to design a study to delineate the effects of NASH on the safety, tolerability and PK of CRV431. In addition, this study gave us an opportunity to explore the efficacy potential of CRV431 in NASH subjects. The current findings support this potential, and we will continue to analyze additional incoming data from this trial which should allow us to better understand CRV431. We expect this additional data from the AMBITION trial in the near-term and will report it once we complete our analyses.”</p>

<strong>About Hepion Pharmaceuticals</strong>
<p align=""justify"">The Company's lead drug candidate, CRV431, is a potent inhibitor of cyclophilins, which are involved in many disease processes. CRV431 is currently in clinical-phase development for the treatment of NASH, with the potential to play an important role in the overall treatment of liver disease - from triggering events through to end-stage disease. CRV431 has been shown to reduce liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma tumor burden in experimental models of NASH; and has demonstrated antiviral activities towards HBV, HCV, and HDV through several mechanisms, in nonclinical studies.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Hepion has created a proprietary AI platform, called AI-POWR™, which stands for <strong>A</strong>rtificial Intelligence - <strong>P</strong>recision Medicine; <strong>O</strong>mics (including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and lipidomics); <strong>W</strong>orld database access; and <strong>R</strong>esponse and clinical outcomes. Hepion intends to use AI-POWR™ to help identify which NASH patients will best respond to CRV431, potentially shortening development timelines and increasing the delta between placebo and treatment groups. In addition to using AI-POWR™ to drive its ongoing Phase 2a NASH program, Hepion will use the platform to identify additional potential indications for CRV431 to expand the company's footprint in the cyclophilin inhibition therapeutic space.</p>

MARLBOROUGH, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX) has obtained a CE Mark for the use of saliva samples with the Aptima® SARS-CoV-2 assay in Europe. The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 test is a molecular diagnostic assay that detects the genetic material of the pathogen causing COVID-19. The test runs on the fully automated Panther<sup>®</sup> system.

“This new CE Mark demonstrates our commitment to providing European consumers and healthcare providers as many options as possible to manage the ongoing pandemic,” said Jan Verstreken, Hologic’s group president, International. “While vaccination is helping stem the tide of COVID-19, we envision that testing will continue to play an important role, particularly in screening programs needed to reopen society.”

Collection of saliva is easy, noninvasive and painless. The availability of this alternative specimen type should help facilitate screening in schools, workplaces and other settings. Certain European health authorities have determined that the established assay performance with saliva and the ease of obtaining the sample make saliva suitable for programs that use repeated screenings. The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay is also CE-marked for use with nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs as well as additional specimen types.

Hologic has expanded manufacturing capability to produce Aptima tests in large quantities and has shipped more than 100 million Aptima COVID-19 tests globally since the spring of 2020. Approximately 2,600 Panther systems have been installed in clinical diagnostic laboratories around the world.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

CAMBRIDGE, England &amp; BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bicycle Therapeutics plc (NASDAQ: BCYC), a biotechnology company pioneering a new and differentiated class of therapeutics based on its proprietary bicyclic peptide (<i>Bicycle®</i>) technology, today announced that Ionis Pharmaceuticals has exercised its option and entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement for tissue-targeted delivery of oligonucleotide therapeutics using <i>Bicycles </i>with high affinity to the transferrin receptor (TfR1)<i>.</i>

Ionis had an option for an exclusive license under the terms of a December 2020 evaluation and option agreement. The agreement granted Ionis the right to evaluate tissue-targeting TfR1 binding <i>Bicycles</i> as vehicles to deliver oligonucleotide therapeutics to specific organ systems and an option to obtain an exclusive license at the end of the evaluation period.

Bicycle receives a total of $45 million upfront, which includes a license fee, an option fee, and an $11 million equity investment. Bicycle is also eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties for each program developed under the collaboration.

“This agreement stems from a highly successful collaboration with Ionis that began earlier in the year, during which <i>Bicycles</i> were shown to selectively deliver oligonucleotide payloads into TfR1-expressing tissue,” said Kevin Lee, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Bicycle Therapeutics. “These data build upon our own work, and that of our partners, which have shown <i>Bicycles</i> targeted to tumor antigens can rapidly and selectively deliver a variety of payloads into solid tumors. This tissue-targeting payload-delivery capability is facilitated by the unique nature of <i>Bicycles </i>that inherently enables the conjugation of a diverse range of molecular cargos without impacting the pharmacology of the target. We believe <i>Bicycles</i> have the potential to become the targeting technology of choice for the development of precision medicines.”

Bicycle has identified binders that it believes to be the first small molecules to target TfR1 with high specificity without modifying TfR1’s natural function. These binders present broad conjugation potential across multiple payloads, thereby resulting in the potential to treat diseases in multiple therapeutic areas, including those of the skeletal and cardiac muscles and of the central nervous system. Bicycle is currently also collaborating with the Dementia Discovery Fund (DDF) to advance potential TfR1 <i>Bicycles </i>for treating dementia.

Under the terms of the license and collaboration agreement, Ionis and Bicycle will collaborate to develop a pipeline of oligonucleotide therapeutic product candidates delivered using the tissue-targeting TfR1 <i>Bicycle </i>technology, while Bicycle retains the rights to use TfR1 <i>Bicycles</i> for all non-oligonucleotide therapeutic purposes, including within its existing collaboration with DDF targeting dementia.

<b>About Bicycle Therapeutics</b>

Bicycle Therapeutics (NASDAQ: BCYC) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of medicines, referred to as <i>Bicycles</i>, for diseases that are underserved by existing therapeutics. <i>Bicycles</i> are fully synthetic short peptides constrained with small molecule scaffolds to form two loops that stabilize their structural geometry. This constraint facilitates target binding with high affinity and selectivity, making <i>Bicycles</i> attractive candidates for drug development. Bicycle is evaluating BT5528, a second-generation Bicycle Toxin Conjugate (BTC) targeting EphA2, and BT8009, a second-generation BTC targeting Nectin-4, a well-validated tumor antigen, in company-sponsored Phase I/II trials. In addition, BT1718, a BTC that targets MT1-MMP, is being investigated in an ongoing Phase I/IIa clinical trial sponsored by the Centre for Drug Development of Cancer Research UK. Bicycle is headquartered in Cambridge, UK, with many key functions and members of its leadership team located in Lexington, MA.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","DUBLIN, Ireland and TREVOSE, Pa., July 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Strongbridge Biopharma plc, (Nasdaq: SBBP), a global commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for rare diseases with significant unmet needs, today announced that post hoc analyses from a one year open-label study evaluating daily use of KEVEYIS® (dichlorphenamide) for the treatment of Primary Periodic Paralysis (PPP) following a nine-week randomized, controlled study were published in the peer-reviewed journal, Muscle & Nerve. The results confirmed that long-term treatment with KEVEYIS is safe and effective for chronic use.

“The published results from the post hoc analyses of the HYPHOP study extend the positive findings from the original KEVEYIS® (dichlorphenamide) HYPHOP study by demonstrating that efficacy was maintained over the entire 61-week study with no evidence of waning over time,” said Fredric Cohen, M.D., chief medical officer of Strongbridge Biopharma. “Moreover, there was evidence of further reduction in median weekly attacks among continuous KEVEYIS users to nearly none by the end of the study, and patients who were switched from placebo to open-label KEVEYIS after week nine had reduced attack rates that were similar in frequency at the end of the study to those who had been continuously treated with KEVEYIS over the entire study. Collectively, these results reinforce the utility of KEVEYIS as an effective option in treating PPP, a life-long rare, hereditary skeletal muscle disorder that leads to debilitating attacks of muscle weakness.”

The open label extension results of HYPHOP add to previously reported results from the short-term randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study, with hyperkalemic and hypokalemic PPP sub-studies, which demonstrated the effectiveness of KEVEYIS to prevent attacks of muscle weakness.

Adverse event analyses indicated no new safety signals during the final 52 weeks of the study versus the first nine weeks, with the common adverse events of paresthesia and cognition impairment, reported at lower frequencies during the extension as compared with the first 9 weeks. Clinicians can advise patients starting KEVEYIS that most patients who had one of these events initially reported it within the first month of treatment. Temporary dose reduction appeared to be a reasonable approach to manage bothersome paresthesia or cognition-related AEs, as patients with these AEs who were managed with dosage reduction often had subsequent symptom resolution.

BERKELEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Caribou Biosciences, Inc., a leading clinical-stage CRISPR genome-editing biopharmaceutical company, announced today that the first patient has been dosed in its open-label, multicenter ANTLER phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04637763) to evaluate the company’s lead product candidate, CB-010, in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL). CB-010 is an allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy derived from healthy donor T cells that have been engineered using Caribou’s chRDNA technology to reduce the risk of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and knock out PD-1 to boost the persistence of CAR-T cell antitumor activity.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“Advancing our first allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy into the clinic represents a major milestone for Caribou,” said Rachel Haurwitz, Ph.D., Caribou’s president and chief executive officer. “Using our proprietary chRDNA CRISPR technology, we have developed a pipeline of off-the-shelf CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies with the potential to serve a greater number of patients than autologous approaches. We believe that improving cell persistence is the key to unlocking the full potential of these therapies. Using our technologies, we edit the genome of healthy donor-derived T cells to enable highly specific and efficient insertion or deletion of genes at multiple sites. This allows us to create sophisticated allogeneic cell therapies with enhanced characteristics to potentially improve their effectiveness and durability of antitumor activity compared to other allogeneic cell therapies. With CB-010, we are evaluating the potential persistence-enhancing effects of removing the PD-1 protein from the surface of these CD19-targeted CAR-T cells.”

Cherry Thomas, M.D., senior vice president of clinical development, added, “We are thrilled to advance CB-010 in the clinic and believe it potentially represents a promising, differentiated therapy for patients. Initially, we will evaluate escalating doses of CB-010 in relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients with the goals of assessing safety and tolerability and to establish a dose level for the expansion phase of the study. We look forward to having initial clinical data from this clinical trial in 2022.”

<b>About CB-010</b>

CB-010 is an allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy derived from healthy donor T cells. The cells are engineered using Caribou’s chRDNA CRISPR technology to integrate a CD19-CAR site-specifically into the T cell genome at the site of the <i>TRAC</i> gene locus, thus eliminating expression of the T cell receptor to reduce the risk of GvHD. The cells are modified further using chRDNA to knock out the gene encoding PD-1, thus preventing the expression of the PD-1 protein on the CAR-T cell surface. Elimination of PD-1 expression is designed to boost the persistence of CAR-T cell antitumor activity by reducing CB-010 exhaustion and thereby potentially providing a better therapeutic index compared to other allogeneic CAR-T cells. An additional step in the manufacturing process for CB-010 is designed to remove residual T cells expressing a T cell receptor, further reducing the risk of GvHD.

<b>About the Phase 1, Dose Escalation Study of CB-010 (ANTLER Study, <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04637763%3Fterm%3Dcaribou%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&amp;esheet=52457852&amp;newsitemid=20210712005106&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT04637763&amp;index=3&amp;md5=93629766a3b27b6f96ea8b5035834688"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT04637763</a>)</b>

The ANTLER study is an open-label, multicenter phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate CB-010 in adults with r/r B-NHL. In the dose-escalation part of the study, adults who have failed at least two lines of chemo and/or immunotherapy will receive CB-010 following lymphodepletion. In a standard 3+3 dose escalation design, increasing doses of CB-010 will be evaluated to determine safety and tolerability and to establish a dose level for the expansion part of the study. The primary objective of the dose escalation is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CB-010 and the primary objective of the expansion part of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CB-010 in a defined population. Patients who have received a prior CD19-targeted therapy will be excluded from the study.

<b>About Caribou’s Novel Next-Generation CRISPR Platform</b>

CRISPR genome editing uses easily designed, modular biological tools to make DNA changes in living cells. There are two basic components of Type II CRISPR systems: the nuclease protein that cuts DNA and the RNA molecule(s) that guide the nuclease to generate a site-specific, double-stranded break, leading to an edit at the targeted genomic site. CRISPR systems occasionally edit unintended genomic sites, known as off-target editing, which may lead to harmful effects on cellular function and phenotype. In response to this challenge, Caribou has developed chRDNAs (pronounced “chardonnays”), RNA-DNA hybrid guides that direct substantially more precise genome editing compared to all-RNA guides. Caribou is deploying the power of the chRDNA technology to carry out high efficiency multiple edits, including multiplex gene insertions, to develop CRISPR-edited therapies.

<b>About Caribou Biosciences, Inc.</b>

Caribou is a clinical-stage CRISPR genome-editing biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients with devastating diseases by applying the company’s proprietary chRDNA technology toward the development of next-generation, genome-edited cell therapies. The company is developing a pipeline of genome-edited, off-the-shelf CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies for the treatment of both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors against cell surface targets for which autologous CAR-T cell therapeutics have previously demonstrated clinical proof of concept as well as new targets.

<p align=""justify""><strong>Mechelen, Belgium; </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>4</strong> <strong>July</strong><strong> 2021; </strong><strong>2</strong><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>01</strong><strong> CET</strong><strong>; </strong><strong>regulated information </strong><strong>- </strong><strong>Galapagos </strong><strong>NV </strong><strong>(Euronext &amp; Nasda</strong><strong>q</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> GLPG)</strong> <strong>reports </strong><strong>positive </strong><strong>topline results</strong> <strong>with </strong><strong>tyrosine kinase</strong><strong> 2 (</strong><strong>TYK2</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> inhibitor GLPG3667 in </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>Phase 1b study</strong> <strong>in psoriasis patients</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>GLPG3667 was discovered by Galapagos.</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Galapagos evaluated GLPG3667, a proprietary selective TYK2 compound, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 1b study in 31 patients with diagnosis of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to a daily oral dose of GLPG3667 (low dose or high dose) or placebo, for a total of four weeks. Main objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GLPG3667 as well as signs of clinical activity at Week 4.</p>
<p align=""justify"">GLPG3667 was well tolerated in this Phase 1b trial. One patient in the low dose group interrupted the study for one day for exacerbation of psoriasis. The majority of treatment related adverse events (AEs) were mild in nature and transient. There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) in this 4-week study. At Week 4, four out of 10 patients in the high dose group had a PASI<sup>1</sup> 50 response, defined as at least a 50% improvement in PASI from baseline, compared to one out of 10 subjects on placebo. There were no subjects with a PASI 50 response on the low dose of GLPG3667. The four responders in the high dose group of GLPG3667 achieved a 52%, 65%, 74% and 81% improvement respectively in their PASI scores from baseline, while the subject randomized to placebo improved by 52%. Positive efficacy signals were also observed with the high dose for other endpoints, including affected Body Surface Area and physician and patient global assessment, versus placebo at Week 4.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are pleased with the efficacy signal and safety profile observed with GLPG3667 in patients with psoriasis over a 4-week period,” said Dr. Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer of Galapagos. “Based on these results, we aim to initiate a global Phase 2b program in psoriasis next year as part of a program to develop our selective oral TYK2 inhibitor GLPG3667 broadly in inflammatory indications.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The PASI 50 scores and other efficacy data after only four weeks of treatment, combined with the safety profile observed, are very supportive for moving this compound into a larger trial in psoriasis. People living with psoriasis remain in need of alternative treatments, especially oral ones,” said Prof. Dr. Diamant Thaci, Professor of Medicine at the Comprehensive Center for Inflammation Medicine, University of Lübeck, Germany.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Galapagos intends to submit study outcomes with GLPG3667 for publication at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed medical journals.</p>

<strong>Basel, July 14, 2021</strong> — Novartis today announced that <em>The New England Journal of Medicine </em>(NEJM) published positive results from the Phase III REACH3 trial demonstrating Jakavi<sup>®</sup> (ruxolitinib) significantly improved outcomes in patients with steroid-refractory/dependent chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) compared to best available therapy (BAT)<sup>1</sup>. The study’s main findings, which had been previously presented at the 62<sup>nd</sup> American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, were published along with new subgroup analyses showing favorable overall response rate (ORR) at week 24 for Jakavi across all major subgroups, including baseline individual organ involvement<sup>1</sup>. REACH3 is jointly sponsored by Novartis and Incyte.

“Patients with chronic GvHD can experience severe and life-threatening symptoms in different organs around the body, which makes the disease more difficult to treat and increases the risk of poor outcomes,” said Dr. Robert Zeiser, University Hospital Freiburg, Department of Haematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Freiburg, Germany. “With these new results from REACH3, we can see more clearly the potential benefits of what may become a new standard of care for chronic GvHD patients who have not adequately responded to first-line steroids.”

The study found that treatment with Jakavi led to significant improvements in ORR at week 24 (49.7% vs. 25.6%; odds ratio [OR], 2.99; P&lt;0.001<sup>i</sup>), which was the trial’s primary endpoint<sup>1</sup>. Also, best overall response (BOR) rate at any time up to week 24 was achieved in 76.4% of patients in the Jakavi arm compared to 60.4% in the BAT arm (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.34-3.52)<sup>1</sup>. Jakavi also demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in key secondary endpoints<sup>1</sup>:
<ul>
 	<li>Patients on Jakavi achieved longer failure-free survival (FFS) than patients receiving BAT (median FFS not yet reached vs. 5.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.51; P&lt;0.001).</li>
 	<li>Jakavi-treated patients also had greater improvements in self-reported symptoms compared to BAT<sup>1 </sup>(24.2% vs. 11.0%; OR, 2.62; P=0.001)<sup>ii</sup>.</li>
</ul>
In addition, a new subgroup analysis included in the publication found that patients on Jakavi had better outcomes regardless of the individual organs affected at baseline<sup>1</sup>.

“These new Jakavi data underscore its potential benefits and the importance of making it available to patients at risk for an all-too-common and life-threatening complication of stem cell transplants,” said Susanne Schaffert, PhD, President, Novartis Oncology. “We are pleased that regulatory submissions are underway and will continue to work toward wide accessibility of this important new medicine for GvHD.”

No new safety signals were observed in REACH3, and adverse events (AEs) attributable to treatment were consistent with the mechanism of action and the known safety profile of Jakavi<sup>1</sup>. The most common AEs of grade 3 or higher in the Jakavi vs. BAT arms were thrombocytopenia (15.2% vs. 10.1%), anemia (12.7% vs. 7.6%), neutropenia (8.5% vs. 3.8%) and pneumonia (8.5% vs. 9.5%). While 37.6% and 16.5% of patients required Jakavi and BAT dose modifications due to AEs, respectively, the number of patients who discontinued treatment due to AEs was low (16.4% Jakavi vs. 7% BAT)<sup>1</sup>. Mortality rates were similar across treatment arms (18.8% Jakavi vs. 16.5% BAT)<sup>1</sup>. Deaths reported as primarily due to chronic GvHD were slightly higher for Jakavi<sup>1</sup>.

In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ruxolitinib (marketed by Incyte Corporation in the US as Jakafi<sup>®</sup>) for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GvHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older, based on results of the single-arm Phase II REACH1 trial<sup>6</sup>. The Incyte filing in the US for Jakafi in steroid-refractory chronic GvHD is currently undergoing review by the FDA. Outside the US, Novartis regulatory submissions for acute and chronic GvHD are underway worldwide.

<strong>About Jakavi</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (ruxolitinib)</strong>
Jakavi<sup>®</sup> (ruxolitinib) is an oral inhibitor of the JAK 1 and JAK 2 tyrosine kinases. Jakavi is approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who are refractory to or intolerant of hydroxyurea and for the treatment of disease- related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (MF) (also known as chronic idiopathic MF), post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Jakavi is approved in over 100 countries for patients with MF, including EU countries, Switzerland, Canada, Japan and in more than 85 countries for patients with PV, including EU countries, Switzerland, Japan and Canada. The exact indication for Jakavi varies by country. Additional worldwide regulatory filings are underway in MF and PV.

Novartis licensed ruxolitinib from Incyte Corporation for development and commercialization outside the United States. Ruxolitinib is marketed in the United States by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi<sup>®</sup> for patients with PV who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, for patients with intermediate or high-risk MF, and steroid-refractory acute GvHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older<sup>6</sup>.

The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in PV is 10 mg given orally twice daily. The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in MF is 15 mg given orally twice daily for patients with a platelet count between 100,000 cubic millimeters (mm) and 200,000 mm, and 20 mg twice daily for patients with a platelet count of &gt;200,000 mm. Doses may be titrated based on safety and efficacy. There is limited information to recommend a starting dose for MF and PV patients with platelet counts between 50,000/mm and &lt;100,000/mm. The maximum recommended starting dose in these patients is 5 mg twice daily, and patients should be titrated cautiously<sup>7</sup>.

Jakavi is a registered trademark of Novartis AG in countries outside the United States. Jakafi is a registered trademark of Incyte Corporation. The safety and efficacy profile of Jakavi has not yet been established outside of its approved indications.

<strong>Important Safety Information</strong>
Jakavi can cause serious side effects, including a decrease in blood cell count and infections. Complete blood count monitoring is recommended. Dose reduction or interruption may be required in patients with any hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment or in patients developing hematologic adverse reactions such as thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia. Dose reductions are also recommended when Jakavi is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole. Use of Jakavi during pregnancy is not recommended, and women should avoid becoming pregnant during Jakavi therapy. Women taking Jakavi should not breast feed. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported. Physicians should be alert for neuropsychiatric symptoms suggestive of PML.

Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increases have been reported in patients with chronic HBV infections. Patients with chronic HBV infection should be treated and monitored according to clinical guidelines. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) has been reported in Jakavi treated patients. Periodic skin examination is recommended. Very common adverse reactions in MF (&gt;10%) include urinary tract infections, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, hypercholesterolemia, dizziness, headache, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, bruising and weight gain. Common adverse reactions in MF (1 to 10%) include herpes zoster and flatulence. Uncommon adverse reactions in MF include tuberculosis. Very common adverse reactions in PV (&gt;10%) include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased. Common adverse reactions in PV (1 to 10%) include urinary tract infections, herpes zoster, weight gain, constipation and hypertension.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., July 14, 2021 – Interim results from a Phase 1/2a sub-study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) demonstrated that both humoral (antibody) and cellular (T-cell) immune responses generated by the Johnson & Johnson single-shot COVID-19 vaccine were strong and stable through eight months after immunization, the length of time evaluated to date. Data showed that T-cell responses – including the important CD8+ T-cells that seek out and destroy infected cells – persisted over the eight-month timeframe examined. The Company announced topline preprint study results from this Phase 1/2a sub-study on July 1, 2021.

Data from the study conducted in collaboration with Dan Barouch, M.D., Ph.D., et al. of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center suggest maturation of B-cell response without further boosting. Mature B-cells produce antibodies, which can help fight the virus that causes COVID-19.

Findings indicate that a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine elicited dual mechanisms of protection against COVID-19 disease, including against disease caused by the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) and other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Epsilon (B.1.429) and Kappa (B.1.617.1) variants, as well as the original SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA1/2020). These data suggest an expansion of neutralizing antibodies over eight months, along with the observations of durable T-cell responses and the suggestion of B-cell maturation.

“These peer-reviewed data provide further and deeper insights into the durable humoral and cellular immune responses elicited by the single-shot Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, thus offering potentially a dual mechanism of protection against COVID-19 disease, including against the Delta variant and other variants of concern,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. “The study showed that variant-specific neutralizing antibodies increased over the eight months examined after vaccination which suggests the maturation of B-cell responses. In addition, the T-cell responses are especially strong and stable over time, which is also potentially important for activity against these variants.”

Sum total of recent data affirm ability to generate multiple components of immune responses
These data also extend and complement previously published results in Nature, which provided evidence of the vaccine’s ability to elicit multiple components of the immune system in individuals, as well as preclinical data in Nature related to efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the Beta variant in non-human primates. Collectively, these analyses indicate that the potential efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19, including disease caused by variants, should be considered in a broader immunological context regarding the role of non-neutralizing antibodies, B- and T-cells.

Additional data from a new analysis of blood samples obtained from a subset of participants (n=8) in the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study posted on bioRxiv showed that the Johnson & Johnson single-shot COVID-19 vaccine elicited neutralizing antibody activity against the Delta variant at a higher level than what was recently observed for the Beta variant in South Africa.

Phase 1/2a Study Design (VAC31518COV1001)
This ongoing Phase 1/2a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine at two dose levels (5×1010 or 1×1011 virus particles), administered intramuscularly as single-dose or two-dose schedules, eight weeks apart, in healthy adults. The study is ongoing at multiple clinical sites in Belgium and the United States.

The results from this sub-study are from cohort 1b of this ongoing Phase 1/2a study, which enrolled 25 adults who are 18-55 years of age at a single site at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for detailed descriptive exploratory immunogenicity studies. Additional follow-up with trial participants is currently underway.

Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine
The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine leverages the AdVac® vaccine platform proprietary technology that was also used to develop and manufacture Janssen’s European Commission-approved Ebola vaccine regimen and construct its investigational Zika, RSV and HIV vaccines.

This Phase 1/2a clinical trial has been funded in part with federal funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under other transaction authority (“OTA”) agreement No. HHSO100201700018C.

What is the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine?
The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is an unapproved vaccine that may prevent COVID-19. There is no FDA-approved vaccine to prevent COVID-19.

The FDA has authorized the emergency use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WHAT SHOULD YOU MENTION TO YOUR VACCINATION PROVIDER BEFORE YOU GET THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE?
Tell the vaccination provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have any allergies
have a fever
have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner
are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant
are breastfeeding
have received another COVID-19 vaccine
WHO SHOULD NOT GET THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE?
You should not get the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine if you:

had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine.
HOW IS THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE GIVEN?
The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine will be given to you as an injection into the muscle. The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination schedule is a single dose.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE?
Side effects that have been reported with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine include:

Injection site reactions: pain, redness of the skin, and swelling.
General side effects: headache, feeling very tired, muscle aches, nausea, fever.
Severe Allergic Reactions
There is a remote chance that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received your vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include:

Difficulty breathing
Swelling of your face and throat
A fast heartbeat
A bad rash all over your body
Dizziness and weakness
Blood Clots with Low Levels of Platelets
Blood clots involving blood vessels in the brain, lungs, abdomen, and legs along with low levels of platelets (blood cells that help your body stop bleeding), have occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In people who developed these blood clots and low levels of platelets, symptoms began approximately one to two-weeks following vaccination. Reporting of these blood clots and low levels of platelets has been highest in females ages 18 through 49 years. The chance of having this occur is remote. You should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine:

Shortness of breath,
Chest pain,
Leg swelling,
Persistent abdominal pain,
Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision,
Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of the injection.
These may not be all the possible side effects of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. Serious and unexpected effects may occur. The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is still being studied in clinical trials.

Guillain Barré Syndrome
Guillain Barré syndrome (a neurological disorder in which the body’s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis) has occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In most of these people, symptoms began within 42 days following receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low. You should seek medical attention right away if you develop any of the following symptoms after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine:

Weakness or tingling sensations, especially in the legs or arms, that’s worsening and spreading to other parts of the body
Difficulty walking
Difficulty with facial movements, including speaking, chewing, or swallowing
Double vision or inability to move eyes
Difficulty with bladder control or bowel function
WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS?
If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1, or go to the nearest hospital.

Call the vaccination provider or your healthcare provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away.

<strong>PARIS, FRANCE and GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN, 15 July 2021 – </strong>Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) and IRLAB (Nasdaq Stockholm; IRLAB A) today announced the signing of a licensing agreement, providing Ipsen exclusive worldwide development and commercial rights to mesdopetam, a novel dopamine D3-receptor antagonist. Mesdopetam is being assessed in Phase IIb clinical trials as a potential treatment option for people living with Parkinson’s disease (PD) experiencing levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). It is estimated that approximately 40-50 percent of people living with PD will experience LID after five years of initiating dopamine replacement therapy. LID currently has limited treatment options.<a href=""https://www.ipsen.com/press-releases/ipsen-and-irlab-enter-exclusive-worldwide-licensing-agreement-aimed-to-improve-the-lives-of-people-living-with-parkinsons-disease/#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2"">[ii]</a><sup>,<a href=""https://www.ipsen.com/press-releases/ipsen-and-irlab-enter-exclusive-worldwide-licensing-agreement-aimed-to-improve-the-lives-of-people-living-with-parkinsons-disease/#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3"">[iii]</a>,<a href=""https://www.ipsen.com/press-releases/ipsen-and-irlab-enter-exclusive-worldwide-licensing-agreement-aimed-to-improve-the-lives-of-people-living-with-parkinsons-disease/#_edn4"" name=""_ednref4"">[iv]</a></sup> Mesdopetam is also in early development for Parkinson’s Disease Psychosis (PDP), which is a common symptom of PD; around 50 percent of people with PD eventually develop such symptoms over the course of their disease.<a href=""https://www.ipsen.com/press-releases/ipsen-and-irlab-enter-exclusive-worldwide-licensing-agreement-aimed-to-improve-the-lives-of-people-living-with-parkinsons-disease/#_edn5"" name=""_ednref5"">[v]</a>

PD is a common, progressive neurodegenerative condition affecting more than 10 million people worldwide.<a href=""https://www.ipsen.com/press-releases/ipsen-and-irlab-enter-exclusive-worldwide-licensing-agreement-aimed-to-improve-the-lives-of-people-living-with-parkinsons-disease/#_edn6"" name=""_ednref6"">[vi]</a> PD affects nerve cells in the brain that control movement and affects patients differently; the most common motor symptoms however are tremor, muscle rigidity and slowness of movement. People living with PD also experience other problems not related to movement including anxiety, pain and depression.<a href=""https://www.ipsen.com/press-releases/ipsen-and-irlab-enter-exclusive-worldwide-licensing-agreement-aimed-to-improve-the-lives-of-people-living-with-parkinsons-disease/#_edn7"" name=""_ednref7"">[vii]</a> Symptoms of PD are most commonly managed by medicines, such as levodopa that aim to compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons. A common side effect of levodopa is dyskinesia, involuntary and erratic movements of the face, arms, legs or trunk.<a href=""https://www.ipsen.com/press-releases/ipsen-and-irlab-enter-exclusive-worldwide-licensing-agreement-aimed-to-improve-the-lives-of-people-living-with-parkinsons-disease/#_edn8"" name=""_ednref8"">[viii]</a> For many people, dyskinesias can be so severe that they interfere with normal functioning.<a href=""https://www.ipsen.com/press-releases/ipsen-and-irlab-enter-exclusive-worldwide-licensing-agreement-aimed-to-improve-the-lives-of-people-living-with-parkinsons-disease/#_edn9"" name=""_ednref9"">[ix]</a> Mesdopetam has also shown antipsychotic properties in preclinical studies.

Dr Howard Mayer, Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development, Ipsen, said <em>“We are excited to enter this licensing agreement with IRLAB. By working in partnership, we aim to bring investigational mesdopetam to people living with Parkinson’s disease experiencing levodopa-induced dyskinesia. We are delighted to strengthen our pipeline and deepen our commitment to the neuroscience community around the world, including to patients living with this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.”</em>

Dr Nicholas Waters, CEO of IRLAB, said <em>“We believe in the potential of investigational mesdopetam for people with Parkinson’s disease experiencing dyskinesia or psychosis.</em><em> We have purposefully worked to find a partner to pursue the late-stage clinical development of mesdopetam to commercialization and launch on a global market. Ipsen shares the broad vision for mesdopetam and the commitment to people with neurological disorders. We are very excited to enter the final steps of the journey to market in collaboration with Ipsen. Additionally, we are proud of the accomplishment this important collaboration represents. The agreement and partnership with Ipsen is a validation of our proprietary discovery platform, ISP, and our drug development efforts. This deal is one of the larger deals struck in the Swedish biotech space in decades, which is a merit for all of us at IRLAB and to those who have supported the mesdopetam project to reach this milestone.”</em>

Under the terms of the agreement, IRLAB will be eligible to receive up to $363m, including an upfront cash payment of $28m and up to $335m in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. IRLAB is also eligible to receive tiered low double-digit royalties on worldwide net sales of mesdopetam. The transaction does not impact Ipsen’s financial guidance for 2021.

This information is information that IRLAB is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation. The information was submitted for publication, through the agency of the contact persons set out below, at 15 July 2021, 17:45 CET.

<strong>About mesdopetam</strong>

Mesdopetam (IRL790) is a dopamine D3-receptor antagonist being developed to prevent and treat levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs), a severe form of troublesome involuntary movements commonly occurring in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mesdopetam is also in development for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson’s (PDP). In clinical studies, mesdopetam reduces time spent with troublesome dyskinesia and thereby increases daily ‘good ON-time’ in patients with Parkinson’s. Preclinical studies show that mesdopetam is a potent and efficacious antidyskinetic, and that mesdopetam also has the potential to prevent the development of dyskinesia. In addition, mesdopetam has shown antipsychotic properties in preclinical studies.

The forward-looking statements, objectives and targets contained herein are based on the Group’s management strategy, current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect the Group’s future ability to achieve its financial targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words “believes”, “anticipates” and “expects” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including the Group’s expectations regarding future events, including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover, the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by the Group. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably for regulatory or competition reasons. The Group must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore, the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that the Group may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore, the Group cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during pre-clinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the Group’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the Group’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. The Group also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to the Group’s activities and financial results. The Group cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of the Group’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on the Group’s business, financial position or performance. The Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements, targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, unless so required by applicable law.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 15, 2021-- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced positive topline results from a Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ULTOMIRIS<sup>®</sup> (ravulizumab-cwvz) in adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). The study met, with high statistical significance, its primary endpoint of change from baseline in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living Profile (MG-ADL) total score, a patient-reported assessment, at Week 26, and for the subset of patients who have completed 26 weeks in the extension study to date, the positive treatment effect was maintained through a total of 52 weeks. ULTOMIRIS was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that observed in Phase 3 studies in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Based on these results, Alexion plans to make regulatory filings in the U.S., European Union and Japan in late 2021/early 2022.

“The treatment landscape for people living with gMG has advanced and expanded rapidly in recent years, empowering both patients and caregivers. However, as a clinician and scientist, I know the work is not done,” said Professor James F. Howard, M.D., Department of Neurology at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA, and lead primary investigator in the Phase 3 study. “These Phase 3 ULTOMIRIS results reinforce the critical role complement inhibition plays in treating gMG. I am encouraged by the opportunity this could provide for more patients to be treated early with a mechanism of action designed to preserve neuromuscular function.”

“The approval of SOLIRIS was a critically important first step in addressing the urgent need for a treatment for people with severe symptoms and complications of MG, and was the first new treatment for this devastating disease in more than 60 years. Today’s results demonstrate that ULTOMIRIS may help a broader range of patients than was studied in the SOLIRIS Phase 3 trial, including those with milder symptoms or earlier in their treatment journey, while still offering clinically meaningful benefits that were seen as early as Week 1 and maintained up to 52 weeks,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research &amp; Development at Alexion. “These data provide confidence that ULTOMIRIS has the potential to become the new standard of care for gMG and may reduce patient burden with its less frequent dosing schedule, leading to better treatment adherence and patient satisfaction. We are working to prepare regulatory submissions in the U.S., EU and Japan as quickly as possible.”

<b>About the Phase 3 Study
</b>This global Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 26-week study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ULTOMIRIS in adults with gMG who were not previously treated with a complement inhibitor medicine. The study enrolled 175 patients across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Japan. To enter the study, participants were required to have a confirmed MG diagnosis at least 6 months prior to the screening visit with a positive serologic test for anti-AChR antibodies, MG-ADL total score of at least 6 at study entry and Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Clinical Classification Class II to IV at screening. There was no requirement for prior treatment failure, and patients could stay on stable standard of care medicines, with a few exceptions, for the duration of the study.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ULTOMIRIS or placebo for a total of 26 weeks. Patients received a single weight-based loading dose on Day 1, followed by regular weight-based maintenance dosing beginning on Day 15, every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint of change from baseline in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living Profile (MG-ADL) total score at Week 26 was assessed along with multiple secondary endpoints evaluating improvement in disease-related and quality of life measures.

The study met its primary endpoint, with a statistically significant change in MG-ADL score from baseline through Week 26 for patients receiving ULTOMIRIS compared to those receiving placebo (ULTOMIRIS: -3.1, placebo: -1.4, treatment difference: -1.6, p&lt;0.001).

In the prospectively-defined secondary endpoints of change from baseline through Week 26 in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score – a physician-administered assessment of MG clinical severity – as well as the proportion of patients who achieved an improvement of at least 5 points in QMG, ULTOMIRIS also demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.005, respectively). Nearly three times as many patients receiving ULTOMIRIS experienced an improvement of at least 5 points in their QMG score compared to patients receiving placebo (30.0% vs 11.3%). These improvements in MG-ADL and QMG scores were observed as early as Week 1 and were sustained through Week 26.

Additional secondary endpoints assessing qualify of life measures, such as Revised 15-Component Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life (MG-QOL15r) score (p=0.064) and Neuro-QOL Fatigue score (p=0.373), did not meet statistical significance at Week 26. The proportion of patients who achieved an improvement of at least 3 points in MG-ADL score (ULTOMIRIS: 56.7%, placebo: 34.1%, nominal p=0.005), was not considered statistically significant based on hierarchical testing.

During the randomized controlled period, adverse events were comparable between the ULTOMIRIS and placebo groups. The most frequently observed adverse events were headache (ULTOMIRIS: 18.6%; placebo: 25.8%), diarrhea (ULTOMIRIS: 15.1%; placebo: 12.4%) and nausea (ULTOMIRIS: 10.5%; placebo: 10.1%). The most frequently observed serious adverse events were MG crisis (ULTOMIRIS: 1.2%) and MG worsening (placebo: 3.4%).

Through 52 weeks (26 weeks randomized controlled period + 26 weeks of open-label extension), there were four patient deaths in the ULTOMIRIS group – three of them were due to COVID-19 and none were considered related to treatment with ULTOMIRIS. No cases of meningococcal infection were observed through 52 weeks.

Patients who completed the randomized controlled period were eligible to continue into an open-label extension period evaluating the safety and efficacy of ULTOMIRIS for up to two years, which is ongoing. At the time of this preliminary analysis of the open-label extension period, 75 patients had completed 26 weeks of treatment, for a total of 52 weeks of treatment. Among the patients who received ULTOMIRIS in the randomized controlled period, the treatment effects were maintained through an additional 26 weeks of treatment, demonstrating sustained efficacy for a total of 52 weeks. In addition, patients who received placebo in the randomized controlled period and switched to ULTOMIRIS at the beginning of the open-label extension showed immediate and sustained improvement in MG-ADL and QMG scores in a similar magnitude and time course to that observed in the ULTOMIRIS group during the randomized controlled period.

<b>About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
</b>Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by severe muscle weakness. In gMG, inflammation causes damage at the connection point between nerve cells and the muscles they control (known as the neuromuscular junction or NMJ). This damage leads to a breakdown of communication between the brain and muscles, causing loss of muscle function and severe weakness.

About 85 percent of people with gMG produce specific antibodies that bind to the surface of the cells at the NMJ. This binding activates the complement cascade and causes the immune system to attack the NMJ. People with gMG can suffer from initial symptoms, such as slurred speech, droopy eyelids, double vision, and lack of balance, which can often lead to more severe symptoms like choking, impaired swallowing, extreme fatigue and even episodes of respiratory failure.

gMG can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins for women before the age of 40 and for men after the age of 60. The prevalence of gMG is estimated at 107 to 278 per million people.

<b>About ULTOMIRIS<sup>®
</sup></b>ULTOMIRIS<sup>®</sup> (ravulizumab) is the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor. The medication works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. ULTOMIRIS is administered intravenously every eight weeks or, for pediatric patients less than 20 kg, every four weeks, following a loading dose. ULTOMIRIS is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults and children (one month of age and older) with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), as well as in the European Union (EU) and Japan as a treatment for adults with PNH. It is also approved in the U.S. and Japan for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients, as well as in the EU for the treatment of adults and children with a body weight of at least 10 kg with aHUS.

<b>INDICATIONS &amp; IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION for ULTOMIRIS<sup>®</sup> (ravulizumab-cwvz)</b>

<b>INDICATIONS
What is ULTOMIRIS?
</b>ULTOMIRIS is a prescription medicine used to treat:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>adults and children 1 month of age and older with a disease called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH).</li>
 	<li>adults and children 1 month of age and older with a disease called atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). ULTOMIRIS is not used in treating people with Shiga toxin E. coli related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS).</li>
</ul>
It is not known if ULTOMIRIS is safe and effective in children younger than 1 month of age.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
What is the most important information I should know about ULTOMIRIS?
ULTOMIRIS is a medicine that affects your immune system and can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections.</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>ULTOMIRIS increases your chance of getting serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections that may quickly become life-threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early.</li>
</ul>
<ol class=""bwlistdecimal"">
 	<li>You must receive meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks before your first dose of ULTOMIRIS if you are not vaccinated.</li>
 	<li>If your doctor decided that urgent treatment with ULTOMIRIS is needed, you should receive meningococcal vaccination as soon as possible.</li>
 	<li>If you have not been vaccinated and ULTOMIRIS therapy must be initiated immediately, you should also receive 2 weeks of antibiotics with your vaccinations.</li>
 	<li>If you had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, you might need additional vaccination. Your doctor will decide if you need additional vaccination.</li>
 	<li>Meningococcal vaccines reduce but do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Call your doctor or get emergency medical care right away if you get any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection: headache with nausea or vomiting, headache and fever, headache with a stiff neck or stiff back, fever, fever and a rash, confusion, muscle aches with flu-like symptoms and eyes sensitive to light.</li>
</ol>
<b>Your doctor will give you a Patient Safety Card about the risk of meningococcal infection. </b>Carry it with you at all times during treatment and for 8 months after your last ULTOMIRIS dose. It is important to show this card to any doctor or nurse to help them diagnose and treat you quickly.

<b>ULTOMIRIS is only available through a program called the ULTOMIRIS REMS. </b>Before you can receive ULTOMIRIS, your doctor must: enroll in the ULTOMIRIS REMS program; counsel you about the risk of meningococcal infection; give you information and a <b>Patient Safety Card</b> about the symptoms and your risk of meningococcal infection (as discussed above); and make sure that you are vaccinated with a meningococcal vaccine, and if needed, get revaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine. Ask your doctor if you are not sure if you need to be revaccinated.

<b>ULTOMIRIS may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections. </b>Make sure your child receives vaccinations against <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> and <i>Haemophilis influenzae</i> type b (Hib) if treated with ULTOMIRIS. Call your doctor right away if you have any new signs or symptoms of infection.

<b>Who should not receive ULTOMIRIS?
Do not </b>receive ULTOMIRIS if you have a meningococcal infection or have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection unless your doctor decides that urgent treatment with ULTOMIRIS is needed.

<b>Before you receive ULTOMIRIS, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</b> have an infection or fever, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS will harm your unborn baby or if it passes into your breast milk. You should not breastfeed during treatment and for 8 months after your final dose of ULTOMIRIS.

<b>Tell your doctor about all the vaccines you receive and medicines you take, </b>including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements which could affect your treatment.

<b>If you have PNH and you stop receiving ULTOMIRIS, your doctor will need to monitor you closely for at least 16 weeks after you stop ULTOMIRIS. Stopping ULTOMIRIS may cause breakdown of your red blood cells due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen due to red blood cell breakdown include: </b>drop in your red blood cell count<b>, </b>tiredness<b>, </b>blood in your urine<b>, </b>stomach-area (abdomen) pain<b>, </b>shortness of breath<b>, </b>blood clots<b>, </b>trouble swallowing, and<b> </b>erectile dysfunction (ED) in males.

<b>If you have aHUS, your doctor will need to monitor you closely for at least 12 months after stopping treatment for signs of worsening aHUS or problems related to a type of abnormal clotting and breakdown of your red blood cells called thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Symptoms or problems that can happen with TMA may include: </b>confusion or loss of consciousness, seizures, chest pain (angina), difficulty breathing and blood clots or stroke.

<b>What are the possible side effects of ULTOMIRIS?</b>

<b>ULTOMIRIS can cause serious side effects including</b> <b>infusion-related reactions.</b> Symptoms of an infusion-related reaction with ULTOMIRIS may include lower back pain, feeling faint or discomfort in your arms or legs. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you develop these symptoms, or any other symptoms during your ULTOMIRIS infusion that may mean you are having a serious infusion reaction, including: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, tongue, or throat, and feel faint or pass out.

<b>The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people treated for PNH are upper respiratory tract infection and headache.</b>

<b>The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people with aHUS are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, high blood pressure and fever.</b>

<p align=""justify"">SAN FRANCISCO, July 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 2 MARCH (Monoclonal Antibody siRNA Combination against Hepatitis B) trial evaluating VIR-2218 together with VIR-3434 for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection – a combination designed to achieve a functional cure.</p>
<p align=""justify"">VIR-2218 is an investigational small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) designed to inhibit the production of all HBV proteins (X, polymerase, S and core), which may be acting as immune tolerogens. VIR-3434 is an investigational HBV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody designed to block entry of all 10 genotypes of HBV into hepatocytes, as well as reduce the level of virions and subviral particles in the blood. It has also been Fc engineered to include the XX2 “vaccinal mutation,” allowing it to potentially function as a therapeutic T cell vaccine against HBV.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“HBV infection remains an urgent global public health challenge associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and we believe that a combination approach focused on immune restoration will be critical to achieving a functional cure,” said Phil Pang, M.D., Ph.D., Vir’s chief medical officer. “We are excited about the potential of VIR-2218 to serve as the cornerstone of that approach. We believe that combining it with VIR-3434, which has already demonstrated the ability to markedly lower hepatitis B surface antigen at low doses in an ongoing Phase 1 trial, and, most importantly, has the potential to function as a therapeutic T cell vaccine, could be a game changer.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The multi-center, open-label Phase 2 trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination of VIR-2218 and VIR-3434 in approximately 90 adult patients (ages 18 to 65) with chronic HBV infection receiving nucleot(s)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy. Both VIR-2218 and VIR-3434 will be administered via subcutaneous injection at varying dose levels over the course of the trial for a treatment period ranging from four to 20 weeks, and a follow-up period of up to 116 weeks, depending on the dosing cohort. The primary endpoints of the trial are the proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events; grading of post-treatment clinical laboratory parameters; and the proportion of patients achieving a functional cure (defined as undetectable HBsAg and sustained suppression of HBV DNA).</p>
<strong class=""block"">About VIR-2218</strong>
<p align=""justify"">VIR-2218 is an investigational subcutaneously administered HBV-targeting siRNA that has the potential to stimulate an effective immune response and have direct antiviral activity against HBV. It is the first siRNA in the clinic to include Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry Plus (ESC+) technology to enhance stability and minimize off-target activity, which potentially can result in an increased therapeutic index. VIR-2218 is the first asset in the company’s collaboration with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to enter clinical trials.</p>
<strong class=""block"">About VIR-3434</strong>
<p align=""justify"">VIR-3434 is an investigational subcutaneously administered HBV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody designed to block entry of all 10 genotypes of HBV into hepatocytes and reduce the level of virions and subviral particles in the blood. VIR-3434, which has been Fc engineered to potentially function as a T cell vaccine against HBV in infected patients, also incorporates Xencor’s Xtend™ in order to have an extended half-life.</p>
<strong class=""block"">About Vir Biotechnology</strong>
<p align=""justify"">Vir Biotechnology is a clinical-stage immunology company focused on combining immunologic insights with cutting-edge technologies to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases. Vir has assembled four technology platforms that are designed to stimulate and enhance the immune system by exploiting critical observations of natural immune processes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","INDIANAPOLIS and PHOENIX, July 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Banner Alzheimer’s Institute today announced a strategic research collaboration as part of the planned Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating donanemab in participants at risk for cognitive and functional decline related to Alzheimer’s disease (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3). TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 will evaluate whether treatment with donanemab can slow the clinical progression of Alzheimer’s disease in trial participants.

As part of the collaboration, Banner will leverage its expertise and proven leadership in Alzheimer’s prevention trials, and support enrollment of trial participants with and without the e4 type of the apolipoprotein E (APOE4) gene through the Alzheimer’s Prevention Registry’s GeneMatch program. The collaboration will introduce a more virtual approach to the evaluation of Alzheimer’s prevention therapies. Lilly and Banner are committed to using the screening and treatment data as a shared scientific resource. Lilly remains the sole sponsor of the clinical trial and plans to begin enrollment later this year.

“This collaboration combines Lilly’s more than 30 years of dedication to Alzheimer’s research with Banner’s unique expertise and showcases our collective commitment to partner within the health care community to find potential treatments to end this devastating disease,” said Mark Mintun, M.D., vice president of pain and neurodegeneration, Lilly. “Our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 trial will evaluate whether donanemab can prevent clinical progression in patients who have evidence of Alzheimer’s pathology, but don’t yet demonstrate clinical symptoms. While these types of trials are challenging to enroll and conduct, Lilly, together with Banner, is proud to undertake the opportunity to bring about this new study in an area of high unmet medical need.”

“We are excited about the chance to work with Lilly in the effort to find an effective Alzheimer’s prevention therapy as soon as possible, introduce novel ways to increase the size, speed, and ease of participating in Alzheimer’s prevention trials, and do so in ways that might benefit the entire field,” said Eric M. Reiman, MD, Banner Alzheimer’s Institute executive director and one of the study’s lead principal investigators. “We must do everything we can to find and support the availability of effective prevention therapies for this devastating disease, and this trial includes several potentially transformational elements to help in this endeavor.”

Donanemab is an investigational antibody that targets a modified form of beta amyloid called N3pG. Results from a Phase 2 study of donanemab were announced earlier this year. Visit LillyMemoryTrials.com for additional information on enrolling in Alzheimer’s disease trials. Donanemab is also being studied in the ongoing Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study in early, symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease patients.

About Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory and other aspects of cognition. Dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of all cases1. There are currently over 50 million people living with dementia around the world, with numbers expected to increase to nearly 152 million by 20502. Almost 10 million new cases of dementia are diagnosed each year worldwide, implying one new case every 3 seconds, and a significant increase in the caregiving burden placed on society and families. In the US alone, there was an increase of 8 million new caregivers from 2015 to 20203. The current annual societal and economic cost of dementia is estimated at $1 trillion, an amount that is expected to double by 2030 unless we find a way to slow the disease2.

In an addition to age and family history of AD, the greatest risk factor for developing AD is the presence of the apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE4) allele.1 Having one APOE4 allele increases the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease by approximately three times compared with those with two copies of the APOE3 form. Those who inherit two copies of the APOE4 allele have an 8 – 12-fold risk.  In addition, those with the APOE4 allele are more likely to have beta-amyloid accumulation and Alzheimer’s dementia at a younger age than those with the APOE2 or APOE3 forms of the APOE gene.

GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced positive headline results from five studies of the Phase 3 ASCEND programme, evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of daprodustat, an investigational oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), for patients with anaemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The ASCEND programme showed that daprodustat met its primary efficacy endpoint in each study, demonstrating an improvement in haemoglobin (Hgb) levels in untreated patients and maintaining Hgb levels in patients treated with an erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA), a standard treatment option, in patients with anaemia of CKD. In addition, the key cardiovascular outcomes studies for non-dialysis (ASCEND-ND) and dialysis patients (ASCEND-D) demonstrated that daprodustat was non-inferior when compared to an ESA in the risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), the co-primary endpoint of both studies.

<strong>Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&amp;D, </strong><strong>GSK, said:</strong> “I am particularly pleased with the results from the ASCEND-ND and ASCEND-D studies given the importance of managing cardiovascular outcomes for patients who are currently suffering from anaemia due to chronic kidney disease, as well as the need to provide a convenient, oral treatment option. We will continue to analyse the data from the robust phase 3 ASCEND programme and look forward to working closely with regulators as we plan for our submissions.”

In addition to the ASCEND-D and ASCEND-ND studies, the programme also included studies focused on incident dialysis, for patients just starting dialysis (ASCEND-ID); quality of life measures (ASCEND-NHQ); as well as three-times weekly dosing regimens (ASCEND-TD). Each of the studies from the programme met its respective primary or co-primary endpoint(s). The programme enrolled over 8,000 patients who were treated for up to 3.75 years. The full results of the studies will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting later this year and will be used to inform regulatory pathways with health authorities worldwide.

Across the ASCEND programme, daprodustat was generally well tolerated in both non-dialysis and dialysis patients. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between treatment groups and the nature of reported events was consistent with the underlying patient population. The most commonly reported adverse events in patients receiving daprodustat across the ASCEND programme included hypertension, diarrhoea, dialysis hypotension, peripheral edema, and urinary tract infection.

Daprodustat is currently approved in Japan as Duvroq for patients with renal anaemia. It is not approved anywhere else in the world.

<strong>About daprodustat
</strong>Daprodustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), belongs to a novel class of oral medicines indicated for the treatment of anaemia due to chronic kidney disease in adult patients not on dialysis and on dialysis. Inhibition of oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase enzymes stabilises hypoxia-inducible factors, which can lead to transcription of erythropoietin and other genes involved in the correction of anaemia, similar to the physiological effects that occur in the body at high altitude. Daprodustat has been developed to provide a convenient oral treatment option for patients with anaemia associated with CKD.
