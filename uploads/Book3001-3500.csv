<span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span><span id=""spanHghlt0a18""> and</span> SUZHOU, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 23, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that SULINNO<sup>®</sup> (adalimumab injection), a recombinant human anti-TNF-a monoclonal antibody drug, has been officially approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), which is the fourth approved indication of SULINNO<sup>®</sup> in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. On <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2, 2020</span>, SULINNO<sup>®</sup> was approved by NMPA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is defined as arthritis with an unknown cause lasting at least 6 weeks in children aged 16 years or younger. Arthritis is divided into oligarthritis (&lt;5 joints)and polyarthritis. Polyarthritis can be further divided into rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarthritis and RF-positive polyarthritis. It is estimated RF-negative polyarticular JIA affects 1 to 4 per 100,000 children annually. Less commonly, RF-positive polyarticular JIA occurs in an estimated 0.3 to 0.7 per 100,000 children each year. JIA occurs in children at a young age, and is often accompanied by many complications that will lead to high rates of defects, disability and mortality when left untreated, deeply impacting the quality of life in children. Early aggressive therapy leads to improved outcomes and prevents potential disease complications.

Since the launch of adalimumab, it has been approved worldwide for the treatment of seventeen diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriasis arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, crohn's disease (including pediatric crohn's disease), ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, etc. The efficacy and safety of adalimumab has been well recognized globally, and adalimumab injection is widely used in the <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>. It has been consistently recommended in multiple diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of these diseases, and its significant efficacy has been universally recognized. SULINNO<sup>®</sup> is adalimumab biosimilar developed by Innovent, and its clinical results were published in the Inaugural Issue of <i>The Lancet Rheumatology</i> in 2019<i>. </i>The launch of SULINNO<sup>®</sup> has provided more Chinese patients with high-quality and relatively affordable adalimumab injection, bringing hope and opportunities to more patients.

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Qian Lei</span>, Senior Director of Medical Sciences and Strategies of Special Diseases of Innovent, stated: ""Not only does Juvenile idiopathic arthritic lead to functional impairment and decrease in quality of life and social participation in children, but also places a huge economic burden on their families. The approval of SULINNO<sup>®</sup> will provide a high-quality and accessible treatment option for children with polyarticular idiopathic arthritis in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. We hope that this product will benefit more children with polyarticular idiopathic arthritis and their families, allowing them to receive early treatment with high-quality biological drugs.''

<b>About SULINNO<sup>®</sup></b>

SULINNO<sup>®</sup> is an adalimumab (Humira<sup>®</sup>) biosimilar and a recombinant human anti-TNF-a monoclonal antibody independently developed by Innovent. TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine mainly produced by activated macrophages, natural killer cells and T lymphocytes, which is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Anti-TNF-a antibody can bind to human TNF-a monomer or trimer, block TNF-a binding to the cellular surface receptor, p55 and p75, and neutralize the cytotoxic effect of TNF-a, thereby inhibiting the release of TNF-a mediated inflammatory factors and cytokines, the adhesion and infiltration of inflammatory cells, the proliferation of fibroblasts and the activation of osteoclasts.

The results of a complete pre-clinical comparison showed that SULINNO<sup>®</sup> has similar in vitro biological activity (binding activity to target antigen TNF-a and neutralizing activity), physicochemical property and pharmacokinetic characteristics to those of Humira<sup>®</sup>. The similarities were also demonstrated in pharmacological and toxicological studies. The head-to-head clinical study comparing SULINNO<sup>®</sup> and Humira<sup>®</sup> conducted in patients with ankylosing spondylitis demonstrated a clinical similarity. The study results were published at Inaugural Issue of <i>The Lancet Rheumatology </i>in 2019.

<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca will unveil new developments across a range of stages and subtypes of breast cancer at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), which will be held virtually from 8 to 11 December 2020.

Key abstracts include:
<ul>
 	<li>New data from the DESTINY-Breast01 Phase II trial, which reinforce the durable efficacy seen with <i>Enhertu</i> (trastuzumab deruxtecan) in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer following two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens<i></i></li>
 	<li>New results from the SERENA-1 Phase I trial, which demonstrate strong efficacy and safety for a next-generation oral selective oestrogen receptor degrader (SERD), AZD9833 as a monotherapy and in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, in HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer<i></i></li>
</ul>
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “We are committed to transforming outcomes for women diagnosed or living with breast cancer by advancing a new generation of promising potential new medicines. The updates from the comprehensive DESTINY breast programme reflect the potential of <i>Enhertu</i> to help a wide range of breast cancer patients, while the encouraging data from the SERENA-1 Phase I trial paves the way for a clinical development programme to help patients with hormone receptor-positive disease.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Significant progress has been made to improve outcomes for those living with breast cancer but there is still much work to be done. At SABCS 2020, our dedication to transforming the lives of those living with breast cancer will be front and centre. With new updates from six different approved and potential new medicines, we are directly addressing patients’ greatest unmet needs and are potentially redefining treatment. Additionally, we are making an impact through collaborations with the scientific community to accelerate innovation.”

New, longer-term data from DESTINY-Breast01 to be presented at SABCS will highlight the updated efficacy and safety profiles of <i>Enhertu</i> in patients with previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with an additional 9.4 months of follow up.

Furthermore, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi Sankyo) will showcase several TiP abstracts that highlight how the companies are building on the impressive results of <i>Enhertu</i> in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. These include trials to explore the potential of <i>Enhertu</i> in earlier lines of treatment and stages of disease and in new breast cancer settings, including patients with low levels of HER2 expression. They also include combinations with other anti-cancer medicines such as paclitaxel, <i>Faslodex</i>, <i>Imfinzi</i> and the potential new medicine capivasertib, an AKT inhibitor.

AstraZeneca will present new efficacy and safety results from the dose escalation and expansion cohort of SERENA-1, a Phase I clinical trial of next-generation oral SERD AZD9833 as a monotherapy and in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in women with HR-positive breast cancer.

Building on the updated SERENA-1 findings, the Company will present two Phase II trial-in-progress (TiP) abstracts for the potential new medicine AZD9833, evaluating its efficacy and safety in previously treated post-menopausal women with advanced breast cancer and its biological effects in women with treatment-naïve early-stage breast cancer.

AstraZeneca is also presenting real-world evidence to understand outcomes for patients with germline BRCA mutations, and treatment patterns among patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The Company will also showcase data on the potential role of artificial intelligence and digital pathology in measuring levels of HER2 expression in patients with breast cancer.

Additionally, AstraZeneca recognises the important role of externally sponsored scientific research (ESR) in expanding the medical and scientific understanding of the Company’s medicines, and in identifying associated areas of unmet need in breast cancer. More than half of the AstraZeneca abstracts at this year’s SABCS are ESR trials with AstraZeneca medicines across various subtypes of breast cancer.

<b>AstraZeneca in breast cancer</b>

Driven by a growing understanding of breast cancer biology, AstraZeneca is starting to challenge, and redefine, the current clinical paradigm for how breast cancer is classified and treated to deliver even more effective treatments to patients in need – with the bold ambition to one day eliminate breast cancer as a cause of death.

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and promising compounds in development that leverage different mechanisms of action to address the biologically diverse breast cancer tumour environment. AstraZeneca aims to continue to transform outcomes for HR-positive breast cancer with foundational medicines <i>Faslodex</i> (fulvestrant) and <i>Zoladex </i>(goserelin) and the next-generation SERD and potential new medicine AZD9833. PARP inhibitor, <i>Lynparza </i>(olaparib) was the first targeted treatment option for metastatic breast cancer patients with an inherited BRCA mutation. AstraZeneca with MSD (Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in the US and Canada) continue to research <i>Lynparza</i> in metastatic breast cancer patients with an inherited BRCA mutation and are exploring new opportunities to treat these patients earlier in their disease state. Building on the first approval of <i>Enhertu, </i>a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate<i>,</i> in previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo are exploring its potential in earlier lines of treatment and in new breast cancer settings. To bring much needed treatment options to patients with triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of breast cancer, AstraZeneca is testing immunotherapy durvalumab<i> </i>in combination with other oncology medicines, including <i>Lynparza</i> and <i>Enhertu</i>, investigating the potential of AKT kinase inhibitor, capivasertib, in combination with chemotherapy, and collaborating with Daiichi Sankyo to explore the potential of TROP2-directed ADC, datopotamab deruxtecan (DS-1062).

<b>AstraZeneca in oncology</b>

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

By harnessing the power of six scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response, Antibody Drug Conjugates, Epigenetics, and Cell Therapies – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

<span class=""xn-location"">RARITAN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 2, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson, today announced the acquisition of rights to Hemera Biosciences, LLC's investigational gene therapy HMR59, administered as a one-time, outpatient, intravitreal injection to help preserve vision in patients with geographic atrophy, a late-stage and severe form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Financial terms of the transaction with Hemera Biosciences, a privately-owned biotechnology company, are not being disclosed.

&nbsp;

Patients with AMD often have low levels of CD59, a protein that protects the retina from damage caused by an essential part of the body's natural immune response called ""complement."" In geographic atrophy, an overactivity of complement destroys cells in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for central vision and seeing fine details, and results in a relentless progression to blindness. HMR59 is designed to increase the ability of retina cells to make a soluble form of CD59, helping to prevent further damage to the retina and preserve vision.

Geographic atrophy affects five million<sup>i </sup>people globally, and is a leading cause of blindness in people over 50 years of age. The prevalence of geographic atrophy increases as the global population ages with roughly one in 29 people over age 75 affected, and nearly one in four people over age 90. There are currently no available therapies other than vitamins and low vision aids.

""Geographic atrophy is a devastating form of AMD that impacts the ability to accomplish everyday tasks, such as reading, driving, cooking, or even seeing faces,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">James F. List</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular &amp; Metabolism, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""Our aim with this novel, single-administration gene therapy is to use our development expertise and deep heritage in vision care to help improve patient outcomes by intervening early, halting the progression to blindness, and preserving more years of sight.""

Gene therapy is an important modality for both therapeutic delivery and protein replacement, and one of the ways Janssen aims to significantly improve health outcomes for patients. Beginning with the eye, Janssen is rapidly developing expertise in the manufacturing, development, and commercialization of gene therapies across a range of mechanisms of action, building the case for future applications to other parts of the body.

""At Janssen, we pursue the best science to uncover transformational treatments that meet patient needs, which often means pioneering the solution. This is especially the case with gene therapy and late-stage eye diseases where the paths are largely uncharted,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Mathai Mammen</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research &amp; Development, Johnson &amp; Johnson. ""Through this acquisition, we are blazing the trail to bring innovative solutions to patients who are losing their vision.""

DARMSTADT, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">CAMBRIDGE, UK</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">NEW YORK</span>, Dec. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a leading science and technology company and Artios Pharma Limited (Artios), a leading DNA Damage Response (DDR) company developing a broad pipeline of precision medicines for the treatment of cancer, today announced a global three year strategic research collaboration to discover and develop multiple precision oncology drugs.

""Our platform has the potential to revolutionize targeted treatment in cancer and deliver on the promise of precision medicine. This collaboration will leverage the potential of our unique discovery platform of novel DNA repair nuclease inhibitors and targets that we have been developing. The partnership puts us in an exceptional position to focus internal efforts on our leading portfolio of assets which includes a small-molecule ATR inhibitor and a Pol? programme, both in candidate IND evaluation,"" <b>said</b><b> <span class=""xn-person"">Niall Martin</span>, Chief Executive Officer at Artios Pharma.</b>

""Targeting DNA damage response has the potential to provide an important therapeutic option for many patients in need of new treatments. We are excited about working with Artios to develop novel precision oncology medicines as we move towards changing the current paradigm in cancer treatment. This collaboration further strengthens our leadership and expertise in the field and discovery of DDR inhibitors and complements our multiple innovative assets currently being evaluated in several Phase I and Phase II clinical studies,"" <b>said </b><b><span class=""xn-person"">Andree Blaukat</span>, SVP and Head Translational Innovation Platform Oncology &amp; Immuno-Oncology, at Merck KGaA, </b><b>Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span></b><b>.</b>

<b>Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will leverage Artios's proprietary nuclease targeting discovery platform to jointly identify multiple synthetic lethal targets for precision oncology drug candidates. During this joint research collaboration, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span> will contribute its significant expertise and resources in the field of DDR and will have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize selected therapeutics discovered under the collaboration. The collaboration does not include Artios's lead programmes, Pol? and ATR inhibitors, for which Artios will retain all rights.</b>

Nucleases are critical enzymes involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Cancer cells are dependent on nucleases for their survival in response to DNA damage.  Also, in certain cancers which exhibit mutations in DNA damage response pathways, inhibiting key nucleases can lead to selective cancer cell killing i.e. synthetic lethality.

As part of the agreement, Artios will receive a payment of <span class=""xn-money"">US$30 million</span> in the form of an up-front and near-term payments. If Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span> chooses to exercise the option, subject to double-digit option fees, Artios will be eligible to receive up to <span class=""xn-money"">US$860 million</span> per target, in addition to up to double digit royalty payments on net sales of each product commercialized by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>.

Subject to certain conditions, Artios has opt-in rights for joint development and commercialization with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span> for the programmes.

<span class=""xn-location"">RARITAN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 3, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced today the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval of amivantamab for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The application marks the first-ever regulatory submission for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.<sup>1 </sup>The Company has also established an expanded access program (EAP) [<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3000641-1&amp;h=2730940341&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04599712%3Fterm%3Damivantamab%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&amp;a=NCT04599712"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">NCT04599712</a>]<sup>2</sup> for patients in the U.S. who may be eligible to obtain access to amivantamab during review of the BLA. For information about Janssen's pre-approval access program, visit <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3000641-1&amp;h=1049931638&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.janssen.com%2Fcompassionate-use-pre-approval-access&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.janssen.com%2Fcompassionate-use-pre-approval-access"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-use-pre-approval-access</a>.

Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human EGFR and mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumors with activating and resistance EGFR and MET mutations and amplifications.<sup>3,4,5,6</sup> In <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2020</span>, amivantamab <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3000641-1&amp;h=185287698&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jnj.com%2Fjanssen-announces-u-s-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-granted-for-jnj-6372-for-the-treatment-of-non-small-cell-lung-cancer&amp;a=received"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">received</a> Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for this population.<sup>7</sup>

""This submission marks an important step forward in our drive toward evolving the treatment landscape for patients with NSCLC who have EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and for whom there are no FDA-approved targeted treatment options,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Peter Lebowitz</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""We are committed to the development of therapies like amivantamab that progress precision medicine and target specific pathways, and to providing access through expanded access programs.""

The BLA submission for amivantamab is based on data from the monotherapy arm of the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study evaluating the safety and efficacy of amivantamab as a monotherapy and in combination with lazertinib*, a novel third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)<sup>8</sup>, in adult patients with advanced NSCLC.<sup>9</sup> In the study, investigators assessed efficacy using overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1** (RECIST v1.1), clinical benefit rate, and duration of response and progression-free survival, as well as the safety profile of amivantamab.<sup>8,10</sup> Early data about amivantamab as a monotherapy treatment in patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations were <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3000641-1&amp;h=2340054521&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.janssen.com%2Fjanssen-announces-phase-1-results-bispecific-antibody-amivantamab-treatment-patients-advanced-non&amp;a=presented"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">presented</a> at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2020 Virtual Scientific Program (<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3000641-1&amp;h=3778826453&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmeetinglibrary.asco.org%2Frecord%2F184802%2Fabstract&amp;a=Abstract+%239512"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Abstract #9512</a>).<sup>10 </sup>

""Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Given this significant unmet need, we at Johnson &amp; Johnson are committed to improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with this complex, deadly disease. With today's submission for amivantamab, we are one step closer to that goal,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Mathai Mammen</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research &amp; Development, Johnson &amp; Johnson. ""We are steadfast in our focus to advance novel therapeutics and medicines that will transform the trajectory of some of the most challenging and deadly diseases of our time, including lung cancer.""

EGFR mutations, leading to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and division<sup>11</sup>, are some of the most common mutations in NSCLC.<sup>12</sup> EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are the third most prevalent primary EGFR mutation.<sup>13</sup> However, EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are also often undetected.<sup>13</sup> Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is effective at detecting EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and broader use of NGS can help to detect these mutations.<sup>14</sup> Cancer driven by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is generally insensitive to approved EGFR TKI treatments and, in addition, carries a worse prognosis compared with cancer driven by more common EGFR mutations, including exon 19 deletions/L858R substitutions.<sup>15</sup> Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a median survival of less than 17 months,<sup>16</sup> which is much shorter than patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations, who have a median survival of 32-39 months.<sup>17</sup>

*In 2018, Janssen entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib.

**RECIST (version 1.1) refers to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, which is a standard way to measure how well solid tumors respond to treatment and is based on whether tumors shrink, stay the same, or get bigger.

<b>About </b><b>Amivantamab</b> <br class=""dnr"" />Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumors with activating and resistance EGFR mutations and MET mutations and amplifications.<sup>3,4,5,6 </sup>Amivantamab is pending regulatory review as a potential treatment for patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose tumors typically do not respond to current standard of care.<sup> </sup>Companion diagnostics to identify patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have been an integral part of the development program for amivantamab. The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.'s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBody<sup>®</sup> technology platform.

<b>About the Amivantamab Expanded Access Program Protocol (EAP)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The amivantamab EAP is for U.S. patients 18 years of age or older who have histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who are not amenable to curative therapy and whose disease has progressed during or after current standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy, who may benefit from treatment with amivantamab prior to its potential FDA approval.<sup>2</sup> The EAP has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients to be considered for enrollment in the program, and patients must not be eligible for another amivantamab study.<sup>2</sup> Interested patients should contact their physician to discuss whether they may be a candidate for amivantamab through the EAP.<sup>2</sup> Additional information about the expanded access protocol can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3000641-1&amp;h=2730940341&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04599712%3Fterm%3Damivantamab%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&amp;a=NCT04599712"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">NCT04599712</a>) and at <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3000641-1&amp;h=1049931638&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.janssen.com%2Fcompassionate-use-pre-approval-access&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.janssen.com%2Fcompassionate-use-pre-approval-access"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-use-pre-approval-access</a>.

<b>About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cancer, and NSCLC makes up 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers.<sup>18,19</sup> The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.<sup>19</sup> Among the most common driver mutations in NSCLC  are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase supporting cell growth and division.<sup>11</sup> EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of patients with NSCLC and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients who have NSCLC adenocarcinoma.<sup>20</sup> The five-year survival rate for all patients with metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs is less than 20 percent.<sup>21,22</sup> Estimated median overall survival for patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is shorter than in patients with common EGFR mutations.<sup>11</sup>

<span class=""xn-location"">DUBLIN</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 3, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ), along with its partner, PharmaMar (MSE: PHM), today announce results from the ATLANTIS Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, controlled study evaluating Zepzelca™ (lurbinectedin) in combination with doxorubicin versus physician's choice of topotecan or cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine (CAV) for adult patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) whose disease progressed following one prior platinum-containing line. Patients received lurbinectedin at 2.0mg/m<sup>2</sup> in the combination arm, which is lower than the FDA approved dose of <i>Zepzelca</i> at 3.2mg/m<sup>2</sup>.

The study did not meet the pre-specified criteria of significance for the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population comparing lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin to the control arm, though there was no adverse effect on OS with the experimental arm. Based on the study design, no additional hypotheses were formally tested. Importantly, key secondary and subgroup analyses favored the lurbinectedin combination arm. Lurbinectedin monotherapy was not tested in ATLANTIS.

The safety data in this study was consistent with the known safety profile of lurbinectedin monotherapy with no new safety signals observed. The experimental arm showed favorable safety and tolerability with regard to Grade-3 or greater drug related adverse events (AEs), deaths due to AEs, hematologic toxicity, dose reductions and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, compared to the control arm.

""Bringing <i>Zepzelca</i> to the U.S. market earlier this year alongside our partner, PharmaMar, was an important advance for adults with metastatic SCLC, an aggressive disease with a historically poor prognosis,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Robert Iannone M.D</span>., M.S.C.E., executive vice president, research and development of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. ""While the combination of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin did not achieve the primary endpoint in this study, the overall results support the activity and tolerability of lurbinectedin in this line of therapy. We look forward to the further development of lurbinectedin in SCLC and other tumors, both as monotherapy and in combination.""

""We remain committed to improving outcomes for patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer where there is a high unmet medical need; we continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lurbinectedin in SCLC and other tumors. The drug's activity in this disease and setting has been reinforced in this trial,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Luis Mora</span>, managing director, oncology business unit, PharmaMar. ""We extend our gratitude to the patients, physicians and their staff as well as caregivers who participated in this clinical study.""

""Historically, patients with relapsed SCLC often face difficult odds due to the aggressive nature of the disease and they have had very limited treatment options. As a physician treating patients with SCLC, I'm confident in lurbinectedin as an effective new option in this traditionally challenging therapeutic area,"" <span class=""xn-person"">Alberto Chiappori</span>, MD, senior member of oncology and medicine for the Department of Thoracic Oncology at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute and ATLANTIS Phase 3 study investigator.

Results will be discussed with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will be presented at a future medical meeting.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <i>Zepzelca </i>under accelerated approval in <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2020</span> for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The approval is based on ORR and duration of response demonstrated in an open-label, monotherapy clinical study. The companies will provide the ATLANTIS data to FDA and look forward to working with the agency to determine the confirmatory data that is needed for full approval.

<b>ATLANTIS Phase 3 Study Design<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The ATLANTIS Phase 3 study enrolled 613 patients at 154 sites primarily in the U.S., <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Latin America</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Western Europe</span> from <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2016</span> through <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2018</span>. Patients enrolled were =18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of limited or extensive stage SCLC, had failed one prior platinum-containing regimen, and had a chemotherapy-free interval (CTFI, time from the last dose of first-line chemotherapy to the occurrence of progressive disease) = 30 days. Patient inclusion criteria included small-cell carcinoma of unknown primary site with or without neuroendocrine features confirmed in histology test(s) performed on metastatic lesion(s) are eligible, if Ki-67/MIB-1 is expressed in &gt;50 percent of tumor cells.

In the trial, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin or physician's choice of topotecan OR cyclophosphamide/doxor ubicin/vincristine (CAV). The primary endpoint was overall survival. The secondary endpoints were 1) the difference in OS for patients in the lurbinectedin/doxorubicin arm compared to patients treated with CAV; 2) OS and progression free survival (PFS) in patients with or without CNS involvement; 3) PFS by independent review committee (IRC); 4) antitumor activity defined by objective response rate (ORR) per IRC; and 5) duration of response per IRC.

The study sample was stratified by the following factors: CTFI (chemotherapy free interval); ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1-2); CNS involvement vs. no involvement; prior immunotherapy against either programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1); and investigator preference of topotecan and CAV.

<b>About Zepzelca™<i> </i>(lurbinectedin)</b><br class=""dnr"" /><i>Zepzelca</i> is an alkylating drug that binds guanine residues within DNA. This triggers a cascade of events that can affect the activity of DNA binding proteins, including some transcription factors, and DNA repair pathways, resulting in disruption of the cell cycle and eventual cell death.<sup>1</sup>

<i>Zepzelca</i> for injection 4 mg is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with a kind of lung cancer called small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) and who have received treatment with chemotherapy that contains platinum, and it did not work or is no longer working. <i>Zepzelca</i> is approved based on response rate and how long the response lasted. Additional studies will further evaluate the benefit of <i>Zepzelca</i> for this use.

<p align=""justify""><strong>Leuven Belgium, 03 December 2020</strong>: reMYND NV, a clinical stage company developing innovative treatments for Alzheimer’s, diabetes and other diseases caused by cellular dysfunction, today announces commencement of a first-in-human trial of its wholly owned therapeutic candidate RES19-T.</p>
<p align=""justify"">As part of its transition into a clinical stage Company, reMYND has also strengthened its Board and senior leadership team with the appointment of Staph Leavenworth Bakali as Chair of the Board and Hermann Russ as Chief Medical Officer.</p>
<p align=""justify"">RES19-T, a first-in-class small molecule, represents a novel approach to treat Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), aiming to address the disease at its root and restore cognition in patients by reducing the cellular damage associated with memory loss. ReS19-T is the first in a pipeline of candidates developed using reMYND’s proprietary drug discovery platform, which identifies disease-modifying small molecule treatments and their novel target and mechanism of action to counteract the toxicity that leads to cellular dysfunction. reMYND has a broader pipeline of novel programs in development, with a diabetes program scheduled to begin in-human trials in mid-2021.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Prof. Philip Scheltens, MD, PhD, Neurologist and CEO of the Alzheimer Center Amsterdam commented</strong> “<em>I am very pleased to see this program enter the clinic. The reMYND team has been meticulous in their research, focussing on fundamental cellular processes related to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s, resulting in this novel and differentiated approach.</em></p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“Our hope, backed by promising pre-clinical and animal data, is that restoring calcium homeostasis, a process central in the Alzheimer’s disease cascade, will result in a reduction in synaptic damage and translate into improvement in function and biomarkers in patients. This is an important line of enquiry into this devastating disease and we look forward to learning more as the study progresses.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">The trial, a phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an adaptive dose design, will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ReS19-T in healthy subjects.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Studies in AD have shown that loss of memory is most closely linked to loss of synaptic plasticity, leading to neuronal degeneration. In four different preclinical models, ReS19-T has shown to robustly restore synaptic plasticity with an acute response and improve inflammation and AD pathology over a longer treatment duration, providing changes in recognized biomarkers for clinical translatability to symptomatic relief as well as disease modification.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Koen De Witte, Managing Director of reMYND commented “</strong><em>This is an exciting time for reMYND as we enter the clinic for the first time, representing a great step forward in our journey. Our vision is to develop new medicines which go beyond symptom relief and are able to</em><em> restore function in diseases caused by cellular dysfunction, with Alzheimer’s and diabetes as our two most advanced programs. We believe our unique drug discovery platform enables us to identify novel small molecules which will allow us to address the root of these diseases, counteracting and potentially reversing the damage caused by cellular dysfunction. The exceptional group of people we have been able to rally around our platform and programs as we move into the clinic speaks volumes about the quality and potential of the work we are doing.”</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","– FreeStyle Libre 2 system continuously measures glucose data every minute with customizable, optional real-time alarms1 to alert users when their glucose is high or low without scanning

– Now for children (ages 4 and older) and adults with diabetes, this latest technology sustains excellent performance for up to 14 days, providing trends, insights and actionable data on a reader or with the FreeStyle LibreLink mobile app – all at the same price as the current FreeStyle Libre system

– Latest sensor-based glucose monitoring technology will be available in the coming months to the more than 3.7 million Canadians with diabetes2

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Dec. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE:ABT) today announced its next-generation, sensor-based glucose monitoring technology, FreeStyle Libre 2, received approval by Health Canada for adults and children (4 and older) with diabetes. With new features such as optional, real-time alarms1 that measure glucose levels every minute, FreeStyle Libre 2 gives users the option to be alerted in real-time of critical events such as hypoglycemia (low glucose levels3) or hyperglycemia (high glucose levels4). The wearable technology, which eliminates the need for painful fingersticks5, also provides people with diabetes with excellent accuracy and actionable information to better manage their condition, and will be priced at the same cost as the current FreeStyle Libre system.

“For the millions of Canadians with diabetes, Abbott’s next-generation FreeStyle Libre 2 system expands on the life-changing capabilities of our original FreeStyle Libre system with enhanced accuracy, optional alarms and now available for children,” said Marie-Flore Nabor, general manager of Abbott’s diabetes care business in Canada. “This latest technology will transform the way diabetes is currently managed. The FreeStyle Libre 2 is designed to simplify this often complicated-to-manage condition and is accessible and affordable to people with diabetes in Canada.”

How FreeStyle Libre 2 Works

As the world leader in sensor-based glucose monitoring,6 Abbott continues to transform how people with diabetes test their glucose levels. Using Bluetooth technology, the FreeStyle Libre 2 system automatically alerts7 users when their glucose is high or low without needing to scan the sensor.

The FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor is worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days and measures glucose every minute to help users and their healthcare providers make informed treatment decisions. With a one-second scan using FreeStyle LibreLink, a smartphone app,8 or handheld reader, users can see their glucose reading, trend arrow and eight-hour history. Users can also share data with their physicians or family members via the LibreLinkUp mobile app.

Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 system utilizes the same proprietary wired enzyme technology as the FreeStyle Libre system, which was the first to remove painful fingersticks5 and is associated with better glucose control9, decreased time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia10, more time in optimal glucose range7, and improved HbA1C11.  A real-world study published in the British Medical Journal shows that the use of FreeStyle Libre system over one year is often associated with improved quality of life and that work absenteeism rate and diabetes-related hospital admissions decreased by two thirds.12

“Adding an alarm to this glucose sensing technology is definitely a major step to help people with diabetes live more confidently with less fear of high or low glucose levels,” said Dr. Bruce Perkins, M.D., Director, Leadership Sinai Centre for Diabetes and Clinician-Scientist, University of Toronto. “We have seen from research with similar technologies that this kind of innovation can improve glucose level control, and even prevent emergency room visits and hospitalizations. For kids and adults alike, it means less pain from fingersticks, much greater insight into patterns, and much more reassurance.”

Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 system will be available for people with diabetes ages 4 and up in Canada in the coming months.

As the #1 sensor-based glucose monitoring system used worldwide,6 Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre portfolio has changed the lives of more than 2.5 million people across more than 50 countries.  Abbott has also secured partial or full reimbursement for the FreeStyle Libre system in 37 countries, including Canada where residents of Ontario and Quebec13 who manage diabetes with insulin are covered. Other countries include France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.

GAINESVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Exactech, a developer and producer of innovative implants, instrumentation and smart technologies for joint replacement surgery, today announced the acquisition of Muvr Labs Inc, a pioneer in intelligent patient wearables and digital communication tools. The latest addition to Exactech’s Active Intelligence® platform of technologies, the Muvr portfolio is designed to help surgeons engage with their joint replacement patients throughout the journey of care.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

The Muvr platform includes patient wearables, mobile device applications and chatbot texting, which allow surgeons to remotely monitor patient recovery. The wearable device continuously provides the healthcare team with real-time data on each patient’s experience and recovery. Wireless sensors worn by the patient measure the individual’s range of motion, not simply steps taken. The patent-protected, self-calibrating design allows the patient to manage the wearable independently without additional in-person office visits and requires minimal intervention by the healthcare team.

Muvr’s corresponding tablet application provides surgeons a dashboard to easily identify at-risk patients and connect remotely for follow-up. The surgeon/patient chatbot is a customizable software application that automatically conducts text conversations to provide patient reminders and respond to patients’ most common questions. The Muvr technology is designed to reduce the surgical team’s workload while collecting pain scores, exercise adherence, mobility metrics and survey information.

“We are incredibly excited to join efforts with the team at Muvr to transform the relationship between patients and surgeons through this comprehensive care management platform,” said Darin Johnson, Exactech Chief Executive Officer. “This acquisition demonstrates our continued commitment to delivering personalized, data-driven solutions to improve patient outcomes.”

Orthopaedic surgeon Alexander Sah, MD, in Fremont, Calif. has seen the positive impact of Muvr technology on his practice. “Patients are attracted to the technology because they know our team is monitoring their progress; remarkably, this has caused my patients to take more ownership of their recovery,” he said. “We have already observed an increase in exercise time, patient satisfaction and a reduction in office calls. It’s also very simple to use because it doesn’t require in-office calibration, which allows patients to use the sensors, at home, unsupervised.

Pilot launch of the Muvr technology is slated for early 2021 with full release by year end. The company plans to further develop the technology to support shoulder and ankle replacement surgery.

BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced today results from pooled analyses of long-term follow-up from multiple clinical trials evaluating the use of IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> (ibrutinib) monotherapy and in combination as first-line treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with high-risk features. The data were presented at the 2020 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. Results from an integrated analysis of two clinical trials with up to 79 months of follow-up (Abstract #2220)<sup>1</sup> demonstrated similar progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rates (ORR) with ibrutinib in patients with or without high-risk genomic features, and further showed significant PFS and ORR benefits with ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil-based therapy regardless of genomic risk features.<sup>1</sup><strong>
</strong>
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

In addition, data with a median follow-up of more than four years were presented from a pooled analysis of 89 patients with high-risk CLL bearing TP53 aberrations from four clinical trials showing that first-line treatment with ibrutinib resulted in sustained efficacy, including PFS, suggesting that ibrutinib has meaningfully improved the poor prognosis in this high-risk population (Abstract #2219).<sup>2</sup>

“These large integrated data sets with follow-up up to six years, in addition to other data presented at the meeting in similar populations, contribute to the accumulating evidence supporting the clinically meaningful, long-term treatment benefit of ibrutinib as first-line therapy for patients with CLL,” said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. “Ibrutinib is an approved standard of care in first-line treatment of CLL, and the data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting further demonstrate the durability of responses in CLL patients with traditional high-risk features.”

Two additional studies will be presented in the oral sessions showing real-world treatment patterns or outcomes in patients with CLL treated outside of a clinical trial setting. The first study is a U.S. retrospective analysis describing treatment patterns and time to next treatment (TTNT) in patients with high-risk CLL treated with first-line ibrutinib or chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) (Abstract #372).<sup>3</sup> In this U.S. retrospective study, the largest of its kind to date, patients with high-risk CLL treated with single-agent ibrutinib had significantly longer TTNT compared with patients treated with first-line CIT.<sup>3</sup> In the second oral presentation, results from the U.S. informCLL™ registry (Abstract #547) highlighted infrequent prognostic biomarker testing rates prior to initiating CLL therapy, and limited use of such information to guide optimal treatment selection for many patients with high-risk CLL, suggesting an opportunity for additional education of healthcare providers.<sup>4</sup>

<b>Integrated Analysis of the Phase 3 RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE Trials Evaluated Outcomes of First-Line Ibrutinib in Patients with CLL and High-Risk Genomic Features with up to 6.5 Years Follow-up (Abstract #2220)<sup>1
</sup></b>Data were presented from a pooled analysis of two Phase 3 studies (RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE) with up to 79 months of follow-up evaluating ibrutinib-based therapy in first-line treatment of CLL patients with various high-risk genomic features.<sup>1</sup><b></b>

<b>Key Study Findings:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>In patients treated with ibrutinib-based therapy, PFS was comparable between patients with, versus without, specified high-risk genomic features, including del(17p)/TP53 mutated/BIRC3 mutated, the highest risk category.<sup>1</sup></li>
 	<li>At 42 months, PFS rates were significantly higher across all high-risk genomic subgroups in previously untreated patients treated with ibrutinib-based treatment (63 to 82 percent) compared with those receiving chlorambucil-based treatment (6 to 34 percent) with or without obinutuzumab, regardless of mutation.<sup>1</sup></li>
 	<li>At a median duration of ibrutinib<sup> </sup>treatment of 35.7-43.8 months across high-risk subgroups, there were no meaningful differences in the rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) of any Grade, or Grade 3 or greater AEs compared to those of the overall population.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
“Certain genomic abnormalities and mutations are predictors of inferior outcomes with chemoimmunotherapy in patients with CLL,” said Jan A. Burger,<sup>*</sup> M.D., Ph.D., Professor, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and principal study investigator. “Chemoimmunotherapy remains common in real-world practice despite evidence that shows small molecule inhibitor therapies like ibrutinib have demonstrated improved outcomes in high-risk patients compared to chemoimmunotherapy.”

“Since its first European approval in 2014, ibrutinib has redefined treatment paradigms for CLL, and these study results offer further evidence of the benefits and tolerability ibrutinib offers to CLL patients,” adds Dr Catherine Taylor, Vice President, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. “For high-risk CLL patients, the treatment landscape has advanced dramatically, with ibrutinib continuing to play a major role in defining what it means to live with genetic variations of this disease, which have historically poor outcomes.”

<b>Large, Pooled, Multi-Study Dataset Assessed Long-Term Benefit of First-Line Ibrutinib-Based Treatment in Patients with TP53 Aberrations with up to Four Years Follow-up (Abstract #2219)<sup>2
</sup></b>Data were presented from a pooled analysis of four clinical studies evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of first-line ibrutinib-based therapy in CLL patients with TP53 aberrations present.<sup>2</sup> The four studies were: RESONATE2; iLLUMINATE; the E1912 study designed and conducted by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); and the 1122e study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).<sup>2</sup>

<b>Key Study Findings:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>With a median follow-up of 50 months, median PFS was not reached (95% CI: 67 months to not estimable).<sup>2 </sup>At 48 months, the PFS rate was 79 percent and the OS rate was 88 percent among high-risk patients treated with ibrutinib monotherapy.<sup>2</sup></li>
 	<li>Additionally, 46 percent of patients with TP53 aberrations remained on ibrutinib treatment and 39 percent had a complete response.<sup>2</sup></li>
 	<li>No new safety signals were identified in this analysis and in general the rates of Grade =3 AEs of clinical interest declined after the first year of ibrutinib treatment.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<b>Clinical Outcomes Among Real-World Patients with CLL Initiating First-Line Ibrutinib or Chemoimmunotherapy Stratified by Risk Status: Results From a U.S. Retrospective Chart Review Study (Abstract #372)<sup>3
</sup></b>Data were presented as an oral presentation from a large real-world study comparing clinical outcomes (TTNT) in high-risk and non-high-risk patients with CLL receiving ibrutinib compared to CIT in the first-line setting.<sup>3</sup>

<b>Key Study Findings:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Data presented showed that high-risk patients receiving ibrutinib significantly prolonged TTNT compared to those receiving CIT.<sup>3</sup></li>
 	<li>Ibrutinib also provided sustained clinical benefit regardless of risk status, which is consistent with clinical trial results.<sup>5,6,7</sup></li>
 	<li>This study highlighted the need for cytogenetic/molecular testing before CIT treatment, consistent with clinical treatment guidelines.<sup>8,9</sup></li>
</ul>
<b>Real-World Prognostic Biomarker Testing, Treatment Patterns, And Dosing Among Patients With CLL From the informCLL™ Prospective Observational Registry (Abstract #547)
</b>An oral presentation on Monday, December 7, will feature results from the informCLL™ real-world prospective observational registry assessing treatment patterns in the era of novel agents.<sup>4</sup>

<b>Key Study Findings:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>The most common index treatment was ibrutinib; the majority of patients treated with ibrutinib remained on therapy at two-year follow-up; and CIT was also used for one-third of patients.<sup>4</sup></li>
 	<li>Data also demonstrated that prognostic biomarker testing rates were poor, especially for the biomarkers TP53 and IGHV.<sup>4</sup></li>
 	<li>Data from informCLL™ also indicate a ‘knowledge gap’ in terms of prognostic marker testing, interpretation and selection of optimal therapies for patients with high-risk disease.<sup>4</sup></li>

<b>About Ibrutinib
</b>Ibrutinib is a once-daily, first-in-class Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that is administered orally, and is jointly developed and commercialised by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.<sup>10</sup> Ibrutinib blocks the BTK protein; the BTK protein sends important signals that tell B cells to mature and produce antibodies. BTK signalling is needed by specific cancer cells to multiply and spread.<sup>11</sup> By blocking BTK, ibrutinib may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environments in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.<sup>12</sup>

Indications for which ibrutinib is approved in Europe include:<sup>10</sup>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): As a single agent or in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL, and as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy</li>
 	<li>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL): As a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL</li>
 	<li>Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM): As a single agent for the treatment of adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy or in first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy, and in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients</li>
</ul>
Ibrutinib is approved in more than 100 countries for at least one indication, and to date, has been used to treat more than 200,000 patients worldwide.<sup>13</sup>

<b>About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia
</b>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is typically a slow-growing blood cancer of the white blood cells.<sup>14</sup> The overall incidence of CLL in Europe is approximately 4.92 cases per 100,000 persons per year and is about 1.5 times more common in men than in women.<sup>15</sup> CLL is predominantly a disease of the elderly, with a median age of 72 years at diagnosis.<sup>16</sup>

The disease eventually progresses in the majority of patients, and they are faced with fewer treatment options with each relapse. Patients are often prescribed multiple lines of therapy as they relapse or become resistant to treatments.

SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kite, a Gilead Company (Nasdaq: GILD), today announced results from the primary analysis of ZUMA-5, a global, multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase 2 study evaluating Yescarta<sup>®</sup> (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) after at least two prior lines of therapy. After a single infusion of Yescarta, 92 percent of iNHL patients (n=104 evaluable for efficacy) responded, including 76 percent of patients achieving a complete response (CR) at a median follow-up of 17.5 months. The data are being presented in an oral session during the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition (Abstract #700). The presentation is also being considered for Best of ASH and has been selected for inclusion in the ASH Annual Meeting Press Program.

Based on these data, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and granted Priority Review designation for Yescarta for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) after two or more prior lines of systemic therapy, with a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of March 5, 2021. Yescarta has previously been granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA for these indications. If approved, Yescarta would become the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapy approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory indolent NHLs.

“It is encouraging to see this level of response to CAR T-cell therapy in a heavily pretreated and multiply relapsed patient population, in whom response duration to other available therapies is expected to be short,” said Caron A. Jacobson, MD, MMSc, Medical Director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Assistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School. “Our goal with treatment is to prolong overall survival, and the impressive durability following a one-time treatment of axicabtagene ciloleucel is incredibly promising for relapsed/refractory patients, who are often at a higher risk for early progression.”

Ninety-four percent of patients with relapsed or refractory FL (n=84) responded to Yescarta, including 80 percent of patients achieving a CR and 64 percent of patients in an ongoing response at a median follow-up of 17.5 months. Of patients with relapsed or refractory MZL (n=20), 85 percent responded to Yescarta, with 60 percent achieving a CR. Median duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were not reached.

In the safety analysis (n=146), Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (NEs) occurred in 7 percent and 19 percent of patients, respectively. Lower incidence of Grade 3 or higher NEs was observed in patients with FL (15 percent) compared to MZL (41 percent), and CRS rates were comparable between the two groups. There were three Grade 5 adverse events, including one patient with multisystem organ failure in the context of CRS related to treatment with Yescarta, one with aortic dissection unrelated to Yescarta treatment, and one with coccidioidomycosis infection unrelated to Yescarta treatment.

“As we continue to advance Kite’s cell therapy franchise, this analysis further demonstrates the practice-changing potential of Yescarta in additional hematologic malignancies,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Kite’s Global Head of Clinical Development. “We’re excited about the potential role of Yescarta in indolent NHL and look forward to continuing to work with the FDA to bring it to these patients as soon as possible.”

Kite has presented four-year survival data for Yescarta in the ZUMA-1 study of patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Based on these data and other data presented at ASH, Kite believes that Yescarta could bring the hope of survival to patients with a number of other hematological malignancies.

Yescarta has not been approved by any regulatory agency for the treatment of indolent NHL, including FL or MZL. Its safety and efficacy have not been established in these lymphomas.

Yescarta was the first CAR T-cell therapy to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from FL. Yescarta is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. The Yescarta U.S. Prescribing Information has a BOXED WARNING for the risks of CRS and neurologic toxicities, and Yescarta is approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) due to these risks; see below for Important Safety Information.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</span></b>

Follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) are both forms of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in which malignant tumors slowly grow but can become more aggressive over time.

FL is the most common form of indolent lymphoma and the second most common type of lymphoma globally. It accounts for approximately 22 percent of all lymphomas diagnosed worldwide. MZL is the third most common lymphoma, accounting for 8 to 12 percent of all B-cell NHLs.

Despite advances in management and substantial improvements in long-term survival, patients living with FL have varied outcomes. Currently, there are limited options for the treatment of relapsed or refractory FL and MZL after two or more lines of therapy.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About ZUMA-5</span></b>

ZUMA-5 is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 study that aims to enroll patients (=18 years old) with relapsed or refractory iNHL of either follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) subtypes, who received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody combined with an alkylating agent. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single infusion of Yescarta in this patient population. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by an independent review committee per the 2014 Lugano Classification. Secondary endpoints include CR rate, DOR, PFS, OS, safety and CAR T cell and cytokines levels. The study is ongoing.

<b>BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME AND NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Yescarta. Do not administer Yescarta to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Neurologic toxicities, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Yescarta, including concurrently with CRS or after CRS resolution. Monitor for neurologic toxicities after treatment with Yescarta. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Yescarta is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME</b> (CRS) occurred in 94% of patients, with 13% = Grade 3. Among patients who died after receiving Yescarta, 4 had ongoing CRS at death. The median time to onset was 2 days (range: 1-12 days) and median duration was 7 days (range: 2-58 days). Key manifestations include fever (78%), hypotension (41%), tachycardia (28%), hypoxia (22%), and chills (20%). Serious events that may be associated with CRS include cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, renal insufficiency, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome<i>.</i> Ensure that 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to Yescarta infusion. Following infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility, and for 4 weeks thereafter. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated.

<b>NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES</b> occurred in 87% of patients, 98% of which occurred within the first 8 weeks with a median time to onset of 4 days (range: 1-43 days) and a median duration of 17 days. Grade =3 occurred in 31% of patients. The most common neurologic toxicities included encephalopathy (57%), headache (44%), tremor (31%), dizziness (21%), aphasia (18%), delirium (17%), insomnia (9%), and anxiety (9%). Prolonged encephalopathy lasting up to 173 days was noted. Serious events including leukoencephalopathy and seizures, as well as fatal and serious cases of cerebral edema have occurred. Following Yescarta infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility, and for 4 weeks thereafter, and treat promptly.

<b>REMS: </b>Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Yescarta is available only through a restricted program called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program which requires that: Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer Yescarta must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements and must have on-site, immediate access to a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab for each patient for infusion within 2 hours after Yescarta infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS. Certified healthcare facilities must ensure that healthcare providers who prescribe, dispense, or administer Yescarta are trained about the management of CRS and neurologic toxicities.

<b>HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: </b>Allergic reactions, including serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis, may occur with the infusion of Yescarta.

<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS: </b>Severe or life-threatening infections occurred. Infections (all grades) occurred in 38% of patients. Grade =3 infections occurred in 23% of patients; those due to an unspecified pathogen occurred in 16% of patients, bacterial infections in 9%, and viral infections in 4%. Yescarta should not be administered to patients with clinically significant active systemic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic anti-microbials according to local guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 36% of patients and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. Perform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

<b>PROLONGED CYTOPENIAS:</b> Patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Yescarta infusion. Grade =3 cytopenias not resolved by Day 30 following Yescarta infusion occurred in 28% of patients and included thrombocytopenia (18%), neutropenia (15%), and anemia (3%). Monitor blood counts after infusion.

<b>HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA</b> and B-cell aplasia can occur. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 15% of patients. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following Yescarta treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Yescarta treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment.

<b>SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES</b> may develop. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that one occurs, contact Kite at 1-844-454-KITE (5483) to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.

<b>EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES:</b> Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following Yescarta infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</b> The most common (incidence =20%) include CRS, fever, hypotension, encephalopathy, tachycardia, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, chills, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, infections-pathogen unspecified, nausea, hypoxia, tremor, cough, vomiting, dizziness, constipation, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Basel, 5 December 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that new data from the pivotal phase III MURANO and CLL14 studies support the efficacy of fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free Venclexta®/Venclyxto® (venetoclax)-based combinations in certain people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and provide more evidence on the potential value of minimal residual disease (MRD). Data were presented at the all-virtual 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition on Saturday 5 December 2020.

“These results reinforce the long-term value of fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free Venclexta/Venclyxto-based combinations in CLL, potentially offering patients a significant period of time without treatment following initial therapy,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “These data also reflect our ongoing commitment to accelerating clinical advancements for patients by exploring the novel endpoint minimal residual disease as a potential predictor of patient outcomes.”

Five-year data from the pivotal phase III MURANO trial continue to show sustained investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) with Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera<sup>®</sup>/Rituxan<sup>® </sup>(rituximab). Data, presented in an oral session, showed:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 81% (HR= 0.19; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.26; p&lt;0.0001) compared to bendamustine plus MabThera/Rituxan (BR) in people with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CLL.</li>
 	<li>At the time of analysis, median overall survival (OS) had not been reached in either arm, however, five-year OS was 82.1% in the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan arm, compared to 62.2% in the BR arm (HR=0.40; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.62).</li>
 	<li>In the Venclexta/Venclyxto arm, among the 130 patients who completed two years of treatment without progressive disease, 63.8% (n=83/130) had undetectable MRD (uMRD) levels at the end of treatment. In an analysis of this patient subgroup, uMRD was associated with improved progression-free survival. Undetectable MRD, sometimes referred to as MRD-negativity, means that no cancer cells could be detected using a specific and highly sensitive test, and is defined as less than one cancer cell in 10,000 leukocytes.</li>
 	<li>No new safety events were reported in the study.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
Data from the phase III CLL14 study contributes to growing evidence regarding the potential of MRD measurements to predict future outcomes for certain people with previously untreated CLL who were treated with fixed-duration Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva<sup>®</sup>/Gazyvaro<sup>®</sup> (obinutuzumab):
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Patients with uMRD and a partial response (PR) had longer PFS than patients with detectable MRD and a complete response (CR).<sup>2</sup></li>
 	<li>In collaboration with Adaptive Biotechnologies, clonal growth rate, a measure for how quickly cancer cells grow, was analysed using the next-generation sequencing Adaptive clonoSEQ<sup>®</sup> Assay and insights were used to better understand the potential role of MRD in predicting outcomes. In this analysis, after treatment with fixed-duration Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro, the estimated clonal growth rate was slower and lower, suggesting more effective MRD eradication in these patients compared to those treated with Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil. Early data suggest a correlation between MRD responses and PFS, which will be further evaluated by the study authors.<sup>3</sup></li>
</ul>
Exploring novel endpoints, such as MRD, is an important area of development for Roche, which continues to investigate Venclexta/Venclyxto in a robust clinical development programme. This includes the phase III CRISTALLO trial in previously untreated CLL, which uses MRD as a primary endpoint.

Venclexta/Venclyxto is approved in the US and EU in combination with MabThera/Rituxan for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with Gazyva/Gazyvaro for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL; and as a monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in people who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.

Venclexta/Venclyxto is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the US, under the brand name Venclexta, and commercialised by AbbVie outside of the US.

*Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a measure of the number of remaining cancer cells. Undetectable MRD (uMRD), sometimes referred to as MRD-negativity, means that no cancer cells could be detected using a specific and highly sensitive test, and is defined as less than one cancer cell in 10,000 leukocytes.

All treatments were of fixed duration. Following a five-week dose ramp-up schedule for Venclexta/Venclyxto, patients on the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan arm received six cycles of Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan followed by Venclexta/Venclyxto monotherapy for up to two years total. Patients on the BR arm received six cycles of BR. The study included 389 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, with or without 17p deletion, who had been previously treated with at least one line of therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan or BR. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, overall response rate and complete response rate (with or without complete blood count recovery).

Arm A started with an initial dosing of Gazyva/Gazyvaro followed by a five-week Venclexta/Venclyxto dose ramp-up to help reduce the risk of tumour burden. The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed by independent review committee, minimal residual disease (MRD) status, overall response rate, complete response rate (with or without complete blood count recovery), overall survival, duration of response, event-free survival, time to next CLL treatment, and safety. MRD-negativity, or undetectable MRD, means no cancer can be detected using a specific and highly sensitive test, and was defined as less than one cancer cell in 10,000 leukocytes. The CLL14 study is being conducted in cooperation with the German CLL Study Group, headed by Michael Hallek, MD, University of Cologne.

<strong>About Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax)</strong>
Venclexta<sup>®</sup>/Venclyxto<sup>®</sup> is a first-in-class targeted medicine designed to selectively bind and inhibit the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers and other tumours, BCL-2 builds up and prevents cancer cells from dying or self-destructing, a process called apoptosis. Venclexta/Venclyxto blocks the BCL-2 protein and works to restore the process of apoptosis.

Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the US, and commercialised by AbbVie, under the brand name Venclyxto outside of the US. Together, the companies are committed to research with Venclexta/Venclyxto, which is currently being studied in clinical trials across several types of blood and other cancers.

In the US, Venclexta has been granted five Breakthrough Therapy Designations by the US Food and Drug Administration: one for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), two for relapsed or refractory CLL and two for previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia.<strong>

About Gazyva/Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab)
</strong>Gazyva<sup>®</sup>/Gazyvaro<sup>®</sup> is an engineered monoclonal antibody designed to attach to CD20, a protein expressed on certain B-cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells. Gazyva/Gazyvaro is designed to attack and destroy targeted B-cells both directly and together with the body's immune system.

Gazyva/Gazyvaro is currently approved in more than 90 countries in combination with chlorambucil for people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in more than 80 countries in combination with bendamustine for people with certain types of previously treated follicular lymphoma and in more than 70 countries in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.

Additional combination studies investigating Gazyva/Gazyvaro with other approved or investigational medicines, including cancer immunotherapies and small molecule inhibitors, are underway across a range of blood cancers.<strong>

About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia</strong>
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukaemia in the Western world. <sup>6</sup> CLL mainly affects men and the median age at diagnosis is about 70 years.<sup>7</sup> Worldwide, the incidence of all leukaemias is estimated to be over 400,000, with an incidence of over 100,000 in Europe.[8] CLL is estimated to affect around one-third of all people newly diagnosed with leukaemia.<sup>6</sup>

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

(WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Long-term follow-up results from the positive ACE-LY-004 Phase II trial showed patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) treated with CALQUENCE<sup>®</sup> (acalabrutinib) remained progression free for a median of 22 months, with median overall survival not yet reached at three years of follow-up. The safety and tolerability profile remained consistent.<sup>1 </sup>This data was presented at the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition on 6 December 2020.

MCL is typically an aggressive, rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that accounts for nearly 6% of all NHL cases and is mostly found in males during their early sixties.<sup>2,3</sup>

At a median follow up of 38.1 months (range: 0.3-59.5), 55 patients (44%) either remained on treatment (24 patients) or continued to be followed for survival (31 patients). The safety profile remained largely unchanged from the last analysis at 26 months, with only 14 patients (11%) having discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs).<sup>1</sup>

Michael L. Wang, MD, Professor, Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and principal investigator of the ACE-LY-004 Phase II trial, said: “Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive, difficult-to-treat blood cancer that is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage and often becomes resistant to treatment. This data shows that patients treated with acalabrutinib experienced deep responses over time, while the safety profile remained largely the same, including low rates of Grade 3/4 events, cardiac events and bleeding events, which are important in this patient population.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “These results add to the mounting evidence that CALQUENCE can provide sustained responses in patients over more than three years. CALQUENCE is an important chemo-free treatment option for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and is rapidly being embraced across the clinical and patient community.”

Additionally, an exploratory analysis of 30 patients meeting the criteria for minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation showed six patients (20%) achieved a complete response and undetectable MRD (uMRD) and maintained uMRD at last assessment.<sup>1</sup>

AEs in the trial remained largely unchanged with an additional year of follow up. The most frequent AEs of any grade (greater than or equal to 20% of patients) included headache (39%), diarrhea (37%), fatigue (30%), cough (23%), myalgia (22%) and nausea (22%), and were primarily Grade 1/2. Grade 3/4 AEs included neutropenia (11%), anemia (10%) and pneumonia (6%).<sup>1</sup>

Overall, 16 patients (13%) had cardiac AEs (11 with prior cardiac risk factors), with three of the 16 cardiac AEs occurring in the last year of follow up (two were Grade 3/4). Overall, six patients (5%) had Grade 3/4 cardiac AEs. One patient had Grade 3/4 hypertension in the last year (total any grade, n=5 [4%]; total Grade 3/4, n=2 [2%]), and five patients had bleeding AEs in the last year (total any grade, n=46 [37%]). Three patients had Grade 3/4 infections in the last year.<sup>1</sup>

<b>INDICATION AND USAGE</b>

CALQUENCE is a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

CALQUENCE is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT CALQUENCE<sup>®</sup> (acalabrutinib) capsules</b>

<b>Serious and Opportunistic Infections</b>

Fatal and serious infections, including opportunistic infections, have occurred in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE.

Serious or Grade 3 or higher infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal) occurred in 19% of 1029 patients exposed to CALQUENCE in clinical trials, most often due to respiratory tract infections (11% of all patients, including pneumonia in 6%). These infections predominantly occurred in the absence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, with neutropenic infection reported in 1.9% of all patients. Opportunistic infections in recipients of CALQUENCE have included, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus reactivation, fungal pneumonia, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, cytomegalovirus, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Consider prophylaxis in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat promptly.

<b>Hemorrhage</b>

Fatal and serious hemorrhagic events have occurred in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE. Major hemorrhage (serious or Grade 3 or higher bleeding or any central nervous system bleeding) occurred in 3.0% of patients, with fatal hemorrhage occurring in 0.1% of 1029 patients exposed to CALQUENCE in clinical trials. Bleeding events of any grade, excluding bruising and petechiae, occurred in 22% of patients.

Use of antithrombotic agents concomitantly with CALQUENCE may further increase the risk of hemorrhage. In clinical trials, major hemorrhage occurred in 2.7% of patients taking CALQUENCE without antithrombotic agents and 3.6% of patients taking CALQUENCE with antithrombotic agents. Consider the risks and benefits of antithrombotic agents when co-administered with CALQUENCE. Monitor patients for signs of bleeding.

Consider the benefit-risk of withholding CALQUENCE for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.

<b>Cytopenias</b>

Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (23%), anemia (8%), thrombocytopenia (7%), and lymphopenia (7%), developed in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE. Grade 4 neutropenia developed in 12% of patients. Monitor complete blood counts regularly during treatment. Interrupt treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue treatment as warranted.

<b>Second Primary Malignancies</b>

Second primary malignancies, including skin cancers and other solid tumors, occurred in 12% of 1029 patients exposed to CALQUENCE in clinical trials. The most frequent second primary malignancy was skin cancer, reported in 6% of patients. Monitor patients for skin cancers and advise protection from sun exposure.

<b>Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter</b>

Grade 3 atrial fibrillation or flutter occurred in 1.1% of 1029 patients treated with CALQUENCE, with all grades of atrial fibrillation or flutter reported in 4.1% of all patients. The risk may be increased in patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, previous arrhythmias, and acute infection. Monitor for symptoms of arrhythmia (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, syncope, dyspnea) and manage as appropriate.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>

The most common adverse reactions (= 20%) of any grade in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL were anemia,* thrombocytopenia,* headache (39%), neutropenia,* diarrhea (31%), fatigue (28%), myalgia (21%), and bruising (21%). The most common Grade = 3 non-hematological adverse reaction (reported in at least 2% of patients) was diarrhea (3.2%).

*Treatment-emergent decreases (all grades) of hemoglobin (46%), platelets (44%), and neutrophils (36%) were based on laboratory measurements and adverse reactions.

Dose reductions or discontinuations due to any adverse reaction were reported in 1.6% and 6.5% of patients, respectively. Increases in creatinine 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 4.8% of patients.

The most common adverse reactions (= 30%) of any grade in patients with CLL were anemia,* neutropenia,* thrombocytopenia,* headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and diarrhea.

*Treatment-emergent decreases (all grades) of hemoglobin, platelets, and neutrophils were based on laboratory measurements and adverse reactions.

In patients with previously untreated CLL exposed to CALQUENCE, fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 30 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2% for each treatment arm, most often from infection. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 39% of patients in the CALQUENCE plus obinutuzumab arm and 32% in the CALQUENCE monotherapy arm, most often due to events of pneumonia (7% and 2.8%, respectively).

Adverse reactions led to CALQUENCE dose reduction in 7% and 4% of patients in the CALQUENCE plus obinutuzumab arm (N=178) and CALQUENCE monotherapy arm (N=179), respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation in 11% and 10% of patients, respectively. Increases in creatinine 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 3.9% and 2.8% of patients in the CALQUENCE combination arm and monotherapy arm, respectively.

In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL exposed to CALQUENCE, serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients. Serious adverse reactions in &gt; 5% of patients who received CALQUENCE included lower respiratory tract infection (6%). Fatal adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of CALQUENCE occurred in 2.6% of patients, including from second primary malignancies and infection.

Adverse reactions led to CALQUENCE dose reduction in 3.9% of patients (N=154), dose interruptions in 34% of patients, most often due to respiratory tract infections followed by neutropenia, and discontinuation in 10% of patients, most frequently due to second primary malignancies followed by infection. Increases in creatinine 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.3% of patients who received CALQUENCE.

<b>DRUG INTERACTIONS</b>

<b>Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: </b>Avoid co-administration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. If a strong CYP3A inhibitor will be used short-term, interrupt CALQUENCE.

<b>Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: </b>When CALQUENCE is co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, reduce CALQUENCE dose to 100 mg once daily.

<b>Strong CYP3A Inducers: </b>Avoid co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer. If a strong CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided, increase the CALQUENCE dose to 200 mg approximately every 12 hours.

<b>Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: </b>If treatment with a gastric acid reducing agent is required, consider using an H2-receptor antagonist or an antacid. Take CALQUENCE 2 hours before taking an H2-receptor antagonist. Separate dosing with an antacid by at least 2 hours.

Avoid co-administration with proton pump inhibitors. Due to the long-lasting effect of proton pump inhibitors, separation of doses may not eliminate the interaction with CALQUENCE.

<b>SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</b>

Based on findings in animals, CALQUENCE may cause fetal harm and dystocia when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CALQUENCE therapy. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CALQUENCE and for at least 1 week following the last dose of CALQUENCE.

It is not known if CALQUENCE is present in human milk. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking CALQUENCE and for at least 2 weeks after the final dose. Avoid administration of CALQUENCE in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Dose modifications are not required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.

<b>Mantle cell lymphoma</b>

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an uncommon type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.<sup>5</sup> MCL comprises 3% to 6% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with an annual incidence of 0.5 per 100,000 population in Western countries; in the US, it was estimated that approximately 3,300 new cases of MCL were diagnosed in 2016.<sup>5,6</sup> The median age at diagnosis is 68 years, with MCL occurring more often in men than women. While MCL patients initially respond to treatment, there is a high relapse rate.<sup>5</sup>

<b>ACE-LY-004</b>

ACE-LY-004 is an open-label, single-arm Phase II clinical trial evaluating CALQUENCE in adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.<sup>7</sup> Adults with MCL and ECOG PS =2 who had relapsed or were refractory to 1-5 prior therapies, had no prior BTK/BCL-2 inhibitor exposure, and did not require warfarin/vitamin K antagonists, received oral CALQUENCE 100mg twice-daily until progressive disease or toxicity. Overall response rate (investigator-assessed partial response or better per Lugano classification), duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety were assessed. Minimal residual disease was analyzed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and peripheral blood by next-generation sequencing (5x10<sup>-6</sup>) in patients with available paired samples.<sup>1</sup>

<b>CALQUENCE</b>

CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) is a next-generation, selective inhibitor of BTK. CALQUENCE binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.<sup>4,8</sup> In B-cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.<sup>4</sup>

CALQUENCE is <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrazeneca.com%2Fmedia-centre%2Fpress-releases%2F2019%2Fcalquence-approved-in-the-us-for-adult-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukaemia-21112019.html%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DAstraZeneca%2520today%2520announced%2520that%2520the%2Csmall%2520lymphocytic%2520lymphoma%2520%2528SLL%2529.&amp;esheet=52343489&amp;newsitemid=20201206005037&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=approved&amp;index=5&amp;md5=d672044841bf40d1eeb9aa4d62bf3ea0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">approved</a> for the treatment of CLL and SLL in the US and is approved for CLL in the EU and several other countries worldwide. CALQUENCE is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy in the US and several other countries. CALQUENCE is not currently approved for the treatment of MCL in Europe.

As part of an extensive clinical development program, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating CALQUENCE in more than 20 company-sponsored clinical trials. CALQUENCE is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, follicular lymphoma, and other hematologic malignancies.

Basel, 7 December 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced results from a new analysis of pooled, three-year follow-up data of 401 people with haemophilia A from the pivotal HAVEN 1-4 studies, which reinforce the long-term efficacy and safety profile of Hemlibra® (emicizumab).<sup>[1] </sup>These data, from adults, adolescents and children with haemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors, were presented at the all-virtual 62<sup>nd</sup> American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, 5-8 December 2020.

“The long-term benefit of Hemlibra, with a consistent safety profile and durably effective control of bleeding, underscores its potential to redefine the standard of care for people living with haemophilia A,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “As the first new class of medicine in nearly 20 years, Hemlibra continues to show a positive impact on disease burden and quality of life for people with haemophilia A, regardless of their inhibitor status or age.”

The analysis included pooled data from 401 people with haemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors, from across the four pivotal HAVEN studies (HAVEN 1, n=113; HAVEN 2, n=88; HAVEN 3, n=152; HAVEN 4, n=48) with a median duration efficacy period of 120.4 weeks.<sup>[1] </sup>Hemlibra maintained low treated bleed rates across the study period, with model based annualised bleed rates (ABR) remaining low throughout the evaluation period at 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.7). Further, the proportion of participants who experienced zero treated bleeds (70.8-83.7%) increased with each consecutive 24-week period.<sup>[1] </sup>In addition, with Hemlibra prophylaxis, 95.1% of target joints were resolved.<sup>[1] </sup>Results showed that Hemlibra’s safety profile was consistent with previous observations and no new safety signals were observed after the longer follow-up.

Furthermore, the first interim analysis of the European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance (EUHASS) Database, also presented at the ASH Virtual Congress, suggests the safety profile of Hemlibra in the real-world setting is consistent with that seen in clinical trials, with no new or emerging safety signals. EUHASS is a large pharmacovigilance programme that monitors the safety of treatments for inherited bleeding disorders.<sup>[2]</sup>

Data from the HAVEN studies supported Hemlibra approvals to treat people with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in more than 90 countries worldwide and for people without factor VIII inhibitors in more than 80 countries worldwide, including the US, EU and Japan. Since its initial approval more than three years ago, 8,200 people have received Hemlibra globally, and in the US, Hemlibra is now the most prescribed preventative (prophylactic) treatment for haemophilia A.

<strong>About the Hemlibra clinical development programme
</strong>Hemlibra has been studied in one of the largest pivotal clinical trial programmes in haemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors, including eight phase III studies. The programme assesses the efficacy and safety of Hemlibra and its potential to help overcome current clinical challenges in the management of haemophilia A, including the short-lasting effects of existing treatments, the development of factor VIII inhibitors and the need for frequent venous access. Results from the HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2 studies supported approvals of Hemlibra for people with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with factor VIII inhibitors. These data, as well as results from the HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4 studies supported approvals of Hemlibra for people with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) without factor VIII inhibitors. Additional studies, HAVEN 5, HAVEN 6, HAVEN 7 and STASEY, reflect Roche’s ongoing commitment to continuing to characterise the safety and efficacy of Hemlibra and to addressing unmet needs for people living with haemophilia A.

<strong>About Hemlibra® (emicizumab)
</strong>Hemlibra is a bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody. It is designed to bring together factor IXa and factor X, proteins involved in the natural coagulation cascade, and restore the blood clotting process for people with haemophilia A. Hemlibra is a prophylactic (preventative) treatment that can be administered by an injection of a ready-to-use solution under the skin (subcutaneously) once-weekly, every two weeks or every four weeks (after an initial once-weekly dose for the first four weeks). Hemlibra was created by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and is being co-developed globally by Chugai, Roche and Genentech. It is marketed in the United States by Genentech as Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh), with kxwh as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration.
<strong>
About haemophilia A
</strong>Haemophilia A is an inherited, serious disorder in which a person’s blood does not clot properly, leading to uncontrolled and often spontaneous bleeding. Haemophilia A affects around 320,000 people worldwide,<sup>[3,4] </sup>approximately 50-60% of whom have a severe form of the disorder.<sup>[5] </sup>People with haemophilia A either lack or do not have enough of a clotting protein called factor VIII. In a healthy person, when a bleed occurs, factor VIII brings together the clotting factors IXa and X, which is a critical step in the formation of a blood clot to help stop bleeding. Depending on the severity of their disorder, people with haemophilia A can bleed frequently, especially into their joints or muscles.<sup>[3] </sup>These bleeds can present a significant health concern as they often cause pain and can lead to chronic swelling, deformity, reduced mobility, and long-term joint damage.<sup>[6] </sup>A serious complication of treatment is the development of inhibitors to factor VIII replacement therapies.<sup>[7] </sup>Inhibitors are antibodies developed by the body’s immune system that bind to and block the efficacy of replacement factor VIII,<sup>[8] </sup>making it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a level of factor VIII sufficient to control bleeding.

Basel, 07 December 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced longer-term data from the pivotal phase Ib/II GO29365 study, including data from a single-arm extension cohort of 106 additional patients, which show the benefit of Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin) plus bendamustine and MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab) (BR) in people with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. Updated data from the randomised cohort (n=80) show that with longer follow-up (48.9 months) a complete response (CR) rate of 42.5% (n=17/40) was maintained in patients following completion of treatment with Polivy plus BR, compared to 17.5% (n=7/40) with BR alone, indicating responses to the Polivy regimen were durable. No new or delayed safety signals were reported. Furthermore, new data from an extension cohort showed a CR rate of 38.7% (n=41/106) with Polivy plus BR. These results, which were presented as a poster (Abstract #3020) at the all-virtual 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition on 5-8 December 2020, further support the clinical benefit this Polivy-based combination brings to patients with this aggressive disease.

“Despite recent advances, treatment options are needed that can improve survival outcomes, enhance convenience, and support a good quality of life for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are encouraged by the continued survival benefit seen with this Polivy combination across a broad range of patients, which reinforces the positive impact that this off-the-shelf treatment option could have for people with this aggressive disease.”

Additional data from the randomised cohort also show that the survival benefit with Polivy plus BR persisted with longer follow-up. After 48.9 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.2 months with Polivy plus BR, versus 3.7 months for BR alone, as assessed by an independent review committee. Median overall survival (OS) was also sustained at 12.4 months for Polivy plus BR compared to 4.7 months for BR alone. New data from the extension cohort, which included 37 patients with second-line DLBCL were consistent with previously reported results from the GO29365 study, and show Polivy plus BR is effective in a broad range of patients. The median PFS was 6.6 months and median OS was 12.5 months with the Polivy combination. Sub-group analyses of this cohort also show that Polivy plus BR was effective in different patient populations, including high-risk patients, regardless of prior lines of therapy, with results from the pooled Polivy plus BR arms achieving a median OS of 7.6 months in primary refractory patients (n=55), and 32.0 months in non-primary refractory patients (n=97).

Based on initial results from the GO29365 study, in January 2020 Polivy was granted conditional marketing authorisation by the European Commission in combination with bendamustine and MabThera for the treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL, who are not candidates for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant. Prior to this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval of Polivy in combination with BR for the treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL, who have received at least two prior therapies. Beyond R/R disease, Polivy is also being investigated in first-line DLBCL, with results from the phase III POLARIX trial anticipated in 2021. Other ongoing studies include combinations of Polivy with Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® (obinutuzumab), Venclexta®/Venclyxto® (venetoclax) and CD20xCD3 bispecific antibodies mosunetuzumab and glofitamab to identify areas where Polivy has the potential to deliver benefit in areas of unmet need.

<strong>About the GO29365 study</strong>
GO29365 [<u><a title=""NCT02257567"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fIvFwOYsrHaLRIJHy8Zf6qPxa4WDOc5XG8t1P8Il86fXP3CmAKyhUhNYmqTRyGwSiDdc8bc_V3Zk2IKVgZl2NK2YlIY4GV0I6JR3aqrD6p_4yI1TzY8rny3_VMZCXilQ"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">NCT02257567</a></u>] is a global, phase Ib/II study evaluating the safety, tolerability and activity of Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin) in combination with bendamustine and MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab) (BR) or Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® (obinutuzumab) in relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Eligible patients were not candidates for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant at study entry. The phase II part of the study randomised 80 patients with heavily pre-treated R/R DLBCL to receive either BR, or BR in combination with Polivy for a fixed duration of six 21-day cycles. Of the patients enrolled, 80% had refractory disease. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) at the end of treatment, as measured by positron emission tomography and assessed by an independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR; CR and partial response) by investigator assessment and best ORR at the end of treatment by investigator and IRC assessment. Exploratory endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, event-free survival and overall survival. In addition to the randomised cohort of the study, an additional 106 patients were treated with Polivy plus BR in a single-arm extension cohort, also with CR as the primary endpoint.
<strong>
About Polivy</strong>®<strong> (polatuzumab vedotin)
</strong>Polivy is a first-in-class anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The CD79b protein is expressed specifically in the majority of B-cells (an immune cell impacted in some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)), making it a promising target for the development of new therapies.[1,2] Polivy binds to CD79b and destroys these B-cells through the delivery of an anti-cancer agent, which is thought to minimise the effects on normal cells.[3,4] Polivy is being developed by Roche using Seattle Genetics ADC technology and is currently being investigated for the treatment of NHL. Polivy is marketed in the US by Genentech as Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq), with piiq as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

<strong>About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)</strong>
DLBCL is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for about one in three cases of NHL.[5] DLBCL is an aggressive (fast-growing) type of NHL, which is generally responsive to treatment in the frontline.[6] However, as many as 40% of patients will relapse, at which time salvage therapy options are limited and survival is short.[6] Approximately 150,000 people worldwide are estimated to be diagnosed with DLBCL each year.[7]

<span class=""xn-location"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 6, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), today announced results from a long-term integrated analysis of two Phase 3 clinical studies and additional pooled analysis evaluating the effect of IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) based therapies for the first-line treatment of high-risk patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The totality of data featured at the virtual 2020 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting continues to establish the treatment benefit of IMBRUVICA for CLL patients with or without high-risk disease.

Results from an integrated analysis of two Phase 3 clinical trials (RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE) with up to 6.5 years of long-term follow-up investigating the use of IMBRUVICA-based therapies in patients with CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with first-line treatment showed similar progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rates (ORR) in patients with or without high-risk genomic features (Abstract #2220).<sup>1 </sup>

""We're excited to present long-term follow-up results at the ASH congress across multiple studies, including our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE, which showed continued PFS and ORR benefits across high-risk patients with previously untreated CLL,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Danelle James</span>, M.D., M.A.S., IMBRUVICA Clinical Development Lead, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.

Additionally, a pooled analysis across four clinical trials with up to 8 years of follow-up, including three Phase 3 studies (RESONATE-2, iLLUMINATE,  <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3003566-1&amp;h=392802123&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.abbvie.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Fimbruvica-ibrutinib-receives-11th-fda-approval.htM&A=E1912"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">E1912</a>), and the Phase 2 PCYC-1122e study - sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) - showed that first-line treatment with IMBRUVICA-based therapies resulted in sustained, long-term efficacy with high 4-year PFS rates in high-risk CLL patients, defined as del(17p) or TP53 gene mutations (Abstract 2219).<sup>2</sup>

""The presence of del(17p) or TP53 gene mutation is a strong negative predictor of survival in patients with CLL, and testing for these markers is important so patients receive optimal therapy,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">John Allan</span>, M.D., assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and principal study investigator of the pooled analysis. ""Although these patients remain at risk for disease progression, first-line treatment with ibrutinib based therapy may meaningfully improve the poor prognosis in this high-risk population.""

The informCLL™ real-world prospective observational registry assessing treatment patterns will be featured in an oral presentation. Data from this real-world evidence study showed low testing rates for prognostic and biomarker features among patients with CLL.<sup>3</sup> Further, when biomarker testing was performed, the selection of chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) continued for a considerable proportion of patients with del(17p)/TP53 mutational status, which is inconsistent with current guidelines (Abstract 547).<sup>4</sup><sup> </sup>As well, a retrospective, chart review study of real world patients featured as an oral presentation examined treatment patterns and time to next treatment (TTNT) in patients with CLL. Results showed high-risk patients with CLL treated with IMBRUVICA monotherapy had longer TTNT than those treated with CIT, and that IMBRUVICA therapy showed similar results in high risk and non-high-risk patients (Abstract 372).<sup>4</sup>

<b>Poster Presentation: <span class=""xn-chron"">Sunday, December 6, 2020</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">7:00 a.m. PST</span></b>

Data were presented from an integrated analysis of two Phase 3 studies evaluating IMBRUVICA-based therapy in the first-line treatment of CLL/SLL (RESONATE-2 and iLLUMINATE) to better understand outcomes in patients with various high-risk genomic features, including integrated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cytogenetics and single gene mutations.

In RESONATE-2 (NCT01722487), patients aged =65 years without del(17p) were randomized to single-agent IMBRUVICA or chlorambucil. In iLLUMINATE (NCT02264574), patients aged =65 years, or &lt;65 years with coexisting conditions or del(17p)/TP53 mutation, were randomized to IMBRUVICA plus obinutuzumab or chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab. The integrated analysis included 498 patients treated with first-line IMBRUVICA -based or chlorambucil-based therapy (n=249 each) with a median follow-up of 49.1 months. At 42 months, PFS rates were higher across high-risk genomic subgroups in patients treated with IMBRUVICA (63 to 82 percent) compared to those receiving chlorambucil with or without obinutuzumab (6 to 34 percent), and consistent PFS benefit with IMBRUVICA was observed across all high-risk genomic subgroups.<sup>1</sup> When comparing IMBRUVICA-treated patients with specific high-risk genomic features versus those without, results showed that PFS and ORR were comparable in the different subgroups, including patients with unmutated versus mutated immunoglobin heavy chain variable (IGHV) (PFS Hazard Ratio [HR], 1.79, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.99-3.24) or mutated versus not mutated NOTCH1 (PFS HR, 1.05, 95% CI 0.65-1.69). <sup>1</sup> Results also showed improved outcomes for patients with del(17p)/TP53 mutated/BIRC3 mutated, the highest risk category (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54-2.04).<sup> </sup><sup>1</sup><sup>,[5]</sup>

At a median duration of IMBRUVICA treatment of 35.7 to 43.8 months across these high-risk subgroups, there were no meaningful differences in the rates of treatment-emergent AEs of any grade or Grade 3 or higher AEs compared to those of the overall population. <sup>1</sup>

<b>Poster Presentation: Sunday, December 6, 2020 at 7:00 a.m. PST</b>

A pooled analysis of data across four studies to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of first-line IMBRUVICA-based therapy in patients with CLL bearing TP53 aberrations were presented. Eighty-nine patients with TP53 aberrations receiving first-line IMBRUVICA treatment were included in this pooled analysis. Median age was 65 years, and 69 percent of patients were male. Forty-five patients received IMBRUVICA as a single agent and 44 patients received IMBRUVICA in combination with an anti-CD20 agent.<sup>2</sup>

At 48 months, the PFS rate was 79 percent among these high-risk patients treated with IMBRUVICA-based therapy. <sup>2</sup> Median duration of IMBRUVICA treatment was 46 months. With a median follow-up of 50 months, median PFS was not reached (95% CI: 67 months to not estimable). <sup>2</sup>

At the current follow-up, 46 percent of patients with TP53 aberrations remained on IMBRUVICA treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were progressive disease (20 percent), study closure (12 percent), adverse events (AEs; 10 percent), withdrawal by patient (7 percent), death (3 percent), and other (1 percent). <sup>2</sup>

Grade 3 or greater AEs of clinical interest with up to 8 years of treatment with IMBRUVICA were infection (22 percent), most commonly pneumonia (7 percent); hypertension (13 percent), atrial fibrillation (12 percent), and major hemorrhage (7 percent).<sup>2</sup>

<b>Oral Presentation: Monday, December 7, 2020 at 8:15 a.m. PST</b>

Results from the informCLL™ real-world prospective observational registry assessing treatment patterns in the era of novel agents were presented in an oral session.

The registry fully enrolled with 1,461 patients, of whom 855 (59 percent) were previously untreated and 606 (41 percent) were relapsed/refractory.<sup>4</sup> Community-based practices enrolled 93 percent of the patients. <sup>4</sup> Patient demographics include a median age of 71 years; majority were male (64 percent), and 88 percent had an ECOG performance statue of 0/1.<sup>4</sup> Median follow-up for previously untreated patients was 14.9 months and 15.3 months for relapsed/refractory patients.<sup>4</sup>

Results showed the most common index treatment was IMBRUVICA; and CIT was the next most widely used treatment regimen for one-third of patients.<sup>4</sup> Data also showed that prognostic biomarker testing rates were poor, especially for TP53 and IGHV mutational status.<sup>4</sup> Data from the informCLL study also indicates a 'knowledge gap' in terms of importance of prognostic marker testing and appropriate selection of therapies for patients with high-risk disease.<sup>4</sup>

<b>Oral Presentation: Sunday, December 6, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. PST</b>

Results from a retrospective study comparing clinical outcomes in high-risk and non-high-risk patients with CLL receiving IMBRUVICA compared to those receiving chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) as first-line therapy were presented.

The analysis was performed by evaluating medical records from more than 40 U.S. clinical practices, included 271 patients with high-risk disease and 245 patients with non-high-risk CLL.<sup>3</sup> Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were balanced within each pair of comparison groups. <sup>3</sup> The median (range) follow-up for high-risk patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to CIT was 33.3 versus 35.3 months, respectively.<sup>3</sup> Additionally, the median (range) duration of first-line therapy for patients treated with IMBRUVICA was 28.6 months compared to 5.5 months for patients treated with CIT. <sup>3</sup>

The weighted analysis showed that high-risk patients treated with IMBRUVICA had significantly longer median TTNT and were 54 percent less likely to start a new treatment compared to high-risk patients treated with CIT (HR [95% CI]: 0.46 [0.34-0.62], p&lt;0.01).<sup>3</sup> During the available follow-up, more weighted high-risk patients treated with IMBRUVICA had only one line of treatment compared to weighted high-risk patients treated with CIT (74.7% vs 47.2%, respectively); more non-high-risk CIT patients had only one line of treatment compared to high-risk CIT patients (69.9% vs 45.8%, respectively); and more non-high-risk IMBRUVICA patients had only one line of treatment compared to high-risk IMBRUVICA patients (91.5% vs 81.7%, respectively).

Additionally, the majority of patients received a small molecular inhibitor therapy as second-line treatment. The most common second-line agents were IMBRUVICA monotherapy in the CIT groups (high-risk: 86.5%; non-HR: 83.7%) and venetoclax in the patients treated with first-line IMBRUVICA, either as monotherapy (high-risk: 37.5%; non-high-risk: 28.6%) or in combination with rituximab (high-risk: 28.1%; non-high-risk: 28.6%).

Results from the Kaplan-Meyer analysis showed that weighted high-risk IMBRUVICA patients had significantly longer median TTNT and were 54 percent less likely to start a new treatment compared to high-risk CIT patients (HR 95% CI: 0.46 [0.34-0.62]; p&lt;0.01). For the high-risk patients receiving CIT versus non-high-risk patients receiving CIT, high-risk patients had a significantly shorter median TTNT and were 2.43 times more likely to start a new treatment (HR [95% CI]: 2.43 [1.58-3.47]; p&lt;0.01). <sup>3</sup> No significant differences were noted in TTNT between high-risk and non-high-risk groups receiving IMBRUVICA, with median TTNT not reached (HR [95% CI]: 2.2 [0.96-4.96]; p=0.06). <sup>3</sup>

<b>About IMBRUVICA</b>

IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) is an oral, once-daily medicine that works differently than chemotherapy as it blocks a protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). The BTK protein sends important signals that tell B cells to mature and produce antibodies. BTK signaling is needed by specific cancer cells to multiply and spread.<sup>6,7</sup> By blocking BTK, IMBRUVICA may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environments in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.<sup>8</sup>

Since its launch in 2013, IMBRUVICA has received 11 FDA approvals across six disease areas: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with or without 17p deletion (del17p); small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with or without del17p; Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM); previously-treated patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)*; previously-treated patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy* – and previously-treated patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy<sup>.9</sup>

IMBRUVICA is now approved in more than 100 countries and has been used to treat more than 200,000 patients worldwide across its approved indications. IMBRUVICA is the only FDA-approved medicine in WM and cGVHD. IMBRUVICA has been granted four Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA. This designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases. IMBRUVICA was one of the first medicines to receive FDA approval via the Breakthrough Therapy Designation pathway.

In early 2019, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN® ), a not-for-profit alliance of 28 leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education, recommends ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA) as a preferred regimen for the initial treatment of CLL/SLL. In <span class=""xn-chron"">February 2020</span>, the NCCN Guidelines® were updated to elevate IMBRUVICA with or without rituximab from other recommended regimens to a preferred regimen for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL. In <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2020</span>, the NCCN guidelines were updated to elevate IMBRUVICA with or without rituximab as the only Category 1 preferred regimen for treatment-naïve WM patients.

IMBRUVICA is being studied alone and in combination with other treatments in several blood and solid tumor cancers and other serious illnesses. IMBRUVICA is the most comprehensively studied BTK inhibitor, with more than 150 ongoing clinical trials. There are approximately 30 ongoing company-sponsored trials, 10 of which are in Phase 3, and more than 100 investigator-sponsored trials and external collaborations that are active around the world.

<span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 7, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NKTR) today announced two nonclinical data presentations for NKTR-255, its IL-15 pathway agonist, at the 62<sup>nd</sup> American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. The presentations include an oral presentation of translational research studies conducted in collaboration with researchers from Dana-Farber Cancer Center.

NKTR-255 is an interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist that is designed to expand both natural killer (NK) cells and memory CD8 T cell populations. It is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical studies in both hematological and solid tumors in combination with agents that induce antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC). In the hematological setting, NKTR-255 is being tested in a Phase <span class=""xn-money"">1b</span>/2 clinical study as monotherapy and in combination with rituximab or daratumumab in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It is also being evaluated in a Phase <span class=""xn-money"">1b</span>/2 solid tumor trial in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

""Inhibition of NK cell effector functions is a mechanism for immune evasion in patients with multiple myeloma and therefore restoring and enhancing NK cell functionality is a key goal for new immunotherapeutic approaches, "" said <span class=""xn-person"">Nikhil C. Munshi</span>, MD, Professor of Medicine at <span class=""xn-org"">Harvard Medical School</span>, Director of Basic and Correlative Science, and Associate Director of the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""In our studies, we found the novel IL-15 receptor agonist, NKTR-255, was effective in reverting the inhibitory status observed in NK cells from MM patients, leading to enhanced direct NK cytotoxicity against several MM cell lines and primary MM cells. In addition, we saw a significant increase in ADCC activity <i>in vitro</i> with NKTR-255 in combination with myeloma-targeting antibodies as compared to activity with those antibodies alone. These data accentuate the potential for NKTR-255 as an innovative immunotherapeutic agent in the treatment of multiple myeloma.""

""The ASH presentations add to the growing body of data for NKTR-255 that highlight its ability to enhance NK cell effector function and greatly potentiate the ADCC mechanisms of targeted antibodies,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jonathan Zalevsky</span>, Ph.D., Chief Research &amp; Development Officer at Nektar. ""We are excited about the development potential of NKTR-255, especially as we've already observed biological activity in the first multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients treated in the monotherapy dose-escalation phase of our liquid tumor study.""

Details of the preclinical data presentations at ASH are listed below and are available on the scientific section of Nektar's website at <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3004658-1&amp;h=3605608573&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nektar.com%2Fscience%2Fscientific-posters-and-presentations&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nektar.com%2Fscience%2Fscientific-posters-and-presentations"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">http://www.nektar.com/science/scientific-posters-and-presentations</a>:

<b>About NKTR-255</b>

NKTR-255 is an IL-15 receptor agonist designed to activate the IL-15 pathway and expand NK cells and promote the survival and expansion of memory CD8+ T cells without inducing suppressive regulatory T cells. Through optimal engagement of the IL-15Ra/IL-2Rß? receptor complex, NKTR-255 enhances functional NK cell population and formation of long-term immunological memory, which may lead to sustained anti-tumor immune response. NKTR-255 is uniquely designed to overcome the challenges of recombinant IL-15 and other IL-15 agonists, which are rapidly cleared from the body and have shown diminishing response to successive doses.<sup>1</sup> NKTR-255 was designed using Nektar's polymer conjugation technology to extend circulating half-life.

<b>About CAR-T cell therapy</b>

T cells are a type of white blood cell that are critical in eliminating the body of abnormal and cancerous cells in healthy individuals. In cancer patients, these T cells frequently fail to either recognize or effectively engage cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapies involve engineering a human T cell to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that increases its ability to recognize cancer cells. These therapies use the immune system to fight cancer and have the potential to disrupt cancer care and potentially even provide a cure. Mesothelin is a tumor-specific antigen that is commonly expressed at high levels on the cell surface in many aggressive solid tumors and is an attractive target for immune-based therapies, including CAR T therapy.

<b>About Bayer’s new Cell &amp; Gene Therapy (C&amp;GT) Unit</b>

In order to build up its presence in C&amp;GT, Bayer is strengthening its internal C&amp;GT capabilities. At the same time, the company is pursuing external strategic collaborations, technology acquisitions and licensing. The goal is to build robust platforms with broad application across different therapeutic areas. Strategically, Bayer focuses on selected areas of C&amp;GT, such as stem cell therapies (with focus on induced pluripotent cells or iPSCs), gene augmentation, gene editing and allogeneic cell therapies in different indications. Leveraging external innovation together with the expertise of the teams at Bayer represents a key value-driver, especially in the highly dynamic and competitive field of C&amp;GT. Bayer’s operating model for C&amp;GT, where partners operate autonomously and are fully accountable to develop and progress their portfolio and technology, is essential for preserving their entrepreneurial culture and positions Bayer as a partner of choice. The role of Bayer’s C&amp;GT Platform is to steer strategically, ensuring the different parts of the organization complement each other and combining the best in Biotech and Pharma know-how. As part of the Pharmaceuticals Division, the C&amp;GT Platform will combine multiple backbone functions providing support across the entire value chain for the research and development of cell and gene therapies. This includes expertise in Research and Preclinical Development, CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls), Clinical Development, Commercial, Strategy Implementation and Project Management. With a high level of flexibility, it will orchestrate operations from science to launch in order to generate and maintain a sustainable pipeline, with the goal to bring new products to market as fast as possible.

<b>About Atara’s Mesothelin CAR-T Franchise</b>

Two of Atara’s investigational CAR T immunotherapy programs, developed in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), target mesothelin—the autologous ATA2271 program and allogeneic ATA3271 program. Mesothelin is a tumor-specific antigen that is commonly expressed at high levels on the cell surface in many aggressive solid tumors including mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer.

Both ATA2271 and ATA3271 are engineered for use in solid tumors as they incorporate Atara’s novel inclusion of both a PD-1 DNR construct to overcome checkpoint inhibition and a 1XX costimulatory domain on the CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) to enhance expansion and functional persistence of the CAR T cells. ATA3271, the allogeneic version of this CAR T, leverages Atara’s EBV T-cell platform and is currently in IND-enabling studies. ATA2271, the autologous version has enrolled the first patient in an open-label, single-arm Phase 1 clinical study in November 2020.

53291,Qiagen Launches QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 RUO Solution for COVID-19,"HILDEN, Germany & GERMANTOWN, Md.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–QIAGEN N.V. (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) announced today the launch of its QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 RUO solution that can detect T-cell responses of the human immune system to the pathogen that causes COVID-19, which could help researchers find out more about immunity levels and disease progression.
 
 Studies suggest that T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 declines much more slowly than antibody response, which presents several benefits to researchers who want to push beyond the existing detection of active infections to screen for potential courses of the illness and long-term immune responses to it. QIAGEN’s QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 Research Use Only (RUO) solution could be a valuable tool in this research.
 
 There is also growing evidence that T-cell response gives a reliable indication of how severe the course of an illness triggered by SARS-CoV-2 will be in infected patients, and how immune those who have recovered remain months – possibly even years – after having been infected.
 
 QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 RUO is a flexible, modular system designed to meet a wide range of research demands. It is based on QIAGEN’s easy-to-use QuantiFERON technology, pioneered in the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test for latent tuberculosis and recognized worldwide for its ability to detect interferon gamma that T-cells release upon contact with certain pathogens.
 
 QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 RUO is a crucial addition to QIAGEN’s growing COVID-19 portfolio that already provides sample-preparation technology, infection testing with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, antibody and antigen tests, enzymes and automation solutions.

VET2-L2 is in preclinical stage.

This collaboration, which combines KaliVir's expertise in the development of oncolytic viruses with Astellas' capabilities in advanced drug development and its global business experience, will enable both parties to develop new Immuno-Oncology therapies.

Under the terms of the agreement, Astellas will pay to KaliVir up to <span class=""xn-money"">US$56 million</span> in the form of an upfront payment and other payments to support research and preclinical activities related to VET2-L2 and the Second Product.  Additionally, Astellas may pay up to <span class=""xn-money"">US$307 million</span> and up to <span class=""xn-money"">US$271 million</span> for development, regulatory and commercialization of VET2-L2 and Second Product, respectively. Astellas also may make royalty payments on net sales of each licensed product.

""We are thrilled that Astellas has chosen KaliVir, and specifically VET2-L2, our lead product candidate, to add to their oncology program.  VET2-L2, a multi-mechanistic, intravenously-delivered oncolytic vaccinia virus, has demonstrated strong <span id=""spanHghlt1b1c"">preclinical </span>data prompting us to plan our initial clinical trial for VET2-L2,"" said  KaliVir CEO <span class=""xn-person"">Helena Chaye</span>, Ph.D., J.D. ""With Astellas' excellent track record for drug development and commercialization, we believe that their commitment to collaborating with KaliVir represents strong third-party validation for our VET platform.  We are <span id=""spanHghlta250"">committed</span> to bringing this exciting product to cancer patients and believe that our collaboration with Astellas will expedite our ability to do this.""

<span class=""xn-person"">Naoki Okamura</span>, Representative Director, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, at Astellas said, ""We, at Astellas, have positioned Immuno-Oncology as one of the Primary Focuses of our R&amp;D strategy, and we are committed to developing the next generation of Immuno-Oncology therapies through new modalities and technologies. Oncolytic viruses are one of the therapies in which we are particularly focused as we strive to provide new options for patients who have no effective treatment options.

tomography (OCT) image solutions using Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the assessment of
disease activity. The study will be conducted in several clinical centers in numerous
European countries and Canada, involving more than 500 patients.
For this study, RetinAI will provide its CE-marked web-based software platform, RetinAI
Discovery®, a data management platform to efficiently process data at scale across
imaging platforms and devices. Discovery is used today by professionals to navigate
imaging data, compute imaging biomarkers and track changes over time for some of the
most common forms of eye diseases. RetinAI’s tools also support diagnostic analyses and
clinical workflows as well as patient monitoring &amp; adherence to treatment.
Dirk Sauer, PhD, Global Development Head of the Ophthalmology Franchise at Novartis
Pharma AG, sees RetinAI as a strategic partner for advancing eye care through digital
innovation: “With previous projects, RetinAI’s services have enabled us to enhance and more
efficiently structure retina scans and data collected from our clinical studies. Together with RetinAI,
we are working on end-to-end solutions to generate swift and comprehensive disease insights to
better treat patients and improve patient outcomes.”
Dr. Carlos Ciller, CEO of RetinAI, commented “RetinAI is excited to expand and intensify our
partnership with Novartis who is one of the top pharma companies in ophthalmology with deep
competence, dedication and focus on digital innovation in eye care. We clearly see the value that
RetinAI can bring to Novartis. Our Discovery platform and AI tools are enablers to increase
efficiency in research and clinical studies and we expect they can also improve medications and
treatments for patients. We believe using RetinAI’s technologies for data from patients treated with
ophthalmic medications will provide enhanced disease insights and create opportunities for more
precise treatments.""

<strong>Basel, </strong><strong>December</strong> <strong>8</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>20</strong><strong>20</strong> — Detailed results from the Phase III ASCEMBL study demonstrate that, at 24 weeks, asciminib (ABL001) – a novel investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP) – nearly doubled the major molecular response (MMR) rate compared to Bosulif<sup>® </sup>(bosutinib)* (25.5% vs. 13.2%, respectively ([95% CI, 2.19-22.3]; 2-sided P=0.029) in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs)<sup>1</sup>. These data were presented today at a late-breaking abstracts session during the 62<sup>nd</sup> American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting &amp; Exposition (ASH).

“These important comparative data are impressive, and they reinforce the critical role asciminib may play, if approved, in overcoming the treatment challenges we face in later treatment lines of chronic-phase CML,” said Dr. Michael J. Mauro**, Member and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Program Leader at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Professor at Weill Cornell Medicine. “While the advent and expansion of TKI therapies has resulted in tremendous progress for patients living with CML over the last decades, many of our patients in later treatment lines still face inadequate response, disease progression and intolerable side effects.”

Despite the significant advances in the CML treatment landscape, many patients treated with two or more TKIs experience intolerance; for example, in an analysis of studies in patients who had previously failed two TKIs, up to 55% reported intolerance to treatment<sup>8-13</sup>. In addition, resistance rates for patients in later treatment lines remain high; and in the second-line setting, at least three out of five patients are unable to achieve MMR and up to 56% of patients do not achieve complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) within two years of follow-up<sup>5,</sup><sup>13</sup><sup>-</sup><sup>18</sup>. With few remaining treatment options, and no currently established standard-of-care in the third-line setting per treatment guidelines, patients who are resistant or intolerant to two or more TKIs are at a high risk of progression<sup>2</sup><sup>-5,</sup><sup>19-21</sup>.

In the ASCEMBL trial, 233 patients were randomized to receive asciminib 40 mg twice daily (n=157) or Bosulif 500 mg once a day (n=76)<sup>1</sup>. Data showed that, at 24 weeks, more patients achieved a CCyR in the asciminib arm (40.8%) than in the Bosulif arm (24.2%); and deep molecular response (DMR) rates were higher for patients in the asciminib arm than in the Bosulif arm – with 10.8% and 8.9% patients achieving MR<sup>4</sup> and MR<sup>4.5 </sup>on asciminib, respectively, vs. 5.3% and 1.3% on Bosulif<sup>1</sup>.

Grade =3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 50.6% and 60.5% of patients treated with asciminib and Bosulif, respectively<sup>1</sup>. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs in the asciminib arm was 5.8% compared to 21.1% for patients taking Bosulif <sup>1</sup>. Similarly, AEs requiring dose interruption and/or dose adjustments were reported less frequently with asciminib than with Bosulif (37.8% vs. 60.5%, respectively)<sup>1</sup>. At data cutoff, more patients were still on treatment in the asciminib arm vs. the Bosulif arm (61.8% vs. 30.3%, respectively)<sup>1</sup>.

The most common grade =3 AEs (occurring in &gt;10%) of patients treated with asciminib were thrombocytopenia (17.3%) and neutropenia (14.7%), while for Bosulif they were increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (14.5%), neutropenia (11.8%) and diarrhea (10.5%)<sup>1</sup>. On-treatment deaths on the asciminib arm occurred in two (1.3%) patients (ischemic stroke and arterial embolism); there was one (1.3%) death on Bosulif (septic shock)<sup>1</sup>. The most frequent AEs (all grades; =20%) were thrombocytopenia (28.8%) and neutropenia (21.8%) in the asciminib arm, compared to diarrhea (71.1%), nausea (46.1%), increased ALT (27.6%), vomiting (26.3%), rash (23.7%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (21.1%), neutropenia (21.1%) and thrombocytopenia (18.4%) in the Bosulif arm<sup>1</sup>.

“Though some patients with CML may be told they have a ‘good cancer’ because of the wonderful advances in care that have been made over the years, this doesn’t capture the full picture for everyone with the disease,” said Greg Stephens, Executive Director and Founder of the US National CML Society. “The results of the ASCEMBL study are very encouraging to the CML community, and help underscore the crucial need for additional treatment options to address real challenges that patients face.”

Pre-clinical data suggests that asciminib has specificity for BCR-ABL<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>. Additional data accepted for online publication highlight that, as an investigational STAMP inhibitor, asciminib is designed to help overcome mutations on the ATP-binding site of BCR-ABL1, which may help address resistance in later treatment lines of CML and may potentially address off-target activity<sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup>.

“Novartis has been at the forefront of CML research for years – significantly changing the prognosis for patients. We are very proud to once again advance a potentially transformative medicine, a novel STAMP inhibitor, for those who do not adequately respond or are intolerant to currently available TKIs,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “There is a clear need in later lines of therapy, and based on these results, we believe asciminib may become an important new development for patients. We look forward to sharing the data with regulatory authorities and moving forward with submissions worldwide.”

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for asciminib. Submission to the US and EU health authorities is planned for the first half of 2021.

<strong>About </strong><strong>asciminib</strong><strong> (</strong><strong>ABL</strong><strong>001)</strong>
Asciminib (ABL001) is an investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP). As a STAMP inhibitor, asciminib may help address tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistance and intolerance in later treatment lines of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and it is being studied in several clinical trials in hopes of helping patients across multiple treatment lines of CML<sup>23-30</sup>.

<strong>About </strong><strong>ASCEMBL</strong>
ASCEMBL is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized study comparing the oral investigational treatment asciminib (ABL001) versus bosutinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs)<sup>1</sup>. Patients with failure or intolerance to the most recently administered TKI therapy were included in the trial<sup>1</sup>.

Results of an interim analysis of the Phase III programme conducted by Oxford University with AZD1222, peer-reviewed and published in <i><a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/lancet/article/s0140-6736(20)32661-1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""link-confirmation noopener noreferrer"">The Lancet</a></i> today, demonstrated that the vaccine is safe and effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and that it protects against severe disease and hospitalisation. The interim analysis for efficacy was based on 11,636 participants accruing 131 symptomatic infections from the Phase III UK and Brazil trials conducted by Oxford University.

As announced on 23 November 2020, the primary efficacy endpoint of the programme statistical plan, based on the pooling of two dosing regimens, showed that the vaccine is 70.4% (95.8% CI: 54.8% to 80.6%) effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 occurring more than 14 days after receiving two doses of the vaccine. A secondary efficacy endpoint of prevention of severe disease demonstrated no cases of severe infections or hospitalisations in the vaccine group.

A further analysis of the efficacy regimens showed that when the vaccine was given as two full doses, vaccine efficacy was 62.1% (n=8,895; CI 41.0% to 75.7%), and 90.0% (n=2,741; CI 67.4% to 97.0%) in participants who received a half dose followed by a full dose.

Vaccine efficacy was also assessed on the secondary endpoint of early prevention of severe disease after the first dose. There were no hospitalisations or severe cases of COVID-19 more than 21 days after the first dose of the vaccine. Ten participants in the control group were hospitalised due to COVID-19, among whom two were assessed as severe, including one fatal case.

More data will continue to accumulate as part of the upcoming primary analysis and further follow-up, refining the efficacy reading and characterising vaccine efficacy over a longer period of time.

The safety data published so far is from over 20,000 participants enrolled across four clinical trials in the UK (COV001 and COV002), Brazil (COV003) and, in addition, from South Africa (COV005). <i>The Lancet</i> publication confirmed that AZD1222 was well tolerated and that there were no serious safety events confirmed related to the vaccine. The participants were from diverse racial and geographic groups who are healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions. This analysis provides safety data on 74,341 person-months of follow-up after first dose (median 3.4 months) and 29,060 person-months of follow-up after two doses (median 2.0). The overall reported rates of serious adverse events were 0.7% in the vaccine group and 0.8% in the control group.

Professor Andrew Pollard, Director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and Chief Investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said: “Today, we have published the interim analysis of the Phase III trial and show that this new vaccine has a good safety record and efficacy against the coronavirus. We are hugely grateful to our trial volunteers for working with us over the past eight months to bring us to this milestone.”

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “Today’s peer-reviewed publication enables a full disclosure of the Oxford programme interim analysis. The results show that the vaccine is effective against COVID-19, with in particular no severe infections and no hospitalisations in the vaccine group, as well as safe and well tolerated. We have begun submitting data to regulatory authorities around the world for early approval and our global supply chains are up and running, ready to quickly begin delivering hundreds of millions of doses on a global scale at no profit.”

Submission of the data to regulatory authorities around the world has already begun, as part of their ongoing rolling reviews of the vaccine data for temporary use or conditional approval during this health crisis. The Company is also seeking Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization for an accelerated pathway to vaccine availability in low-income countries.

In addition to the Oxford led programme, AstraZeneca is conducting a large study in the US and globally. In total, Oxford University and AstraZeneca expect to enrol more than 60,000 participants globally.

The Company is also making rapid progress in manufacturing with a capacity of up to 3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 on a rolling basis, pending regulatory approval. The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius/ 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered within existing healthcare settings.

AstraZeneca continues to engage with governments, multilateral organisations and collaborators around the world to ensure broad and equitable access to the vaccine at no profit for the duration of the pandemic.

<span class=""xn-location"">DUBLIN</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 8, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced the U.S. commercial launch of the Carpediem™ Cardio-Renal Pediatric Dialysis Emergency Machine. Following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) marketing authorization, granted earlier this year, the first Carpediem™ systems in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> were successfully installed and are in use at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The first of its kind Carpediem™ system is indicated for use in acute kidney injury or fluid overloaded patients requiring hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy. It is intended to provide continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to patients weighing between 2.5 and 10 kilograms.
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

Critically ill patients are at a high risk for fluid overload and acute kidney injury, conditions in which the kidneys do not function properly in their vital role of filtering waste products and excess fluid from the blood to produce urine. Fluid overload is common in critically ill neonates and children, particularly after procedures such as cardiac surgery. The mortality rate for neonates with acute kidney injury has been reported to be as high as 60 percent.[1]

</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

""CRRT procedures performed for critically ill infants using previously available technology are not optimal largely because dialysis machines available in the U.S. are not designed to treat these small, fragile patients, and can potentially expose them to many risks,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Stuart L. Goldstein</span>, M.D., professor of pediatrics and director, Center for Acute Care Nephrology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, who has been instrumental in raising awareness of the critical need for safe pediatric-specific dialysis. ""This new system is designed specifically for these patients which enables increased precision of neonatal CRRT treatment and, potentially, reduces these risks. We are grateful to be the first site in the U.S. with this technology to help the children in our care.""

CRRT is the most common treatment for critically ill patients whose kidneys are not functioning properly. In this form of renal replacement therapy, the patient's blood is pumped through a hemofilter to gently remove waste and excess fluid while minimizing the risk for hypotension (low blood pressure) and cardiac stability.

Pediatric patients requiring CRRT have historically been treated with systems designed and indicated for adults and not approved for pediatric use, which can create potential clinical complications for neonatal patients. The Carpediem™ system is intended to address many of the challenges associated with current machines because it is the first CRRT system designed specifically for patients weighing between 2.5 and 10 kilograms. This system was championed by Professor <span class=""xn-person"">Claudio Ronco</span>, Director, Department of Nephrology and International Renal Research Institute of the San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, <span class=""xn-location"">Italy</span> (IRRIV).

""At Medtronic, we strive to provide a portfolio of renal care solutions that improve outcomes, access to care, and quality of life for patients affected by severe renal injury or disease globally — no matter their size or age,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Ven Manda</span>, president, Renal Care Solutions, which is reported as part of the Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. ""For the first time, some of the tiniest and most vulnerable patients can be treated with technology designed specifically for them. We cannot make the world a healthier place alone. That is why collaboration with clinical experts, such as Prof. Ronco and Dr. Goldstein, is critical to bringing new treatment options to underserved populations.""

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Dec. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for its investigational KRASG12C inhibitor, sotorasib, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation, as determined by an FDA-approved test, following at least one prior systemic therapy.

“For more than 40 years, scientists have been trying to target KRAS. Today’s news is a welcome update for the many non-small cell lung cancer patients with the KRAS G12C mutation, who currently have no targeted therapies,” said Bonnie J. Addario, cofounder and board chair of the GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer. “We are pleased that the FDA and Amgen recognize the unmet need for these patients and are working to make new treatment options available as quickly as possible.”

KRAS G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC.1,2  In the U.S., about 13% of patients with NSCLC adenocarcinoma harbor the KRAS G12C mutation3 and each year approximately 25,000 new patients in the U.S. are diagnosed with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC.4  Unmet need remains high and options are limited for NSCLC patients with the KRAS G12C mutation that have failed first-line treatment. The outcomes with current therapies are suboptimal with response rates of approximately 9-18% and a median progression-free survival of approximately 4 months for second-line NSCLC.5,6,7

Amgen has taken on one of the toughest challenges of the last 40 years in cancer research8 by developing sotorasib. Sotorasib was the first KRASG12C inhibitor to enter the clinic and is being studied in the broadest clinical program exploring 10 combinations with global sites spanning across 4 continents. In just over two years, the sotorasib clinical program has also established the deepest clinical data set with more than 600 patients studied across 13 tumor types.

“Breakthrough Therapy designation and Real-Time Oncology Review bring Amgen closer to potentially providing a targeted therapy to patients with a KRAS G12C mutation and establishing sotorasib as the foundational therapy in KRAS G12C-driven cancers,” said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “We are pleased to receive these regulatory designations and plan to submit a new drug application by end of year as we rapidly work to get sotorasib to the patients who need it.”

A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of medicines that may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.9 The Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible.10

The designation and RTOR are supported by positive Phase 2 results in patients with advanced NSCLC from the CodeBreaK 100 clinical study, whose cancer had progressed despite prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. In the study, treatment with sotorasib provided durable anticancer activity with a positive benefit-risk profile.11 

About CodeBreaK
The CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen’s investigational drug sotorasib is designed to treat patients with an advanced solid tumor with the KRAS G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers. As the most advanced KRAS G12C clinical development program, CodeBreaK has enrolled more than 600 patients across 13 tumor types since its inception.

CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors. Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The Phase 2 trial in NSCLC enrolled 126 patients, 123 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline. The Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer (CRC) is fully enrolled and topline results are expected in 2021.

A global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC (CodeBreaK 200) is currently recruiting. Amgen also has several Phase 1b combination studies across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration or potential collaboration in pursuit of therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 (including statements regarding such collaboration’s, or our own, ability to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 or antibodies against targets other than the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, and/or to produce any such antibodies to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19), or the Otezla® (apremilast) acquisition (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

Basel, 08 December 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that new data on its investigational T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, mosunetuzumab, glofitamab and cevostamab, were presented at the all-virtual 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, from 5-8 December 2020, showing encouraging activity across multiple types of blood cancer. These antibodies work by binding to two different targets, on two different cells, simultaneously: one on the surface of cancer cells and one on the surface of immune cells called T-cells. This dual targeting approach activates a patient’s existing T-cells to engage and eliminate target cancer cells, offering an innovative approach for the treatment of blood cancers including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM); diseases where treatment options are currently limited, and resistance to, or relapse following, treatment is common. These bispecifics are just one of the novel ‘off-the-shelf’ technologies Roche is exploring, in its quest to improve patient outcomes.

“The data suggest that our novel bispecific antibodies have potential across multiple types of blood cancers, and supports broad exploration of these new immunotherapy approaches across different patient populations and treatment lines,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Lymphoma and multiple myeloma are challenging cancers to treat, especially when patients present with aggressive subtypes or experience multiple relapses, but ‘off-the-shelf’ therapies like these could provide new options that may potentially enable patients to be treated quickly.”

<strong>Promising responses with mosunetuzumab and glofitamab in non-Hodgkin lymphoma
</strong>To date in clinical trials, Roche’s two CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, mosunetuzumab and glofitamab, have shown promising responses across multiple types of NHL, including relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This is reinforced by the latest results from the phase I/Ib GO29781 study in R/R FL, which show that 51.6% of patients (n=32/62) achieved a complete response (CR) when treated with mosunetuzumab.[1] High response rates also continue to be seen with glofitamab. For example, new data from the phase I/Ib NP30179 study in R/R NHL show a CR rate of 53.6% in aggressive NHL (n=15/28).[2] Additionally, both bispecific antibodies have proven to have manageable safety profiles. One of the most common adverse events (AEs) observed with bispecific antibodies is cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which involves the over activation of immune cells, and is a known risk associated with immunotherapies that activate the body’s own immune system. [3] Based on studies so far, CRS events with mosunetuzumab and glofitamab are largely low-grade (mainly Grade 1-2), occur in early treatment cycles, and are mostly reversible.[1,2]

Beyond the R/R setting, mosunetuzumab and glofitamab are also being investigated in earlier treatment lines, including first-line DLBCL. Initial data with single-agent mosunetuzumab in the phase I/II GO40554 study, show a CR rate of 45.5% (n=10/22) in elderly or unfit patients who are unable to tolerate full-dose immunochemotherapy. Additionally, when mosunetuzumab was combined with chemotherapy in the phase Ib/II GO40515 study, the CR rate was 79.4% (n=27/34). These are the first bispecific antibody studies in 1L DLBCL to report data, and while early, these results support the potential for mosunetuzumab to provide a new, much-needed treatment option for these patients.[4,5]

Robust development programmes are ongoing for mosunetuzumab and glofitamab, investigating the treatments as monotherapies and in combination with other molecules, as well as more convenient forms of administration such as subcutaneous administration, with several phase III trials planned in the near future.

<strong>Encouraging activity with cevostamab in heavily pre-treated patients with multiple myeloma
</strong>The third of Roche’s bispecific antibodies in malignant haematology, and latest addition to its pipeline, is cevostamab, a first-of-its kind FcRH5xCD3 bispecific antibody targeting FcRH5 on myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells. FcRH5 is a unique and differentiated target and is expressed on nearly 100% of myeloma cells. Cevostamab is currently being investigated in the ongoing phase I GO39775 dose-escalation and expansion study in heavily pre-treated patients with MM (with a median of six prior lines of therapy); a population for whom new treatment options are urgently needed.

First clinical safety and efficacy data presented at ASH, showed an encouraging overall response rate of 53% (n=18/34) at active doses. Notably, responses were seen in high-risk patients, including those refractory to five different classes of drug (penta-drug refractory) and those with prior exposure to anti-BCMA therapy. Safety of cevostamab was manageable with the most common treatment-related AE being CRS (76%). The majority of CRS events were Grade 1–2 (Grade 1; 34% and Grade 2; 40%) and occurred in cycle 1. One patient experienced Grade 3 CRS (2%) and no Grade 4 or 5 CRS events were observed.[6] Additional biomarker analyses presented at the congress are also helping to further understand the potential of cevostamab in MM and inform its future development, including strategies to mitigate the risk of CRS.[7]

Roche is excited about the ongoing development of its three bispecific antibodies in malignant haematology and eager to understand their full potential in patients with blood cancers.

<strong>About Roche’s CD20xCD3 bispecific antibodies</strong>
Roche is currently developing two T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, mosunetuzumab and glofitamab, designed to target CD20 on the surface of B-cells and CD3 on the surface of T-cells. This dual targeting activates and re-directs a patient’s existing T-cells to engage and eliminate target B-cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins into the B-cells. Mosunetuzumab and glofitamab differ in their structures, and both are being developed by Roche as part of our ongoing haematology research and development strategy to explore multiple bispecific formats, to identify those that may maximise clinical benefits for patients. Mosunetuzumab has a structure similar to that of a natural human antibody in that it has two ‘Fab’ regions, but is different from naturally-occurring antibodies in that one ‘Fab’ region targets CD20 and the other ‘Fab’ region targets CD3. Glofitamab is based on a novel structural format which we call ‘2:1’, which refers to the structure of the antibody. It is engineered to have two ‘Fab’ regions which bind to CD20, and one ‘Fab’ region which binds to CD3. The clinical development programmes for mosunetuzumab and glofitamab include ongoing investigations of these molecules as monotherapies and in combination with other medicines, for the treatment of people with CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, and other blood cancers.

<strong>About cevostamab (FcRH5xCD3 bispecific antibody)
</strong>Cevostamab (BFCR4350A) is an FcRH5xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody designed to target FcRH5 on myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells. FcRH5 is a unique and differentiated target, expressed on nearly 100% of myeloma cells.[8] Cevostamab has a structure similar to that of a natural human antibody in that it has two ‘Fab’ regions, but is different from naturally-occurring antibodies in that one ‘Fab’ region targets FcRH5 and the other ‘Fab’ region targets CD3. This dual targeting activates and re-directs a patient’s existing T-cells to engage and eliminate target FcRH5-expressing myeloma cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins into the myeloma cells.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Tirzepatide led to superior A1C and body weight reductions from baseline in adults with type 2 diabetes after 40 weeks of treatment in topline results from Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) SURPASS-1 monotherapy clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared to placebo. Using the efficacy estimandi, the highest dose of tirzepatide led to an A1C reduction of 2.07 percent and reduced body weight by 9.5 kg (11.0 percent). More than half (51.7 percent) of participants in this arm achieved an A1C less than 5.7 percent – the level seen in people without diabetes.

The overall safety profile of tirzepatide was similar to the well-established GLP-1 receptor agonist class, with gastrointestinal side effects being the most commonly reported adverse events. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were less than 7 percent in each tirzepatide treatment arm.

Tirzepatide is a novel investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single molecule, representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The primary and key secondary endpoints of SURPASS-1, the first phase 3 trial of the comprehensive SURPASS program, included superior A1C and mean body weight reductions compared to placebo. Study participants, 54.2 percent of whom were treatment-naïve, had a relatively short mean duration of diabetes of 4.7 years, a baseline A1C of 7.9 percent and a baseline weight of 85.9 kg.

“Tirzepatide delivered impressive A1C and weight reductions for people with type 2 diabetes in this trial, confirming and building upon the phase 2 data that were released in 2018,” said Julio Rosenstock, M.D., Director of the Dallas Diabetes Research Center and Principal Investigator of SURPASS-1. “The study took a bold approach in assessing A1C targets. Not only did nearly 90 percent of all participants taking tirzepatide meet the standard A1C goal of less than 7 percent, more than half taking the highest dose also achieved an A1C less than 5.7 percent, the level seen in people without diabetes – an unprecedented finding and unique endpoint in trials evaluating glucose-lowering agents.”

Treatment differences for two estimands – efficacy and treatment-regimenii – were evaluated for the three tirzepatide doses (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) compared to placebo. Across both estimands, all three tirzepatide doses reached statistical significance in A1C and body weight reductions from baseline and in the percentage of participants who achieved an A1C of less than 7 percent (the American Diabetes Association’s recommended target for people with diabetes) or less than 5.7 percent.

Weight reduction: -6.3 kg (5 mg), -7.0 kg (10 mg), -7.8 kg (15 mg), -1.0 kg (placebo)
Percentage of participants achieving A1C <7%: 81.8% (5 mg), 84.5% (10 mg), 78.3% (15 mg), 23.0% (placebo)
Percentage of participants achieving A1C <5.7%: 30.9% (5 mg), 26.8% (10 mg), 38.4% (15 mg), 1.4% (placebo)
No events of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia less than 54 mg/dL were observed in the tirzepatide treatment arms.

The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and mild to moderate in severity, usually occurring during the dose escalation period. For study participants treated with tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively), nausea (11.6 percent, 13.2 percent, 18.2 percent), diarrhea (11.6 percent, 14.0 percent, 11.6 percent), vomiting (3.3 percent, 2.5 percent, 5.8 percent) and constipation (5.8 percent, 5.0 percent, 6.6 percent) were more frequently experienced compared to placebo (6.1 percent [nausea], 7.8 percent [diarrhea], 1.7 percent [vomiting], 0.9 percent [constipation]). The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 9.1 percent (5 mg), 9.9 percent (10 mg), 21.5 percent (15 mg) and 14.8 percent (placebo). The majority of the discontinuations in the 15 mg and placebo arms were due to reasons other than adverse events (such as concerns due to the coronavirus pandemic and family or work reasons).

“As a leader in diabetes care, we have a nearly 100-year heritage of innovating to advance care for people living with diabetes. Tirzepatide is the first dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist to complete a phase 3 trial,” said Mike Mason, president, Lilly Diabetes. “We are impressed by these initial results showing how tirzepatide performed in people with a relatively short duration of diabetes, and we look forward to seeing more results in people who are later in the course of diabetes in future studies from our robust SURPASS clinical trial program.”

The complete SURPASS-1 study data have not yet been evaluated but will be presented at the American Diabetes Association’s® 81st Scientific Sessions® and published in a peer-reviewed publication in 2021.

About tirzepatide
Tirzepatide is a once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single novel molecule. GIP is a hormone that may complement the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists. In preclinical models, GIP has been shown to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure therefore resulting in weight reductions, and when combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, may result in greater effects on glucose and body weight. Tirzepatide is in phase 3 development for blood glucose management in adults with type 2 diabetes and for chronic weight management. It is also being studied as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

About SURPASS-1 and the SURPASS clinical trial program
SURPASS-1 (NCT03954834) is a 40-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg as monotherapy to placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone. The trial randomized 478 study participants across the U.S., Mexico, India and Japan in 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg or placebo. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg) is superior in A1C reduction from baseline after 40 weeks in people with type 2 diabetes naïve to injectable therapy who haven’t used any oral antidiabetic medicines within three months compared to placebo. Study participants had a mean A1C between 7 percent and 9.5 percent and a BMI greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2. All participants in the tirzepatide treatment arms started the study at a dose of tirzepatide 2.5 mg once-weekly and then increased the dose in a step-wise approach at four-week intervals to their final randomized maintenance dose of 5 mg (via a 2.5 mg step), 10 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 7.5 mg) or 15 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg and 12.5 mg).

The SURPASS phase 3 global clinical development program for tirzepatide has enrolled more than 10,000 people with type 2 diabetes across eight clinical trials, five of which are global registration studies. The program began in late 2018 with results anticipated in late 2020 and 2021.

About Diabetes
Approximately 34 million Americans1 (just over 1 in 10) and an estimated 463 million adults worldwide2 have diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type internationally, accounting for an estimated 90 to 95 percent of all diabetes cases in the United States alone1. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body does not properly produce or use the hormone insulin.

Basel, 9 December 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced a partnership with Moderna Inc. to utilise the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody test in Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine research trials. This will facilitate the quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and help to establish a correlation between vaccine-induced protection and levels of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies. Significantly, Moderna’s vaccine triggers antibody response specifically to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This follows the recent announcement that Roche has received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody test.

“Roche values the collaboration with Moderna, which has already included the successful use of our qualitative Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test, targeting the nucleocapsid protein, in an earlier part of the studies”, said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “We are pleased to see that our quantitative Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 S test, which targets the spike protein, is now also being used as part of the Moderna vaccine trials, which could ultimately help to end this pandemic.”

Measuring the quantitative levels of anti-RBD SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using Roche’s test will help Moderna to gain valuable insights into the correlation between protection from vaccination and antibody levels. This could play a role in assessing if, or when, an individual needs revaccination, or in helping to answer other clinically relevant questions.

To enhance our understanding of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 there would be a benefit in knowing the starting levels of antibodies a person has, prior to vaccination, in order to evaluate any change in antibody levels that the vaccine induces. This is particularly relevant in the case of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, since these antibodies have been shown to have potent antiviral activity and correlate to potential immunity.<sup>1</sup> Measuring antibody levels can also play a role in establishing vaccine efficacy in the prevention of infection and/or the development of severe COVID-19.<sup>2</sup>

This partnership with Moderna, started by using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test for qualitative determination of anti-N SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This has been part of Moderna’s vaccine trials for baselining and assessing natural infection in trial participants.

<strong>About potential SARS-COV-2 vaccines</strong>
Candidate vaccines, such as Moderna’s mRNA-1237, aim to induce an antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Any potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 would work (amongst other mechanisms) by triggering the immune response to develop neutralising antibodies in the person receiving the vaccine. In doing so, the vaccine trains the body’s immune system to recognise and fight an exposure to SARS-CoV-2, in a controlled way, without being exposed to the actual virus.<sup>2</sup>

<strong>About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test</strong>
Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S is an immunoassay for the quantitative, in vitro determination of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma. Through a blood sample, the test can measure the quantity of antibodies to the spike protein of the coronavirus. Specifically, the test targets antibodies which are directed against the particular region of the viral spike protein responsible for binding to the host cell receptor, which is required for the virus to enter the host cell.

The presence and level of such antibodies could signal whether a person has been already infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus.

This plays an important part in characterising a vaccine-induced immune response.<sup>2</sup> The majority of current candidate vaccines aim to induce an antibody response against the spike protein.

<strong>About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test</strong>
Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the qualitative, in vitro detection of antibodies (including IgG) to SARS-CoV-2. The test can detect antibodies to the coronavirus, which could signal whether a person has been already infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. This test can also help in the determination of seroprevalence (i.e. the frequency of individuals with antibody to the virus), in a given population, as well as a complement test to Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Hospitals and reference laboratories can run both the tests on Roche’s cobas e analysers which are widely available around the world. These fully-automated systems can provide SARS-CoV-2 test results in approximately 18 minutes, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyser.<sup>3</sup>

<strong>About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>

<em>Our research into therapies:</em>
Roche is committed to improving the treatment of COVID-19. We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are exploring the potential of our investigational molecules.

In August we signed a collaboration agreement with Regeneron on developing and manufacturing and significantly increasing global supply of an investigational antibody combination for COVID-19 if it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted. We are also partnering with Atea to jointly develop AT-527, an orally administered direct-acting antiviral (DAA) currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. If approved, Atea will distribute AT-527 in the United States and Roche will be responsible for global manufacturing and distribution outside the United States.

At the beginning of the pandemic, on 19 March on 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA -  a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. On 29 July we announced that COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia or the key secondary endpoint of reduced mortality.

Separately, we have studied Actemra©/RoActemra© in the EMPACTA study in COVID-19 associated hospitalised pneumonia in patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials. On 18 September we announced that the phase III EMPACTA study showed Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care reduced the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. However, there was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra/RoActemra or placebo.

Actemra©/RoActemra© is also being studied in combination with the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the REMDACTA trial in partnership with Gilead, announced 28 May. Actemra©/RoActemra© is not approved by any health authority for use in COVID-19 pneumonia. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

<span class=""xn-location"">EAST HANOVER, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 9, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Novartis today announced updated median overall survival (OS) results for Kisqali<sup>®</sup> (ribociclib) in combination with endocrine therapy, marking the longest survival data ever reported in premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. The Phase III MONALEESA-7 trial evaluated Kisqali plus endocrine therapy (goserelin plus either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen) as initial treatment compared to endocrine therapy alone in pre- and perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. These updated median OS data will be presented today at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Virtual Symposium.

After a median of 53.5 months follow-up, median OS for patients taking Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy was 58.7 months vs. 48.0 months for endocrine therapy alone (HR=0.76 [95% CI: 0.61-0.96])<sup>1</sup>. Additionally, a similar median OS benefit of 58.7 months was observed with Kisqali plus an aromatase inhibitor subgroup vs. 47.7 months in the placebo plus aromatase inhibitor subgroup (HR=0.80 [95% CI, 0.62-1.04]), and the survival benefit shown in subgroup analyses was consistent with the intent-to-treat (ITT) population<sup>1</sup>. This exploratory ad hoc analysis follows the previously reported MONALEESA-7 OS analysis presented at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, which demonstrated statistically significant OS results for Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy. After a median of 42 months follow-up, the estimated survival rate was 70.2% [95% CI: 63.5 to 76.0] for women who received Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy compared to 46.0% [95% CI, 32.0 to 58.9] for women who received endocrine therapy alone (HR=0.71 [95% CI: 0.54 to 0.95]) p=0.00973)<sup>4</sup>.

""These longer-term data showing ribociclib can help women with metastatic breast cancer live longer are remarkable and emphasize the progress we've made in treating this disease, which until now, had an estimated median survival of just three years,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Debu Tripathy</span>, M.D., chair of Breast Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center. ""I'm hopeful the proven overall survival benefit with ribociclib will shift the standard for those with metastatic breast cancer, and that patients are empowered to ask their doctors about which treatments give them the best chance of living longer with the best quality of life.""

The need for chemotherapy was delayed by more than four years (50.9 months) in patients taking Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy (HR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.56-0.87)<sup>1</sup>. No new adverse events were observed. Kisqali is not indicated for use with tamoxifen.

""We're proud to be able to provide the CDK4/6 inhibitor with the longest ever reported median overall survival benefit of nearly five years in younger women,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Susanne Schaffert</span>, Ph.D., President, <span class=""xn-person"">Novartis Oncology</span>. ""It is our vision to develop therapies that give patients the longest life possible, and these best-in-class data help us realize that vision by proving Kisqali extends the lives of younger premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, who typically have more aggressive disease and unique needs.""

Metastatic breast cancer in premenopausal women is biologically distinct, more aggressive and the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59 years old<sup>2,3</sup>.

<b>About Kisqali<sup>®</sup> (ribociclib)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Kisqali was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2017</span> and by the European Commission (EC) in <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2017</span>, as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial. Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor was approved for the treatment of pre-, peri- or postmenopausal women as initial endocrine based therapy, and also indicated for use in combination with fulvestrant as both first- or second-line therapy in postmenopausal women by the FDA in <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2018</span> and by the EC in <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2018</span>. Regulatory filings are underway with other health authorities worldwide.

Kisqali was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals.

<b>Approved Uses</b><br class=""dnr"" />KISQALI<sup>®</sup> (ribociclib) is a prescription medicine used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of pre/perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as initial endocrine-based therapy; or fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as initial endocrine-based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy. It is not known if Kisqali is safe and effective in children or adolescents.

<b>Important Safety Information<br class=""dnr"" /></b>KISQALI may cause severe or life-threatening inflammation of the lungs during treatment that may lead to death. Patients should contact their doctor right away if they have trouble breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain, cough with or without mucus. Severe skin reactions skin reactions have been reported with Kisqali. Patients should get medical help right away if they have a severe rash or rash that keeps getting worse.

Kisqali can cause a heart problem known as QT prolongation. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and may lead to death. Kisqali is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen due to an increased risk of QT prolongation. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have a change in their heartbeat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if they feel dizzy or faint. Kisqali can cause serious liver problems. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they get any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark or brown (tea-colored) urine, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, pain on the upper right side of the stomach area (abdomen), and bleeding or bruising more easily than normal.

Low white blood cell counts are very common when taking Kisqali and may result in infections that may be severe. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have signs and symptoms of low white blood cell counts or infections such as fever and chills. Before taking Kisqali, patients should tell their health care provider if they are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant as Kisqali can harm an unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant and who take Kisqali should use highly effective birth control during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Do not breastfeed during treatment with Kisqali and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Patients should tell their health care provider about all of the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements since they may interact with Kisqali. Patients should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking Kisqali.

The most common side effects (incidence &gt;=20%) include infections, white blood cell count decreases, headache, cough, nausea, tiredness, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, hair loss and rash. The most common Grade 3/4 side effects (incidence &gt;5%) were infections, low neutrophils, low leukocytes, low red blood cells, abnormal liver function tests, low lymphocytes, low phosphate levels and vomiting. Abnormalities were observed in hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory tests.

COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of research in providing information about disease and treatments. However, it’s challenging for researchers to recruit enough volunteers so that studies are representative of the general population. To make it easier for leading research institutions to connect with potential study participants, we’re introducing the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.health.research.studies"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" data-analytics-onclick=""{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.health.research.studies&quot;}"">Google Health Studies app</a> with the first study focused on respiratory illness.

With the new app, anyone with an Android phone can take part in health studies by answering survey questions and contributing relevant data. The app provides a platform for researchers to reach a large and diverse population so they can better understand human health, while providing the public with greater opportunities to contribute to medical research.
<h3>Keeping participant data private, safe and secure</h3>
In building the app we focused on three principles: keeping information safe, treating it responsibly, and putting participants in control. When participants use the Google Health Studies app, their data is protected with Google’s advanced security. All information is encrypted and research data is stored securely.

We also give participants transparency and control over their personal information. For each study, participants can clearly see what data is being contributed, and when and why it’s shared. To protect participants’ personal information we adhere to strict privacy policies. Study data will only be used for the purposes that are explicitly consented to in the research study and will not be sold, shared with advertisers, or be used to show participants ads. The Google Health Studies app also makes it easy for participants to understand their contributions to each study, as well as access research findings when they become available.
<h3>Studying respiratory illnesses</h3>
We’ve partnered with researchers from Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital for the first study, which will help scientists and public health communities better understand respiratory illnesses, including influenza and COVID-19.

This Respiratory Health Study will be open to adults in the U.S., and will focus on identifying how these types of illnesses evolve in communities and differ across risk factors such as age, and activities such as travel. Study participants will use the Google Health Studies app to regularly self-report how they feel, what symptoms they may be experiencing, any preventative measures they’ve taken, and additional information such as COVID-19 or influenza test results. By taking part in this study, volunteers can represent their community in medical research, and contribute to global efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

""With COVID-19 emerging alongside seasonal respiratory pathogens, research is now needed more than ever to develop more effective treatments and mitigation strategies,” says Dr. John Brownstein, professor at Harvard Medical School and Chief Innovation Officer of Boston Children’s Hospital. “Google Health Studies provides people with a secure and easy way to take part in medical research, while letting researchers discover novel epidemiological insights into respiratory diseases.”

In collaboration with Google Research, this first study utilizes <a href=""https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/federated-analytics-collaborative-data.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" data-analytics-onclick=""{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/federated-analytics-collaborative-data.html&quot;}"">federated learning and analytics</a>—a privacy technology that keeps a person’s data stored on the device, while allowing researchers to discover aggregate insights based on encrypted, combined updates from many devices. This means researchers in this study can examine trends to understand the link between mobility (such as the number of daily trips a person makes outside the home) and the spread of COVID-19, This same approach <a href=""https://support.google.com/gboard/answer/9334583?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" data-analytics-onclick=""{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://support.google.com/gboard/answer/9334583?hl=en&quot;}"">powers typing predictions on Gboard</a>, without Google seeing what individuals type.

<strong>Ingelheim, Germany and Basel, Switzerland – 10 December 2020</strong> – Boehringer Ingelheim today announced the signing of a binding agreement for acquiring all shares of NBE-Therapeutics, a private, clinical-stage Swiss biotechnology company focused on antibody-drug conjugates and advancing targeted cancer therapies derived from its immune stimulatory iADC<sup class=""footnote"">™</sup> platform.  NBE-Therapeutics’ lead compound NBE-002 is currently in phase I clinical studies for triple negative breast cancer and other solid tumors.  Importantly, Boehringer Ingelheim gains access to an innovative and unique platform that it will use to build a leading ADC portfolio and develop potential combinations with other assets from its cancer immunology portfolio.

“NBE-Therapeutics’ iADC platform adds exceptional tumor targeting capabilities to our oncology portfolio. Together with our immune cell-targeting assets, this could enable new powerful combinations that will allow for efficacious and durable treatments for patients,” said Michel Pairet, member of Boehringer Ingelheim’s Board of Managing Directors with responsibility for the company’s Innovation Unit. “This acquisition is a further example of Boehringer Ingelheim’s long-term strategy to enhance our position as an innovator of novel cancer therapies for patients in need. We welcome NBE-Therapeutics’ richly talented team to Boehringer Ingelheim and we look forward to collaborating with them on this important work.”

The total transaction value is 1.18 billion euros and also includes contingent clinical and regulatory milestones.

“I am extremely proud of the NBE-Therapeutics’ team and delighted that our world class ADC expertise is being recognized by Boehringer Ingelheim.  This transaction is a validation of our platform and its potential for the next generation cancer therapies,” said Bertrand Damour, Chief Executive Officer of NBE-Therapeutics. “We look forward to progressing NBE-002, our lead program and best-in-class anti ROR1 ADC, and to continuing the fight against cancer alongside Boehringer Ingelheim with its strong clinical development capabilities.”

Boehringer Ingelheim’s cancer cell directed research is focused on the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of difficult-to-treat solid tumors.  Inducing tumor cell death is a key component, and ADC based approaches have emerged as a powerful targeted therapy with potential for induction of immunogenic cell death at reduced systemic exposure and toxicity.

The NBE-Therapeutics’ acquisition will significantly strengthen Boehringer Ingelheim’s strategic focus on targeted cancer cell-directed therapies and complements existing capabilities in antigen discovery as well as antibody and T-cell engager technologies. By combining its world-class, in-house research and development with that of highly innovative biotechnology companies, Boehringer Ingelheim is developing innovative therapies and accelerating the delivery of the next generation of cancer treatments. This builds on recent strategic acquisitions and collaborations, including the acquisition of ViraTherapeutics and AMAL Therapeutics, which are also contributing assets.

NBE-Therapeutics is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, where it was founded with financial backing from a syndicate of both corporate and institutional investors, including the Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund, and PPF Group, as their largest shareholders, and Denmark’s Novo Holdings. NBE-Therapeutics’ technology platform and derived assets are protected by a broad portfolio of patents and licenses.

The consummation of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected during the course of Q1 2021.

<strong>About the ADC Platform</strong>
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC’s) are a class of drugs that consist of an antibody that specifically binds to a target on tumor cells.  The antibody is also linked to a cytotoxic drug to kill these cells. If the drug was given systemically, it would cause an unacceptable level of toxicity. However, due to the ability to now localize the drug to the tumor microenvironment using an antibody, the safety profile of the drug becomes acceptable.

NBE-Therapeutics’ proprietary technology platform creates highly potent immune stimulatory antibody-drug conjugates with an anthracycline payload, directly targeting tumor cells and inducing a long-lasting immunological anti-tumor effect.  Its technology also incorporates a proprietary enzymatic conjugation step allowing for the site-specific conjugation of small molecule drugs to monoclonal antibodies overcoming liabilities related to limited serum stability and heterogeneous linkage.

<strong>About NBE-002</strong>
NBE-Therapeutics’ lead candidate, NBE-002, is an anti-ROR1 ADC.  ROR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in various hematologic and solid malignancies, including triple negative breast cancers and lung adenocarcinoma.  The compound is currently in phase I clinical studies.

<strong>About NBE-Therapeutics                        </strong>
NBE-Therapeutics is a privately-owned Swiss biotech company based in Basel and founded in 2012 with the vision of developing next-generation immune-stimulatory antibody drug conjugate (iADC<sup class=""footnote"">™</sup>) products. NBE-Therapeutics advances its products to clinical proof of concept with the goal of improving treatment options for cancer patients.

FOSTER CITY, Calif. &amp; BAD HOMBURG, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and MYR GmbH, a German biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV), today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Gilead will acquire MYR for approximately €1.15 billion in cash, payable upon closing of the transaction plus a potential future milestone payment of up to €300 million (both payments subject to customary adjustments).
<p id=""news-body-cta"">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201210005315/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201210005315/en/</a></p>
The acquisition will provide Gilead with Hepcludex<sup>™</sup> (bulevirtide), which was conditionally approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of chronic HDV infection in adults with compensated liver disease in July 2020. MYR has since launched Hepcludex in France, Germany and Austria, and continues to prepare for launch in certain other markets throughout 2021. It is expected that this transaction will accelerate the global launch of Hepcludex. Hepcludex is a first-in-class treatment for HDV that blocks viral entry into liver cells through binding to NTCP. It is the first and currently the only medicine conditionally approved for HDV by the EMA, and MYR anticipates submission for accelerated approval in the United States in the second half of 2021. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the medicine both Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designations for chronic HDV infection.

HDV is the most severe form of viral hepatitis and can have mortality rates as high as 50% within 5 years in cirrhotic patients. HDV occurs only as a co-infection in individuals who have hepatitis B virus (HBV). At least 12 million people worldwide are likely currently co-infected with HDV and HBV. HDV co-infection leads to more serious liver disease than HBV alone and is associated with a faster progression to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and an increased risk of liver cancer and death. In the United States and Europe, there are collectively more than 230,000 people living with HDV, which remains underdiagnosed globally.

“HDV is a devastating disease with high unmet medical need. With Hepcludex we have the opportunity to address that need with a first-in-class therapy,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. “We look forward to working with the team at MYR to realize the full potential of Hepcludex for patients with HDV worldwide. This will build on the work that Gilead has been doing for almost two decades to innovate and improve therapies for viral hepatitis.”

“We are proud of our achievement in bringing Hepcludex from preclinical stage to patients in need within such a short timeframe,” said Dmitry Popov, Chief Executive Officer, MYR GmbH. “We are excited to join Gilead, whose experience in the hepatitis field and global infrastructure will realize the full potential of Hepcludex and provide access to as many patients as possible around the world with this debilitating disease.”

Hepcludex (bulevirtide) is an entry inhibitor that binds to NTCP, an essential HBV and HDV receptor on hepatocytes, blocking the ability of HDV to enter hepatocytes. Bulevirtide has been tested in more than 500 patients in completed and ongoing clinical studies. The benefit of bulevirtide has been demonstrated by an effective reduction of HDV RNA levels and improvement of liver inflammation. In the MYR202 study, which was a controlled, open-label Phase 2 study, 54 of 90 patients treated with bulevirtide plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) had at least a 2 log<sub>10</sub> HDV RNA decline or undetectable HDV RNA at week 24 versus 1 of 28 patients given TDF alone. Almost half of patients treated with bulevirtide and TDF also showed a normalization in the blood levels of the liver enzyme ALT, indicating an improvement of liver disease, as compared to 7% of patients who received TDF alone.

In the Phase 2 MYR203 study evaluating a 48-week treatment course of bulevirtide, a further 15 patients were treated with Hepcludex 2mg daily monotherapy for 48 weeks. In this limited dataset, the safety and efficacy profiles were similar to patients treated for 24 weeks in combination with TDF in the MYR202 study. Interim 24-week data from the ongoing Phase 3 study MYR301 of bulevirtide is anticipated in the first half of 2021 and is expected to serve as the basis for filing in the United States.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Terms of the Agreement</span></b>

Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, Gilead will acquire MYR for approximately €1.15 billion in cash, payable upon closing of the transaction plus a potential future milestone payment of up to €300 million upon U.S. FDA approval (both payments subject to customary adjustments). After the closing, in addition to enhancing Gilead’s revenue growth, the acquisition of MYR is expected to be neutral to non-GAAP EPS in the first two years after close and moderately accretive thereafter. Closing of the transaction is subject to expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and receipt of merger control approvals in certain European jurisdictions.

Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC is acting as financial advisor to Gilead. UBS Europe SE is acting as financial advisor to MYR. Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, Mayer Brown LLP, and Flick Gocke Schaumburg are serving as legal counsel to Gilead and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer Rechtsanwälte Steuerberater PartG mbB is serving as legal counsel to MYR.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Hepcludex (bulevirtide)</span></b>

Hepcludexis the first drug conditionally approved for the treatment of HDV in adults with compensated liver disease in Europe. Hepcludex blocks the NTCP receptor on the surface of hepatocytes and prevents the entry of HBV/HDV into hepatocytes and viral spread within the liver. Hepcludex is administered subcutaneously as monotherapy or in patients being treated with a nucleoside/nucleotide analogue. Hepcludexhas received Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of HDV infection from EMA and from the FDA. Hepcludex has been granted PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme eligibility by EMA for the treatment of HDV infection and Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. Bulevirtide is an investigational agent in the U.S. and outside of the European Economic Area; in these regions the safety and efficacy have not been established.

The most commonly reported serious adverse reaction was an exacerbation of hepatitis after treatment discontinuation, and most commonly reported adverse reactions were an increase in bile salts and injection site reactions. The safety and efficacy of Hepcludex in patients with decompensated cirrhosis have not been established and therefore its use is not recommended.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and TOKYO, Dec. 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Eisai, Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) announced that Biogen has submitted a Japanese New Drug Application (J-NDA) to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for aducanumab, an investigational therapy for Alzheimer’s disease. Aducanumab, an amyloid beta-targeting antibody, has been shown in clinical trials to remove amyloid beta in the brain and significantly slow clinical decline in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia.

“Japan is the third market where we have applied for regulatory approval for aducanumab, and the filing represents continued progress on our commitment to bring this therapy to patients around the world,” said Michel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen. “Japan has met the challenges of a rapidly aging population by demonstrating global leadership in setting policies that aim to increase support for Alzheimer’s disease patients and caregivers. We look forward to the regulatory review of aducanumab with the hope that, if approved, it could help further manage the impact of this devastating disease.”

“As Japan has the oldest population in the world, it is anticipated that the social burden of Alzheimer’s disease will continue to grow,” said Dr. Haruo Naito, Chief Executive Officer at Eisai Co., Ltd. “For more than 30 years, Eisai has been dedicated to dementia research and development, and working with people living with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers to fight this disease. The filing of the application is an important step in serving patients and their families as aducanumab may help reduce clinical decline and potentially maintain the ability to live an independent life for as long as possible. Aducanumab also has the potential to help address the public health challenges our aging population faces in Japan.”

The Japanese regulatory authority will review the application through the standard review process. In addition to the filing in Japan, aducanumab is under Priority Review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of March 7, 2021 and is also under review with the European Medicines Agency.

<strong>About Aducanumab</strong>
Aducanumab (BIIB037) is an investigational human monoclonal antibody studied for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Based on clinical data from patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease, aducanumab has the potential to impact underlying disease pathophysiology, slow cognitive and functional decline and provide benefits on patients’ ability to perform activities of daily living, including conducting personal finances, performing household chores, such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry, and independently traveling out of the home. If approved, aducanumab would be the first treatment to meaningfully change the course of the disease for individuals living with Alzheimer’s.

Biogen licensed aducanumab from Neurimmune under a collaborative development and license agreement. Since October 2017 Biogen and Eisai Co., Ltd. have collaborated on the development and commercialization of aducanumab globally.

EMERGE and ENGAGE were Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab. The primary objective of the studies was to evaluate the efficacy of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared with placebo in reducing cognitive and functional impairment as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared to placebo on clinical decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 Items (ADAS-Cog 13) and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory Mild Cognitive Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-MCI).

<strong>About Alzheimer’s Disease</strong>
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that impairs thinking, memory and independence, leading to premature death. The disease currently cannot be stopped, delayed or prevented and is a growing global health crisis, affecting those living with the disease and their families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tens of millions of people worldwide live with Alzheimer’s disease, and the number will grow in the years ahead, outpacing the healthcare resources needed to manage it and costing billions of dollars.

According to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry, it is estimated approximately 4.6 million people live with dementia and about 4 million people live with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in Japan (2012). Alzheimer’s disease is suspected to represent around 60-70% of dementia cases.

Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by changes in the brain, including the abnormal accumulation of toxic amyloid beta plaque, which begins approximately 20 years before patients exhibit symptoms of the disease. MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease is one of the earliest stages of the disease when symptoms start to be more visible and can be detected and diagnosed. Current research efforts are focused on catching and treating patients as early as possible for the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

Basel, 10 December 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today presented an exploratory analysis from the Phase III IMvigor010 study evaluating Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), compared with observation, as an adjuvant (after surgery) monotherapy treatment for people with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer (MIUC) at the European Society for Medical Oncology Immuno-Oncology (ESMO IO) Virtual Congress, 9–12 December 2020.

Data from IMvigor010 show that in people with circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), a benefit in disease-free survival (DFS) was seen in those receiving Tecentriq when compared with observation (median 5.9 months versus median 4.4 months, hazard ratio [HR]=0.58; 95% CI: 0.43–0.79). Overall survival (OS) at an interim analysis also favoured treatment with Tecentriq in the ctDNA-positive population, with a median of 25.8 months with Tecentriq, compared with 15.8 months for observation (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.41–0.86). Although these pre-specified analyses are exploratory and could not be formally tested per the statistical plan in the IMvigor010 study, the data further our understanding of the disease and will inform a new Phase III study in people with ctDNA-positive muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

“Bladder cancer is a complex and often difficult disease to treat, but as we continue to understand its biology, we are gaining greater clarity around new therapeutic avenues,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “By using ctDNA and other biomarkers, we hope to gain insights that enable a more personalised approach to treatment. We are applying these findings to our clinical development programme.”

As presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 (ASCO20) Virtual Congress, IMvigor010 did not meet its primary endpoint of DFS compared with observation in people with high-risk MIUC in the intention-to-treat population (19.4 months with Tecentriq versus 16.6 months with observation [HR=0.89; 95% CI: 0.74–1.08; p=0.2446]). In an interim analysis of OS, the median was not reached in either treatment arm (HR=0.85). Safety data for Tecentriq were consistent with the known monotherapy safety profile, and no new safety concerns were identified.

The goal of current treatment in people with MIUC is to provide early intervention to reduce the risk of the disease recurring or spreading to other parts of the body. As tumours grow, dying cells are replaced by new ones, releasing tumour DNA into the bloodstream. This DNA, known as ctDNA, can be utilised in different ways, including identifying people with minimal residual disease who may benefit the most from adjuvant therapy as well as those for whom adjuvant therapy may not provide benefit. In MIUC, ctDNA is a strong prognostic marker of disease recurrence.<sup>1</sup> More treatment options following surgery are needed because approximately half of people with MIUC will develop a recurrence of their disease within 2 years of surgery,<sup>2</sup> and with no predictive or prognostic biomarkers used in current clinical practice for MIUC,<sup>1,3</sup> there is a need for more personalised treatments for this disease.<sup>1</sup>

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

These data were presented at the ESMO IO Virtual Congress in the Proffered paper oral session on 10 December 2020, 13:50-14:02 CET.

<strong>About the IMvigor010 study</strong>
IMvigor010 is a global Phase III, open-label, randomised, controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant treatment with Tecentriq compared with observation in 809 people with MIUC, who are at high risk of recurrence following resection. The primary endpoint is DFS as assessed by investigator, which is defined as the time from randomisation to invasive urothelial cancer recurrence or death.

Key efficacy results from the exploratory analysis are below:

<strong>About bladder cancer and muscle-invasive urothelial cancer</strong>
In 2018, there were over half a million new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed globally, with approximately 200,000 deaths from the disease.<sup>4</sup> Urothelial cancer is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for about 90–95% of all cases.<sup>5</sup> MIUC is a type of urothelial cancer that has spread into the muscle of the bladder, ureter or renal pelvis.<sup>6</sup> Approximately 25% of new cases of bladder cancer are diagnosed with muscle-invasive disease,<sup>7</sup> which is associated with a poorer prognosis than non-MIUC.<sup>6</sup>

Roche will run a new Phase III study in people with ctDNA-positive muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

<strong>About Tecentriq</strong>
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and for hepatocellular carcinoma. In the US, Tecentriq is also approved in combination with Cotellic® (cobimetinib) and Zelboraf® (vemurafenib) for the treatment of people with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

<strong>About Roche in cancer immunotherap</strong>y
Roche’s rigorous pursuit of groundbreaking science has contributed to major therapeutic and diagnostic advances in oncology over the last 50 years, and today, realising the full potential of cancer immunotherapy is a major area of focus. With over 20 molecules in development, Roche is investigating the potential benefits of immunotherapy alone, and in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapies or other immunotherapies with the goal of providing each person with a treatment tailored to harness their own unique immune system to attack their cancer. Our scientific expertise, coupled with innovative pipeline and extensive partnerships, gives us the confidence to continue pursuing the vision of finding a cure for cancer by ensuring the right treatment for the right patient at the right time.

In addition to Roche’s approved PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), Roche’s broad cancer immunotherapy pipeline includes other checkpoint inhibitors, such as tiragolumab, a novel cancer immunotherapy designed to bind to TIGIT, individualised neoantigen therapies and T-cell bispecific antibodies.

Basel, 11 December 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that it has launched a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 antigen test as an aid in the diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, in markets accepting the CE Mark. Roche has also filed for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The Elecsys® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is a highly accurate laboratory immunoassay for the in vitro qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid antigen of SARS-CoV-2. In clinical studies, the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test showed a 94.5% sensitivity across 200 PCR confirmed symptomatic individuals* and a 99.9% specificity across 2747 PCR negative symptomatic and screening individuals. It is planned to ramp up production to have a double-digit million number of tests per month, in early 2021, depending on the demand of healthcare systems, globally. The test is performed by healthcare professionals and uses nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples from patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, or people with either known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2. A widely available, laboratory-based automated antigen assay allows for cost and error reduction due to removal of manual handling as well as fast turn-around times and high test throughput.

“Healthcare systems remain under significant pressure to deliver robust testing options, with a sufficient number of tests available”, said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “The launch of our high-throughput antigen test will provide additional testing capacity to reliably support healthcare systems in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection, as a supplement to PCR testing.”

<strong>About the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test</strong>
Roche’s Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is an immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 present in the respiratory tract including nasopharynx and oropharynx. The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is performed by healthcare professionals and could be used as an alternative or in conjunction with PCR testing. This is highly beneficial where reliable laboratory PCR testing is limited or not available. A positive result with the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test, In symptomatic individuals, a positive result with the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test,  indicates an active SARS-CoV-2 infection with a likelihood of 94.5%. A negative result may require to be confirmed with a PCR test or repeated (antigen test) after one to two days, if other clinical indications point to a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen immunoassay runs on all cobas e immunochemistry analysers which are widely available around the world and allow for these test to be run alongside other COVID-19 infectious diseases diagnostic markers available from Roche, which run on the cobas e systems. These fully automated systems can provide test results in 18 minutes for a single test (excluding time for sample collection, transport, and preparation), with a throughput of up to 300 tests per hour from a single analyser, depending on the analyser.<sup>1</sup>

<strong>About antigen testing</strong>
An antigen test detects proteins which are structural or functional components of a pathogen and are thus very specific to that pathogen.<sup>2</sup> In this case, the test would provide a qualitative “yes/no” answer on the presence of the pathogen in the patient sample. If the target antigen is present in sufficient concentrations in the sample, it will bind to specific antibodies and generate a positive result, indicating an active infection.<sup>3</sup>

In general, antigen tests have a high specificity, though are not as sensitive as PCR tests that amplify the target viral DNA or RNA sequence in order to generate a quantifiable signal to indicate the presence of the virus in a sample. Therefore, to make up for the potential decrease in sensitivity of an antigen test, negative results should be analysed together with additional patient factors, such as COVID-19 exposure history, clinical symptoms, additional test results to help guide the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of the patient.

<strong>About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>
As a leading healthcare company we are doing all we can to support countries in minimising the impact of COVID-19.  We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help to detect and diagnose  the infection in patients, as well as providing digital support to healthcare systems, and we continue to identify, develop and support potential therapies which can play a role in treating the disease.

We understand the impact of COVID-19 goes beyond those who contract it, which is why we are working with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need during these challenging times. As we learn from the pandemic, we are partnering with governments and others to make healthcare stronger and more sustainable in the future.

<em>Our diagnostics solutions:</em>
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. Our portfolio includes:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, (FDA Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) and available in countries accepting the CE Mark)</li>
 	<li>a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-based antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood targeting the nucleocapsid (FDA EUA and CE Mark)</li>
 	<li>an IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19  (FDA EUA and CE Mark)</li>
 	<li>Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic</li>
 	<li>a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test to help determine at the point of care whether a person has been exposed to the virus (CE Mark)</li>
 	<li>a rapid antigen test to support in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care within 15 minutes (CE Mark)</li>
 	<li>a high-volume molecular test to simultaneously detect and differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B, as the symptoms are similar for both (FDA EUA and CE Mark)</li>
 	<li>a second SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, aimed at measuring the spike protein to support vaccination development and complement our existing portfolio</li>
 	<li>a point-of-care molecular PCR test that simultaneously detects and differentiates between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B infections to support urgent triage and diagnosis (FDA EUA and CE Mark)</li>
</ul>
<em>Our research into therapies:</em>
Roche is committed to improving the treatment of COVID-19. We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are exploring the potential of our investigational molecules.

In August we signed a collaboration agreement with Regeneron on developing and manufacturing and significantly increasing global supply of an investigational antibody combination for COVID-19 if it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted. We are also partnering with Atea to jointly develop AT-527, an orally administered direct-acting antiviral (DAA) currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. If approved, Atea will distribute AT-527 in the United States and Roche will be responsible for global manufacturing and distribution outside the United States.

At the beginning of the pandemic, on 19 March on 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA -  a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. On 29 July we announced that COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia or the key secondary endpoint of reduced mortality.

Separately, we have studied Actemra©/RoActemra© in the EMPACTA study in COVID-19 associated hospitalised pneumonia in patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials. On 18 September we announced that the phase III EMPACTA study showed Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care reduced the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. However, there was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra/RoActemra or placebo.

Actemra©/RoActemra© is also being studied in combination with the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the REMDACTA trial in partnership with Gilead, announced 28 May. Actemra©/RoActemra© is not approved by any health authority for use in COVID-19 pneumonia. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

TOKYO, December 10, 2020 -- Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 4519) announced today that it concluded a license agreement with Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) for the development and commercialization in Japan for the antibody cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab (formerly known as REGN-COV2) for COVID-19.

The antibody cocktail combining two virus neutralizing antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, was created by Regeneron for the potential treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Roche and Regeneron are collaborating on developing and commercializing casirivimab and imdevimab. As part of the agreement,  Regeneron will distribute the treatment in the U.S. while Roche will be responsible for manufacturing and distribution outside the U.S. Under the license agreement between Chugai and Roche, Chugai obtained development and exclusive commercialization rights in Japan for casirivimab and imdevimab.

The casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail is currently being studied globally in a phase II/III clinical study for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization, a phase II/III clinical study for the treatment of non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and a phase III clinical study for prevention of infection in COVID-19 household contacts. A phase III open-label clinical study for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization is also ongoing in the U.K. (the ‘RECOVERY’ trial). In November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization for casirivimab and imdevimab for the treatment of certain high-risk, non-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

“We are pleased that Chugai can join forces with Roche and Regeneron to provide a potential treatment to fight COVID-19, a disease that has brought unprecedented harm to people’s health and lives as well as disruption to all areas of society,” said Chugai’s President and COO, Dr. Osamu Okuda. “We are committed to delivering the product to people in Japan as soon as possible.”

<strong><b>About </b><b>casirivimab and imdevimab</b></strong>

Casirivimab and imdevimab were designed specifically by Regeneron scientists to block the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. They evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company's proprietary <i>VelocImmune</i><sup>®</sup> mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies identified from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies administered together, bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus's spike protein, which may help diminish the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population<sup>1</sup>.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","CAMBRIDGE, England & BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–AstraZeneca and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) have entered into a definitive agreement for AstraZeneca to acquire Alexion.

Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares (ADSs) (each ADS representing one-half of one (1/2) ordinary share of AstraZeneca, as evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)) for each Alexion share. Based on AstraZeneca’s reference average ADR price of $54.14, this implies total consideration to Alexion shareholders of $39bn or $175 per share.

The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the acquisition. Subject to receipt of regulatory clearances and approval by shareholders of both companies, the acquisition is expected to close in Q3 2021, and upon completion, Alexion shareholders will own c.15% of the combined company.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “Alexion has established itself as a leader in complement biology, bringing life-changing benefits to patients with rare diseases. This acquisition allows us to enhance our presence in immunology. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues at Alexion so that we can together build on our combined expertise in immunology and precision medicines to drive innovation that delivers life-changing medicines for more patients.”

Ludwig Hantson, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, Alexion, said: “For nearly 30 years Alexion has worked to develop and deliver transformative medicines to patients around the world with rare and devastating diseases. I am incredibly proud of what our organisation has accomplished and am grateful to our employees for their contributions. This transaction marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Alexion. We bring to AstraZeneca a strong portfolio, innovative rare disease pipeline, a talented global workforce and strong manufacturing capabilities in biologics. We remain committed to continuing to serve the patients who rely on our medicines and firmly believe the combined organisation will be well positioned to accelerate innovation and deliver enhanced value for our shareholders, patients and the rare disease communities.”

Strategic rationale

Both companies share the same dedication to science and innovation to deliver life-changing medicines. The capabilities of both organisations will create a company with great strengths across a range of technology platforms, with the ability to bring innovative medicines to millions of people worldwide. The combined company will also have an enhanced global footprint and broad coverage across primary, speciality and highly specialised care.

Scientific leadership – accelerated presence in immunology

AstraZeneca has built a growing scientific presence in oncology, and in cardiovascular, renal and metabolism, and respiratory diseases, with a focus on organ protection. AstraZeneca has developed a broad range of technologies, initially focused on small molecules and biologics and with a growing focus in precision medicine, genomics, oligonucleotides and epigenetics. More recently, AstraZeneca has increased its efforts in immunology research and the development of medicines for immune-mediated diseases.

Alexion has pioneered complement inhibition for a broad spectrum of immune-mediated rare diseases caused by uncontrolled activation of the complement system, a vital part of the immune system. Alexion’s franchise includes Soliris (eculizumab), a first-in-class anti-complement component 5 (C5) monoclonal antibody. The medicine is approved in many countries for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome, generalized myasthenia gravis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. More recently, Alexion launched Ultomiris (ravulizumab), a second-generation C5 monoclonal antibody with a more convenient dosing regimen.

Alexion’s immunology expertise extends to other targets in the complement cascade beyond C5 as well as additional modalities, with its deep pipeline including Factor D small-molecule inhibitors of the alternative pathway of the complement system, an antibody blocking neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling, and a bi-specific mini-body targeting C5, among others. The FcRn extends the half-life and hence the availability of pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.

AstraZeneca, with Alexion’s R&D team, will work to build on Alexion’s pipeline of 11 molecules across more than 20 clinical-development programmes across the spectrum of indications, in rare diseases and beyond.

Alexion’s leading expertise in complement biology will accelerate AstraZeneca’s growing presence in immunology. The acquisition adds a new technology platform to AstraZeneca’s science and innovation-driven strategy. The complement cascade is pivotal to the innate immune system. It plays a crucial role in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases across multiple therapy areas, including haematology, nephrology, neurology, metabolic disorders, cardiology, ophthalmology and acute care. In contrast, AstraZeneca’s capabilities in genomics, precision medicine and oligonucleotides can be leveraged to develop medicines targeting less-frequent diseases. Combining AstraZeneca’s capabilities in precision medicine and Alexion’s expertise in rare-disease development and commercialisation will enable the new company to develop a portfolio of medicines addressing the large unmet needs of patients suffering from rare diseases.

The combined companies will bring together two rapidly converging, patient-centric models of care delivery with combined strengths in immunology, biologics, genomics and oligonucleotides to drive future medicine innovation. AstraZeneca intends to establish Boston, Massachusetts, US as its headquarters for rare diseases, capitalising on talent in the greater Boston area.

Industry-leading revenue growth; enhanced geographical presence and broad coverage across primary, specialised and highly specialised care

AstraZeneca’s acquisition of Alexion, with its strong commercial portfolio and robust pipeline, will support its long-term ambition to develop novel medicines in areas of immunology with high unmet medical needs. Alexion achieved impressive revenue growth over the last few years, with revenues of $5.0bn in 2019 (21% year-on-year growth). Alexion has exhibited skilful commercial execution in building its ‘blockbuster’ C5 franchise. The success of the franchise is demonstrated by the effective transition of over 70% of PNH patients from Soliris to Ultomiris in less than two years of launch in its key markets, including the US, Japan and Germany, as well as the strong pipeline of additional indications for Ultomiris.

Rare diseases is a high-growth therapy area with rapid innovation and significant unmet medical need. Over 7,000 rare diseases are known today, and only c.5% have US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments.1 The global rare disease market is forecasted to grow by a low double digit percentage in the future.2

AstraZeneca intends to build on its geographical footprint and extensive emerging markets presence to accelerate the worldwide expansion of Alexion’s portfolio.

The two companies have been on converging paths, AstraZeneca expanding its presence from primary to speciality care, whereas Alexion has been progressing from ultra-orphan to orphan and speciality conditions.

The acquisition strengthens AstraZeneca’s industry-leading growth, underpinned by its broad portfolio of medicines, which will enable the new company to bring innovative medicines to a broad range of healthcare practitioners in primary, speciality and highly specialised care.

The combined company is expected to deliver double-digit average annual revenue growth through 2025.

Financial benefits

Enhanced revenue growth, operating margin and cash-flow generation

The acquisition is expected to improve the combined Group’s profitability, with the core operating margin significantly enhanced in the short term, and with continued expansion thereafter. This uplift is supported by increased scale and expected recurring run-rate pre-tax synergies of c.$500m per year from the combined Group (by end of the third year following completion of the acquisition). AstraZeneca expects to generate significant value from the acquisition by extending Alexion’s commercial reach through leveraging AstraZeneca’s global presence and accelerating the development of Alexion’s pipeline.

The acquisition also strengthens AstraZeneca’s cash-flow generation, providing additional flexibility to reinvest in R&D and rapid debt reduction, with an ambition to increase the dividend.

Immediately earnings-accretive and value-enhancing acquisition, in line with stated capital-allocation priorities

The acquisition is expected to deliver robust and sustainable accretion to AstraZeneca’s core earnings per share (EPS) from the outset, with double-digit percentage accretion anticipated in the first three years following the completion of the acquisition.

The acquisition of Alexion is consistent with AstraZeneca’s capital-allocation priorities. The combined company is expected to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating, and the acquisition supports AstraZeneca’s progressive dividend policy. The combination represents a significant step in AstraZeneca’s strategic and financial-growth plans.

Details of the acquisition

Key terms

The acquisition will be undertaken through a US statutory merger in which Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 new AstraZeneca ADSs listed on the Nasdaq exchange for each of their Alexion shares. The cash and ADS consideration represents an c.45% premium to Alexion shareholders based on the closing stock price of Alexion on 11 December 2020 and a c.43% premium, based on the 30-day volume-weighted average closing stock price of $122.04 before this announcement. If they elect, Alexion shareholders may receive their allocation of AstraZeneca ADSs in the form of a corresponding number of ordinary shares of AstraZeneca in addition to the cash consideration.

Based on AstraZeneca’s reference average ADR price of $54.14, this implies total consideration to Alexion shareholders of $39bn or $175 per share.

Financing

To support the financing of the offer consideration, AstraZeneca has entered into a new committed $17.5bn bridge-financing facility, provided by Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Securities plc and Goldman Sachs. The bridge-financing facility is available for an initial term of 12 months from the earlier of the date of completion of the acquisition and 12 December 2021 with up to two six-month extensions available at the discretion of AstraZeneca. The initial bridge financing facility is intended to cover the financing of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration and associated acquisition costs and to refinance the existing term loan and revolving credit facilities of Alexion. In due course, AstraZeneca intends to refinance the initial bridge-financing facility through a combination of new medium-term bank loan facilities, debt-capital market issuances and business cash flows.

The acquisition is expected to significantly enhance cash generation, which will support rapid debt reduction and overall deleveraging. AstraZeneca remains committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating. The dividend policy remains unchanged with a commitment to a progressive dividend policy; dividend cover is expected to be materially enhanced as a result of the acquisition.

Further information on synergies

The acquisition is expected to realise recurring run-rate pre-tax synergies of c.$500m per year from the combined Group, generated from commercial and manufacturing efficiencies as well as savings in central costs, with full run-rate expected to be achieved by end of the third year following completion of the acquisition.

To realise the total synergies, AstraZeneca expects to incur one-time cash costs of c.$650m, during the first three years following completion.

Management and employees

Members of Alexion’s current senior management team will lead the future rare-disease activities. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, AstraZeneca has agreed that for 12 months following closing, it will provide the Alexion employees with the same level of salary as such employees had before closing, incentive compensation opportunities that are in the aggregate no less favourable than those provided before closing and substantially comparable benefits to those provided before closing.

Governance

The companies will mutually agree on two individuals from the Alexion board of directors who will join the AstraZeneca board as directors upon closing of the acquisition.

Closing conditions

Closing of the acquisition is subject to approval by AstraZeneca and Alexion shareholders, certain regulatory approvals, approval of the new AstraZeneca shares for listing with the Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange, and other customary closing conditions.

The acquisition is a Class 1 transaction for AstraZeneca and as such, will require the approval of its shareholders to comply with the UK Listing Rules. A shareholder circular, together with notice of the relevant shareholder meeting, will be distributed to shareholders in the first half of 2021. The Alexion proxy statement is also expected to be published in the first half of 2021.

Subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the proposed acquisition, the companies expect the acquisition to close in Q3 2021.

Termination

The acquisition terms provide that Alexion will be liable to pay a break fee of up to $1.2bn to AstraZeneca in certain specified circumstances (including a change of Alexion’s board recommendation or completion of an alternative acquisition). AstraZeneca will also be required to pay Alexion a break fee of $1.4bn in certain specified circumstances, including a change of AstraZeneca’s board recommendation.

NEW YORK &amp; MAINZ, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the emergency use of the mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2, against COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age or older. The vaccine is now authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) while Pfizer and BioNTech gather additional data and prepare to file a planned Biologics License Application (BLA) with the FDA for a possible full regulatory approval in 2021.

Under Operation Warp Speed, the Department of Defense (DoD) in partnership with agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will manage allocation and distribution of the vaccine in the U.S. This will be prioritized according to the populations identified by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines.

""Pfizer's purpose is breakthroughs that change patients’ lives, and in our 171-year history there has never been a more urgent need for a breakthrough than today with hundreds of thousands of people continuing to suffer from COVID-19,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “As a U.S. company, today's news brings great pride and tremendous joy that Pfizer has risen to the challenge to develop a vaccine that has the potential to help bring an end to this devastating pandemic. We have worked tirelessly to make the impossible possible, steadfast in our belief that science will win.”

“We founded BioNTech to develop new technologies and medicines that utilize the full potential of the immune system to fight serious diseases,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “Today we are another step closer to our vision. We believe that today’s Emergency Use Authorization, and the subsequent distribution of our vaccine that has demonstrated an efficacy rate of 95% and a favorable safety profile, will help to save lives across the United States and could accelerate a return to normality.”

The FDA based its decision on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the companies, including data from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine&amp;esheet=52347443&amp;newsitemid=20201211005640&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=3&amp;md5=f5eb276489f58c229191f37b9b879978"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">announced</a> last month and published this week in <i><a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2034577%3Fquery%3Dfeatured_home&amp;esheet=52347443&amp;newsitemid=20201211005640&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=The+New+England+Journal+of+Medicine&amp;index=4&amp;md5=c2e861b8aa30300c3467912f2f28052d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">The New England Journal of Medicine</a></i>. The Phase 3 data demonstrated a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and also in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from 7 days after the second dose. The Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. All trial participants will continue to be monitored to assess long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose.

Pfizer and BioNTech appreciate the continued participation of the approximately 44,000 trial volunteers and remain committed to the companies’ pledge to always make their safety and well-being the companies’ top priority. The participants in our COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial are courageous volunteers who have made a personal and important choice to help make a difference during this pandemic. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to provide an option for trial participants who received the placebo to receive the vaccine at scheduled timepoints in the study. This vaccine transition option will be voluntary and will be implemented in alignment with the regulatory authorities where the trial is conducted.

In July 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpfizer-and-biontech-announce-agreement-us-government-600&amp;esheet=52347443&amp;newsitemid=20201211005640&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=5&amp;md5=a60cce132f39e33a2546097151eb056e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">announced</a> an agreement with the HHS and the DoD to meet the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program goal to deliver doses of a vaccine for COVID-19. With the vaccine being authorized for emergency use in the U.S., the companies will begin delivering the first doses in the U.S. immediately, with delivery fulfillment expected to be completed in 2021.

<b>About the Phase 2/3 Study</b>

The ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2, which is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, has enrolled more than 44,000 participants, the vast majority of whom have received their second dose. A breakdown of the diversity of clinical trial participants can be found <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fscience%2Fcoronavirus%2Fvaccine&amp;esheet=52347443&amp;newsitemid=20201211005640&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=7&amp;md5=8d0e4537a06467410da88efbeba7f78b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">here</a> from more than 150 clinical trial sites in the U.S., Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina.

The Phase 3 trial is designed as a 1:1 vaccine candidate to placebo, randomized, observer-blinded study to obtain safety, immune response, and efficacy data needed for regulatory review. The trial’s primary endpoints are prevention of COVID-19 in those who have not been infected by SARS-CoV-2 prior to immunization, and prevention of COVID-19 regardless of whether participants have previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Secondary endpoints include prevention of severe COVID-19 in those groups. The study also will explore prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Data from this study, including longer term safety, comprehensive information on duration of protection, efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and safety and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age will be gathered in the months ahead. Additional studies are planned to evaluate BNT162b2 in pregnant women, children younger than 12 years, and those in special risk groups, such as the immunocompromised.

<b>Manufacturing and Delivery Capabilities</b>

Pfizer and BioNTech continue to work in collaboration with governments and Ministries of Health around the world that will distribute the vaccine, subject to country authorization or approval and terms of supply agreements, to help ensure it can reach those most in need as quickly as possible. The companies are leveraging Pfizer’s leading vaccine manufacturing and distribution capabilities to quickly scale, manufacture and distribute large quantities of the vaccine at high quality, complementing BioNTech’s mRNA manufacturing expertise gained over almost a decade. Pfizer has a 171-year track record of researching, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative medicines and vaccines to patients in need. Pfizer and BioNTech are confident in their ability to deliver the vaccine to people in the U.S. Based on current projections, Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s combined manufacturing network has the potential to supply globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021 (subject to manufacturing capacity and regulatory approval or authorization).

Pfizer is leveraging three of its U.S. manufacturing sites to produce the COVID-19 vaccine – Saint Louis, Missouri, Andover, Massachusetts, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. Pfizer’s Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin and Puurs, Belgium sites are also being used.

Pfizer has vast experience and expertise in cold-chain shipping and has an established infrastructure to supply the vaccine worldwide, including distribution hubs that can store vaccine doses for up to six months. The company’s distribution is built on a flexible just-in-time system that can ship the frozen vials quickly to designated points of vaccination at the time of need, minimizing the need for long term storage. Vaccination in a pandemic situation is expected to be rapid, and we do not expect that the product will need to be stored at any location for more than 30 days. To assure product quality, the companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers for the vaccine, which can maintain recommended storage conditions (-70°C ±10°C) for extended periods of time with dry ice. The shipper can maintain temperature for 10 days unopened which allows for transportation to markets globally. Once open, a vaccination center may use the specially designed shippers as a temporary storage solution to maintain the recommended storage conditions (-70°C ±10°C) up to 30 days with re-icing every five days in accordance with the handling instructions. Each shipper contains a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of each vaccine shipment 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored safely for up to five days at refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions.

From the start of the research program earlier this year, Pfizer and BioNTech have successfully supplied and distributed their investigational vaccine to more than 150 clinical trial sites across the U.S., as well as Europe, Latin America and South Africa reaching approximately 44,000 participants. Based on their collective experience, the companies believe in their capability to distribute the vaccine globally upon approval or authorization. BioNTech will hold the regulatory approvals in the U.S., U.K., Canada and, if authorized, in the EU, and other countries. Pfizer will have marketing and distribution rights worldwide with the exception of China, Germany, and Turkey.
