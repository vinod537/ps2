TOKYO & BASKING RIDGE, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) has been granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants ODD to medicines intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases of disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.

An estimated 27,600 new cases of gastric cancer will be diagnosed this year, and the disease could lead to more than 11,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2020.1

The phase 2 DESTINY-Gastric01 trial demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) for patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal cancer treated with ENHERTU, a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC), versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy (irinotecan or paclitaxel monotherapy).

The overall safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY-Gastric01 was consistent with that seen in the phase 1 gastric cancer trial in which the most common adverse events (≥30%, any grade) were hematologic and gastrointestinal including neutrophil count decrease, anemia, nausea and decreased appetite. There were cases of drug-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, the majority of which were grade 1 and 2 with two grade 3 and one grade 4. No ILD-related deaths (grade 5) occurred in patients with gastric cancer in the phase 1 trial or in the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial.

The research results of DESTINY-Gastric01 will be presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program.

Earlier this month, ENHERTU received two Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the FDA for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab, and for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.

ENHERTU also received SAKIGAKE designation in March 2018 from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for potential use in HER2 positive gastric cancer, and a supplemental New Drug Application was recently submitted to the Japan MHLW.

About HER2

HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. In some tumors, HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as HER2 amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.1

About Gastric Cancer

Gastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer mortality; there were approximately one million new cases reported in 2018 and 783,000 deaths.2 In the U.S., it is estimated that 27,600 new cases of stomach cancer will be diagnosed in 2020 and more than 11,000 people will die from the disease.1

Approximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.3 Gastric cancer is usually diagnosed in the advanced stage in the U.S., but even when diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest.4 Recommended first-line treatment for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve outcomes when added to chemotherapy.5 For gastric cancer that progresses on first-line treatment, trastuzumab has not shown any further benefit and there are no other approved HER2 targeted medicines.6

DESTINY-Gastric01

DESTINY-Gastric01 is a phase 2, open-label, multi-center trial assessing the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in a primary cohort of 188 patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2 expressing advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) who have progressed on two or more prior treatment regimens including fluoropyrimidine (5-FU), platinum chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy). Patients were treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study is ORR as assessed by an independent review committee. Secondary endpoints include OS, progression-free survival, duration of response, disease control rate and time to treatment failure as well as pharmacokinetic and safety endpoints.

About ENHERTU

ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan outside the U.S.) is a HER2 directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC Scientific platform.

ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.

ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial.

ENHERTU has been approved for use only in the U.S. and Japan. ENHERTU has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the United States, for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for the subject proposed use.

About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program

A comprehensive development program for ENHERTU is underway globally with six pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.

About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca

In March 2019, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for the manufacturing and supply.

U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU

ENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.
Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.
Contraindications

None.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis

Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).

Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).

Neutropenia

Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.

Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.

Left Ventricular Dysfunction

Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.

Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.

Adverse Reactions

The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.

ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.

The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

Use in Specific Populations

Pregnancy: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.
Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.
Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.
Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%).
Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

33540,Top 20 Medical Device Companies Based on 2019 Revenue,Bayer submits larotrectinib for marketing authorization in Japan for the treatment of TRK fusion cancer,"The MAA is submission is based on P-I trial of adult patients, P-II NAVIGATE study in adult and adolescent patients and the P-I/II pediatric SCOUT study. These trials evaluate larotrectinib in 20+ histologies of solid tumors including lung, thyroid, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, colon, cholangiocarcinoma, soft tissue sarcomas, salivary gland and infantile fibrosarcoma
 The therapy is already approved in multiple countries including the US, Brazil, Canada and countries of EU, under the brand name Vitrakvi while the filings in other region are in progress
 Larotrectinib is an oral TRK inhibitor, intended to treat adults and children with LA/ m-solid tumors with NTRK gene fusion. Following the acquisition of Loxo by Eli Lilly and Company in Feb’ 2019, Bayer has obtained the exclusive licensing rights for larotrectinib and the selitrectinib (BAY 2731954) which is under clinical development","Berlin, May 22, 2020 – Bayer has submitted an application for marketing authorization for its precision oncology treatment larotrectinib to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan. Larotrectinib is an oral TRK inhibitor that has been developed specifically to treat adults and children with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have the rare genomic alteration called a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion. The product is already approved in several countries under the brand name Vitrakvi™, including the U.S., Brazil, Canada and countries of the European Union (EU). Filings in other regions are underway or planned.

“With this submission, we are one step closer to providing patients and physicians in Japan with a highly selective treatment exclusively designed for adults and children with TRK fusion cancer, that has the potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes regardless of tumor type or patient age,” said Scott Z. Fields, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology Development at Bayer’s Pharmaceutical Division. “While cancers have previously been treated mainly in the body, larotrectinib was developed specifically to treat patients with TRK fusion cancer, regardless of where in the body the tumor originates. Larotrectinib represents an important advancement in the fight against this rare cancer, as it could replace costly treatment that is not targeted specifically to this cancer and does not have proven efficacy and safety in this patient population.”

The submission to the MHLW is based on clinical trial data from the Phase I trial of adult patients, the Phase II NAVIGATE trial in adult and adolescent patients and the Phase I/II pediatric SCOUT trial. In these trials, larotrectinib was investigated across more than 20 different histologies of solid tumors including lung, thyroid, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, colon, cholangiocarcinoma, soft tissue sarcomas, salivary gland and infantile fibrosarcoma.

TRK fusion cancer is rare overall. It affects both children and adults and occurs in varying frequencies across various tumor types. TRK fusion cancer occurs when an NTRK gene fuses with another unrelated gene, producing an altered TRK protein. The altered protein, or TRK fusion protein, becomes constitutively active or overexpressed, triggering the activation of an intercellular signaling cascade. These TRK fusion proteins act as oncogenic drivers that fuel the spread and growth of the patients’ cancer, regardless of where it originates in the body.

About larotrectinib
Larotrectinib, a specific oral TRK inhibitor, was exclusively designed to treat tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion. The compound has demonstrated high response rates and durable responses with a favorable safety profile over three years in adults and children with TRK fusion cancer, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors. It has the largest dataset and longest follow-up data of any TRK inhibitor. The trials are still ongoing, with the latest dataset published in The Lancet Oncology and additional updates planned to be presented at upcoming scientific meetings.

Larotrectinib was approved in September 2019 in the European Union under the brand name Vitrakvi™ for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors that display an NTRK gene fusion, who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and who have no satisfactory treatment options. Vitrakvi has also received regulatory approval in additional markets, including the U.S, Brazil and Canada. Filings in other regions are underway or planned.

Following the acquisition of Loxo Oncology by Eli Lilly and Company in February 2019, Bayer has obtained the exclusive licensing rights for the global development and commercialization, including in the U.S., for larotrectinib and the investigational another TRK inhibitor selitrectinib (BAY 2731954) progressing through clinical development.

 Following the US FDA’s approval, CDSCO can approve the therapy by waiving off clinical trials in special circumstances in accordance with the provisions of the New Drug and Clinical Trial Rules 2019
 Remdesivir is one of the four treatments that are being evaluated WHO’s solidarity trial to find an effective treatment for COVID-19 across multiple countries. Additionally, Gilead has entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with pharma firms including Cipla, Jubilant Life Sciences and Hetero for manufacture and distribution of remdesivir","US pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences may soon apply to India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) seeking marketing authorisation for its anti-viral drug remdesivir — being considered as a potential medication for COVID-19.

Officials of the Union Health Ministry, along with the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) held a discussion with the representatives of Gilead Sciences on Wednesday to prepare a road map for introducing remdesivir in India.

The US-based company was apprised about the regulatory procedures for granting of approval to a new drug in the country and was assured of total facilitation.

The company representatives said they will get back after discussion with their board of directors,” an official said.

The medicine has been issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hospitalised COVID-19 patients.

Regulatory approval under exceptional pathway was granted by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on May 7, on the basis of clinical data from the US.

The efficacy of remdesivir was discussed in a recent meeting of the joint-monitoring group (technical committee) headed by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and the use of the drug on COVID-19 patients was not approved due to lack of enough scientific evidence at that stage.

he Indian Council of Medical Research had earlier said anti-viral medication remdesivir which was used during Ebola outbreak may inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication and research on its efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 is a part of the WHO’s ‘solidarity trial.’

Tweet this

PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated its Marketing Authorization Applications (MAA) for both idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121) and CC-486. Validation of each application confirms the respective submissions are complete and begins the EMA’s centralized review process.

The MAA for ide-cel, the company’s investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy co-developed with bluebird bio, Inc., is for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody. Ide-cel was granted Accelerated Assessment status by the EMA in March, reducing the maximum timeframe for review of the application to 150 days.

“Europe has one of the highest incidence rates of multiple myeloma, and patients who have relapsed and are refractory to standard treatment regimens are in need of treatment options to improve outcomes,1” said Stanley Frankel, M.D., senior vice president, Cellular Therapy Development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We will continue to work with the EMA to bring ide-cel to patients in the European Union who are battling this aggressive blood cancer.”

The MAA for CC-486 is for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), following induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment, and who are not candidates for, or who choose not to proceed to, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

“For patients with AML, maintaining remission remains an extremely important factor in the treatment of their disease,” said Noah Berkowitz, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, Global Development, Hematology, Bristol Myers Squibb. “This validation is an important step toward making CC-486 available to eligible patients in the European Union, who are in need of treatment options with the potential to decrease their risk of relapse and extend their overall survival.”

Results supporting the ide-cel application came from the pivotal Phase 2 KarMMa study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. The study met its primary endpoint of overall response rate and key secondary endpoint of complete response rate. The safety results were consistent with previously reported data for ide-cel.

The CC-486 application is based on the efficacy and safety results of the pivotal Phase 3 QUAZAR® AML-001 study, which met the primary endpoint of improved overall survival for patients receiving AML maintenance treatment with CC-486 versus placebo.

Ide-cel and CC-486 are investigational therapies that are not approved for any indication in any geography.

About Ide-cel

Ide-cel is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy. The ide-cel CAR is comprised of a murine extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) specific for recognizing BCMA, attached to a human CD8 α hinge and transmembrane domain fused to the T cell cytoplasmic signaling domains of CD137 4-1BB and CD3-ζ chain, in tandem. Ide-cel recognizes and binds to BCMA on the surface of multiple myeloma cells leading to CAR T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells.

In addition to the pivotal KarMMa trial evaluating ide-cel in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird bio’s broad clinical development program for ide-cel includes clinical studies (KarMMa-2, KarMMa-3, KarMMa-4) in earlier lines of treatment for patients with multiple myeloma, including newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. For more information visit clinicaltrials.gov.

Ide-cel is being developed as part of a Co-Development, Co-Promotion and Profit Share Agreement between Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird bio. Ide-cel was granted accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on March 26, 2020.

About CC-486

CC-486 is an oral hypomethylating agent that incorporates into DNA and RNA. The main mechanism of action is thought to be hypomethylation of DNA, as well as direct cytotoxicity to abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. Oral dosing of CC-486 allows for extended drug exposure during each treatment cycle to prolong therapeutic activity.2

About KarMMa 3

KarMMa (NCT03361748) is a pivotal, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, multinational, Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in North America and Europe. The primary endpoint of the study is overall response rate as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Complete response rate is a key secondary endpoint. Other efficacy endpoints include time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease evaluated by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay and safety. The study enrolled 140 patients, of whom 128 received ide-cel across the target dose levels of 150-450 x 106CAR+ T cells after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy. All enrolled patients had received at least three prior treatment regimens, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody, and were refractory to their last regimen, defined as progression during or within 60 days of their last therapy.

About QUAZAR AML-001

QUAZAR AML-001 is a Phase 3, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of CC-486 as AML maintenance therapy in patients who achieved first complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following intensive induction chemotherapy (with or without consolidation), who were ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Key secondary endpoints included relapse-free survival (RFS), safety and tolerability, healthcare resource utilization and patient-reported outcomes per the FACIT-Fatigue Scale and EQ-5D questionnaire. The study enrolled 472 patients, randomized 1:1 to receive initially either 300 mg of CC-486 or placebo orally, once daily, for 14 days of a 28-day cycle, plus best supportive care. Patients remained on treatment until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

About Multiple Myeloma

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells.4 The cause of multiple myeloma is not known and currently there is no cure; however, there are a number of treatment options available that can lead to response.4 Patients who have already been treated with some available therapies but continue to have progression of their disease have “relapsed” and “refractory” multiple myeloma, meaning their cancer has returned after they have received initial treatments. Patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, that have been exposed to all three major drug classes, have fewer treatment options and poor outcomes, including shorter response durations and lower overall survival.5 In Europe, over 48,000 people were diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2018.6

About AML

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia. AML starts in the bone marrow but moves quickly into the blood. Unlike in normal blood cell development, in AML, the rapid buildup of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow may interfere with the production of normal blood cells, resulting in decreased healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. AML is a complex, diverse disease associated with multiple genetic mutations and usually worsens quickly and can lead to death if not treated. AML has a high relapse rate, meaning following patients’ initial response to treatment, their disease is likely to return, signifying an unmet need to prolong remission. There are approximately 40,000 people with AML in Europe, and this number has increased in recent years likely due to the aging population.7

33670,BARDA to Fund $1B to AstraZeneca for Research and Development of Novel COVID-19 Vaccines,AstraZeneca advances response to global COVID-19 challenge as it receives first commitments for Oxford’s potential new vaccine,"The $1B support is for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine with its initiation in H2’20 including a P-III trial with 30,000 participants and a pediatric trial.AZ has initiated to provide wider access to University of Oxford’s vaccine and concluded to provide 400M doses has secured total manufacturing capacity for 1B doses with its deliveries in Sep 2020
 AZ is in contract with CEPI, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, WHO for allocation and distribution of vaccine globally and with some of the governments for increasing access. Additionally, AZ has also collaborated with Serum Institute of India and other partners for increase in production and distribution. AZ has finalized its agreement with Oxford University for vaccine, (formerly ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and now AZD1222, following the global development and distribution agreement with University’s Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group
 In Apr 2020, the P-I/II was initiated which involved the assessing AZD1222 in 1,000 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 yrs. in several centers in southern England. The company has also initiated trials to assess Calquence (acalabrutinib) in CALAVI and ACCORD trials while Farxiga (dapagliflozin) in DARE-19 trial for COVID-19 patients","Company working on a number of agreements in parallel to ensure broad and equitable supply of the vaccine throughout the world at no profit during the pandemic
First agreements to supply at least 400 million doses; Company has total capacity sourced for one billion doses through 2020 and into 2021; continues to increase capacity further
More than $1bn US BARDA investment to support development and production of the vaccine 
AstraZeneca is advancing its ongoing response to address the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19, collaborating with a number of countries and multilateral organisations to make the University of Oxford’s vaccine widely accessible around the world in an equitable manner.

The Company has concluded the first agreements for at least 400 million doses and has secured total manufacturing capacity for one billion doses so far and will begin first deliveries in September 2020. AstraZeneca aims to conclude further agreements supported by several parallel supply chains, which will expand capacity further over the next months to ensure the delivery of a globally accessible vaccine.

AstraZeneca today received support of more than $1bn from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine, starting in the fall. The development programme includes a Phase III clinical trial with 30,000 participants and a paediatric trial.

In addition, the Company is engaging with international organisations such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organisation (WHO), for the fair allocation and distribution of the vaccine around the world. AstraZeneca is also in discussions with governments around the world to increase access. Furthermore, AstraZeneca is in discussions with the Serum Institute of India and other potential partners to increase production and distribution.

AstraZeneca recently joined forces with the UK Government to support Oxford University’s vaccine and has progressed rapidly in its efforts to expand access around the world. The Company will supply the UK starting in September and is thankful for the Government’s commitment and overall work on vaccines.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “This pandemic is a global tragedy and it is a challenge for all of humanity. We need to defeat the virus together or it will continue to inflict huge personal suffering and leave long-lasting economic and social scars in every country around the world. We are so proud to be collaborating with Oxford University to turn their ground-breaking work into a medicine that can be produced on a global scale. We would like to thank the US and UK governments for their substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine. We will do everything in our power to make this vaccine quickly and widely available.”

AstraZeneca has now finalised its licence agreement with Oxford University for the recombinant adenovirus vaccine. The licensing of the vaccine, formerly ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and now known as AZD1222, follows the recent global development and distribution agreement with the University’s Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group. AstraZeneca has also agreed to support the establishment of a joint research centre at Oxford University for pandemic preparedness research.

A Phase I/II clinical trial of AZD1222 began last month to assess safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in over 1,000 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years across several trial centres in southern England. Data from the trial is expected shortly which, if positive, would lead to late-stage trials in a number of countries. AstraZeneca recognises that the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical program with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk.

The Company’s comprehensive pandemic response also includes rapid mobilisation of AstraZeneca’s global research efforts to discover novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies to prevent and treat progression of the COVID-19 disease, with the aim of reaching clinical trials in the next three to five months. Additionally, the Company has quickly moved into testing of new and existing medicines to treat the infection, including CALAVI and ACCORD trials underway for Calquence (acalabrutinib) and DARE-19 trial for Farxiga (dapagliflozin) in COVID-19 patients.

Financial considerations

Today’s announcement is not anticipated to have any significant impact on the Company’s financial guidance for 2020; expenses to progress the vaccine are anticipated to be offset by funding by governments.

AZD1222

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, now known as AZD1222, was developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, working with the Oxford Vaccine Group. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold (adenovirus) virus that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack COVID-19 if it later infects the body.

The recombinant adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1) was chosen to generate a strong immune response from a single dose and it is not replicating, so cannot cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual. Vaccines made from the ChAdOx1 virus have been given to more than 320 people to date and have been shown to be safe and well tolerated, although they can cause temporary side effects such as a temperature, influenza-like symptoms, headache or a sore arm.

– Company to Host Conference Call on Tuesday, May 26, 2020 at 8:30 a.m. ET –
SAN DIEGO, May 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Evofem Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVFM) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Phexxi™ (lactic acid, citric acid and potassium bitartrate) vaginal gel for the prevention of pregnancy in females of reproductive potential for use as an on-demand method of contraception.

Phexxi is the first non-hormonal, on-demand, vaginal pH regulator contraceptive designed to maintain vaginal pH within the normal range of 3.5 to 4.5 – an acidic environment that is inhospitable to sperm.

“There have been a limited number of advances in birth control over the last two decades; Phexxi represents an important step forward in women’s health,” said Michael A. Thomas, M.D., Chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. “Many of my patients have cycled through numerous contraceptive options and still have not found the right fit for their sexual and reproductive needs. Phexxi offers women freedom from hormones and control over how they choose to prevent pregnancy. I look forward to offering this new on-demand option to my patients.”

The Company expects to launch Phexxi in early September alongside the Phexxi Concierge Experience, a comprehensive patient and healthcare provider telemedicine support system. This robust offering of services is designed to provide physicians with on-demand educational support, and speed and simplify women’s access to Phexxi. Through this offering, women would be able to secure a prescription, determine their insurance coverage and/or out-of-pocket costs, receive counseling support and refill reminders, and fill their prescription through their local neighborhood pharmacy or an online pharmacy that is expected to deliver Phexxi right to their door.

“The FDA approval of Phexxi means women now have access to a non-hormonal contraceptive option that they control, on their terms, to be used ONLY when they need it,” said Saundra Pelletier, Evofem Biosciences’ Chief Executive Officer. “Empowerment results from innovation and we are proud and excited to deliver new innovation to women in a category ready for change.”

As the first vaginal pH regulator with a unique mechanism of action, the Company is working to have Phexxi covered under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA mandates that private health plans provide coverage with no out-of-pocket costs for one treatment per class in each of the classes identified by the FDA for women in its Birth Control Guide.

Evofem is committed to ensuring access to Phexxi for all women seeking non-hormonal contraception, including for women who are not covered by government or private health plans, and will provide a financial assistance program to enable access for eligible women.

“During my 15-year career at the FDA, I participated in the review and approval of many sexual and reproductive health products, and I believe that Phexxi serves a true unmet need in contraception,” said Lisa Rarick, M.D., former FDA Division Director and Evofem board member. “Phexxi offers women protection and control—on their terms, and at their discretion—without the use of hormones. I am proud to be a part of this team and this moment in history.”

33693,Sanofi and Regeneron Report Positive Results of Dupixent (dupilumab) in P-IIIa Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis Study for EoE,Dupixent® (dupilumab) eosinophilic esophagitis trial meets both co-primary endpoints,"The P-IIIa Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis study involves assessing Dupixent (N=42) (300mg weekly) v/s PBO (N=39) in 81 patients aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).

Dupixent demonstrated significant clinical and anatomic improvements, including the ability to swallow, in Part A of pivotal trial
69% reduction in disease symptoms with Dupixent, compared to 32% for placebo (p=0.0002)
There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis, a condition that impacts patients’ ability to eat
PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – May 22, 2020 – Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced positive results from Part A of the pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in patients 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The trial met both of its co-primary endpoints, as well as all key secondary endpoints. Dupixent is the first and only biologic to show positive and clinically-meaningful results in this population as part of a Phase 3 trial. An ongoing Part B portion of the Phase 3 trial evaluates an additional Dupixent dosing regimen.

EoE is a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly, leading to difficulties swallowing. If untreated, symptoms and inflammation can progress, causing functional damage and scarring of the esophagus. EoE can lead to esophageal food impaction, requiring immediate emergency room visits. Almost half of the patients in this trial had prior procedures such as dilation of their esophagus, and almost three-quarters had previously been treated with corticosteroids. In the U.S., there are approximately 160,000 patients with EoE who are currently treated, of which an estimated 50,000 have failed multiple treatments.There are currently no therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

“Eosinophilic esophagitis can be debilitating, and there are no approved treatment options. It impacts patients’ ability to eat, causes severe pain and often results in repeated emergency room visits and medical procedures,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “These data are particularly impressive as Dupixent not only dramatically reduced eosinophils in the esophagus, but also improved all clinical, anatomic and histologic measures of the disease. In the past, EoE was thought to be a disease caused by eosinophils, but other biologics that decrease the eosinophils in the esophagus did not demonstrate consistent clinical or anatomical improvements. These Dupixent results demonstrate EoE is caused by multiple aspects of type 2 inflammation, driven by interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. EoE is the fourth atopic or type 2 inflammatory disease in which Dupixent has pivotal data demonstrating significant efficacy.”‘

“These data demonstrate Dupixent’s potential to continue to address treatment gaps across the spectrum of type 2 inflammatory diseases as common as asthma and as rare as eosinophilic esophagitis,” said John Reed, M.D, Ph.D, Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “For the first time in a Phase 3 trial, patients reported an improvement in their ability to swallow food. For patients with eosinophilic esophagitis who are living with restricted diets and, in some cases, repeated hospital interventions, these findings are encouraging.”

Part A of the trial enrolled 81 patients (42 with Dupixent, 39 with placebo) aged 12 years and older with EoE, as determined by histological and patient-reported measures. The co-primary endpoints assessed the change from baseline in the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ), a patient-reported measure of difficulty swallowing, and the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf, a measure of an esophageal inflammation, at 24 weeks.

Patients treated with Dupixent 300 mg weekly experienced the following changes by week 24 from baseline:

69% reduction in disease symptoms compared to 32% for placebo (p=0.0002). Disease symptoms were measured by the DSQ scale, where patients experienced a 21.92 point improvement with Dupixent compared to a 9.60 point improvement for placebo, on a 0-84 scale (p=0.0004), the co-primary endpoint; baseline DSQ scores were approximately 34 points.
60% reduction in their esophageal eosinophilic count to a normal range compared to 5% for placebo (p<0.0001), the co-primary endpoint. This was measured by the proportion of patients who achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf (a normal range); mean baseline peak levels were 89 eos/hpf.
39% reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings, compared to 0.6% worsening for placebo. This was measured by the EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EoE-EREFS), where patients experienced a 3.2 point reduction with Dupixent compared to a 0.3 point reduction for placebo (p<0.0001).
The trial demonstrated similar safety results to the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. For the 24-week treatment period, overall rates of adverse events were 86% for Dupixent and 82% for placebo. Adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent included injection site reactions (n=15 for Dupixent and n=12 for placebo) and upper respiratory-tract infections (n=11 for Dupixent and n=6 for placebo). There was one treatment discontinuation in the Dupixent group due to arthralgia.

Detailed results from this trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. Dupixent received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA in 2017 for the potential treatment of EoE. This status is given to investigational medicines intended for the safe and effective treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. The potential use of Dupixent in eosinophilic esophagitis is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Dupixent is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) proteins. Data from Dupixent clinical trials have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis.

About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis Trial
The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adolescents and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. Part A of the trial enrolled 81 patients aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis, as determined by histological and patient-reported measures. In total, 85% of these patients suffered from at least one concurrent atopic condition such as allergic rhinitis, food allergy and asthma. Patients received weekly subcutaneous injections of Dupixent 300 mg or placebo for the 24-week treatment period.

The trial is ongoing, with additional patients enrolling in Part B as well as patients continuing in a 28-week extended active treatment period (Part C).

Dupilumab Development Program
In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying dupilumab in a broad range of clinical development programs for diseases driven by allergic and other type 2 inflammation, including pediatric asthma (6 to 11 years of age, Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 2/3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), and food and environmental allergies (Phase 2). These potential uses are investigational, and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.

Preliminary immunogenicity and safety results expected in July 2020
Phase 2 portion to begin promptly following successful Phase 1 results
GAITHERSBURG, Md., May 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX), a late-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced enrollment of the first participants in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of its coronavirus vaccine candidate, NVX‑CoV2373, a stable, prefusion protein made using its proprietary nanoparticle technology. NVX‑CoV2373 includes Novavax’ proprietary Matrix‑M™ adjuvant to enhance immune responses and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Preliminary immunogenicity and safety results from the Phase 1 portion of the trial are expected in July 2020.

“Administering our vaccine in the first participants of this clinical trial is a significant achievement, bringing us one step closer toward addressing the fundamental need for a vaccine in the fight against the global COVID‑19 pandemic,” said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Novavax. “We look forward to sharing the clinical results in July and, if promising, quickly initiating the Phase 2 portion of the trial.”

The Phase 1/2 clinical trial is being conducted in two parts. The Phase 1 portion is a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of NVX‑CoV2373, both adjuvanted with Matrix‑M and unadjuvanted. The trial is enrolling approximately 130 healthy participants 18 to 59 years of age at two sites in Australia. The protocol’s two-dose trial regimen assesses two dose sizes (5 and 25 micrograms) with Matrix‑M and without.

The Phase 2 portion is expected to be conducted in multiple countries, including the United States, and would assess immunity, safety and COVID‑19 disease reduction in a broader age range. This Phase 1/2 approach allows for rapid advancement of NVX‑CoV2373 during the pandemic. The trial is being supported by the recently announced funding arrangement with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

Novavax identified NVX‑CoV2373 as its lead SARS-CoV-2 candidate following pre-clinical testing that demonstrated high immunogenicity and high levels of neutralizing antibodies. These results provide strong evidence that the vaccine candidate will be highly immunogenic in humans, potentially leading to protection from COVID‑19 and thus helping to control the spread of this disease.

Dr. Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI said, “Entering clinical trials is an important step on the path to delivering a safe, effective and globally accessible vaccine against COVID-19. Vaccines provide our best hope of permanently defeating this pandemic, so it is encouraging to see rapid progress being made in the development of Novavax’ vaccine candidate. CEPI’s priority in building our portfolio has been to focus on vaccine candidates with the potential to be developed at speed and scale and made globally accessible. Our investment in Novavax allows us to focus on manufacturing in parallel with the clinical development of the vaccine, so that if the vaccine is proven to be safe and effective, we can make doses available to those who need them without delay.”

33726,AstraZeneca Signs an Agreement with ArcherDX for Utilizing Personalized Cancer Assays to Detect MRD in Patients with Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,AstraZeneca collaborates with ArcherDX to use personalised cancer assays to detect minimal residual disease in lung cancer trials,"AstraZeneca will utilize ArcherDX’s personalized assay in P-III MERMAID-1 study assessing the effect of adjuvant treatment with Imfinzi (durvalumab) + CT vs CT as monothx. in ~330 patients with resected (Stage II-III) NSCLC who have undergone complete resection of the primary tumor
 The 1EPs is DFS for patients showing MRD, which will be tested using personalized ctDNA assay based on whole-exome sequencing of patient samples.
 ArcherDX will perform whole-exome sequencing of samples of patients with NSCLC and generate personalized ctDNA assays to test MRD that remains after a patient’s surgery. The ongoing development of assays is informed by the TRACERx study, funded by Cancer Research UK and led by UCL and the Francis Crick Institute","Collaboration to focus on newly launched global Phase III MERMAID-1 trial for patients with resected, early-stage non-small cell lung cancer
AstraZeneca will collaborate with ArcherDX, a genomic analysis company focused on precision oncology, to use personalised cancer monitoring to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

ArcherDX’s personalised assay will be used in AstraZeneca’s recently launched Phase III MERMAID-1 trial to evaluate the effect of adjuvant treatment with Imfinzi (durvalumab) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone on disease-free survival (DFS). The trial is in patients with completely resected, Stage II and III NSCLC who show evidence of MRD suggesting a high risk of relapse.

MRD describes a very small number of otherwise undetectable cancer cells that shed circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. Monitoring for the presence of MRD using ctDNA may provide valuable information on how well a treatment is working, inform prognosis, and detect if a patient’s cancer has returned. Ultimately, MRD detection may enable physicians to intervene earlier and tailor the best treatment options for individual cancer patients.

Charles Swanton, MD, PhD, Professor at UCL and the Francis Crick Institute, Chief Clinician at Cancer Research UK, leader of Tracking Cancer Evolution through Therapy (Rx) (TRACERx) and international coordinating investigator in the MERMAID-1 trial, said: “MERMAID-1 is a novel randomised trial using ctDNA to identify patients at high risk of recurrence after surgery who may benefit from intervention with immunotherapy. We hope this approach will lead to better patient outcomes by intensifying treatment for patients most likely to relapse, while avoiding additional chemotherapy after surgery when not needed.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President of Oncology R&D, said: “While detecting and monitoring for minimal residual disease has proven challenging in solid tumours, the MERMAID-1 trial and this partnership stand to break new ground in lung cancer. This innovative endeavour is reflective of our strategy to improve cancer outcomes by treating patients as early as possible. It is in this early setting that the chance of cure is higher and identifying personalised, effective treatments could increase survival and improve quality of life.”

Jason Myers, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of ArcherDX, said: “While there has been progress in improving adoption of precision oncology for patients with late-stage cancers, there is a pressing need to accelerate access to precision oncology for all patients diagnosed with cancer regardless of the stage or location of the care setting. AstraZeneca shares this critical mission, and we are pleased to partner with them in the development of biomarker-driven therapies and the expansion of personalised cancer monitoring for all patients.”

Under the terms of the agreement, ArcherDX will perform whole exome sequencing of NSCLC patient samples and generate highly sensitive, personalised ctDNA assays to test for MRD that remains after a patient’s successful surgery. The ongoing development of these assays is informed by the TRACERx study, funded by Cancer Research UK and led by UCL and the Francis Crick Institute.

Imfinzi is being tested in an extensive development programme in lung cancer with several ongoing Phase III trials in earlier stages of NSCLC in potentially curative settings.

Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.1 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.2Approximately 39% of patients with NSCLC present with localized or regional lung cancer, where surgery (complete resection) may be an option.3 Among Stage II-III patients who undergo surgery, up to 60% eventually develop recurrence.4

MERMAID-1

MERMAID-1 is a randomized, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial evaluating adjuvant Imfinzi in combination with chemotherapy versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in approximately 330 patients diagnosed with resectable (Stage II-III) NSCLC who have undergone complete resection of the primary tumour. The primary endpoint is DFS for patients who show evidence of MRD, which will be tested using a highly sensitive, personalised ctDNA assay based on whole exome sequencing of patient samples.

Collaboration between AstraZeneca and ArcherDX

ArcherDX’s personalised cancer monitoring (PCM) technology is intended to detect MRD in early-stage cancer patients following surgery, and it has received a Breakthrough Device Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration. ArcherDX plans to leverage the PCM assays to develop companion diagnostics for AstraZeneca’s selected medicines, and together, the companies plan to seek regulatory approval if clinical trials are completed successfully. The assays are currently for investigational use only.

PCM, TRACERx and Cancer Research UK

TRACERx (Tracking Cancer Evolution through therapy (Rx)), which informs the ongoing development of the ArcherDX PCM assay, is the single biggest investment in lung cancer research by Cancer Research UK. Taking place over nine years, the translational research programme is the first study to look at the evolution of cancer in real time and immense detail. Researchers follow patients with lung cancer all the way from diagnosis through to either disease relapse or cure after surgery, tracking and analysing how their cancer develops. TRACERx is led by University College London and the Francis Crick Institute via the Cancer Research UK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence and also supported by the National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre and the Rosetrees Trust.

Imfinzi

Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

Imfinzi is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. Imfinzi is approved for the 1st-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC in combination with SoC chemotherapy in the US and Singapore. Imfinzi is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and a small number of other countries.

As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.

AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. AstraZeneca aims to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFRm tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with the approved medicines Iressa (gefitinib) and Tagrisso, and its ongoing Phase III trials LAURA, and FLAURA2.5-7

AstraZeneca is committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing Phase II trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD which test Tagrisso in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines. Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate is in development for metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC including trials in combination with other anticancer treatments.

An extensive late-stage Immuno-Oncology programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.8 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially curative settings (Phase III trials MERMAID-1, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. Imfinzi is also in development in the Phase II combination trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline.

AstraZeneca in Immuno-Oncology

Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes Imfinzi as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

AstraZeneca in Oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca’s main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.

By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

Each of these three compounds are currently in late-stage global clinical development across many countries outside of China. Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 anti-programmed death-1 (“PD-1”) monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc receptor gamma (“FcγR”), which is believed to play an essential role in activating phagocytosis in macrophages, to minimize its negative impact on T effector cells. Fruquintinib is designed to improve kinase selectivity against vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (“VEGFR”) in order to minimize off-target toxicities, and thereby provide consistent coverage and better tolerability, which is very important in combinations. Surufatinib, a VEGFR inhibitor, inhibits colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (“CSF-1R”) additionally, thereby blocking the accumulation of tumor associated macrophages and promoting infiltration of T effector cells into tumors, leading to possible synergistic anti-tumor activity with PD-1 inhibitors.

Tislelizumab and fruquintinib have both been approved by the China National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”), which is also currently reviewing the New Drug Application (“NDA”) for surufatinib that was submitted late last year.

About Tislelizumab

Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is a humanized IgG4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to FcγR on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Tislelizumab is the first drug from BeiGene’s immuno-oncology biologics program and is being developed internationally as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers.

Tislelizumab is approved by the China NMPA as a treatment for patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (“cHL”) who received at least two prior therapies and for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with PD-L1 high expression whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Currently, 15 potentially registration-enabling clinical trials are being conducted in China and globally, including 11 Phase 3 trials and four pivotal Phase 2 trials.

Tislelizumab is not approved for use outside of China.

About Fruquintinib

Fruquintinib is a highly selective and potent oral inhibitor of VEGFR 1/2/3. VEGFR inhibitors play a pivotal role in blocking tumor angiogenesis. Fruquintinib was designed to improve kinase selectivity to minimize off-target toxicities, improve tolerability and provide more consistent target coverage. The generally good tolerability in patients to date, along with fruquintinib’s low potential for drug-drug interaction based on preclinical assessment, suggests that it may be highly suitable for combinations with other anti-cancer therapies.

Fruquintinib was approved for marketing in China by the NMPA in September 2018 and commercially launched by Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”) in late November 2018 under the brand name Elunate®. Elunate® is for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, including those who have previously received anti-VEGF therapy and/or anti-EGFR therapy (RAS wild type). Results of the FRESCO study, a Phase III pivotal registration trial of fruquintinib in 416 patients with colorectal cancer (“CRC”) in China, were published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA, in June 2018 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02314819).

Chi-Med retains all rights to fruquintinib outside of China and is partnered with Lilly in China.

Global development of fruquintinib in CRC: We intend to initiate a Phase III registration study, known as the FRESCO-2 study, in the U.S., Europe and Japan in CRC. FRESCO-2 is expected to start enrolling patients in mid-2020. Based on our agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FRESCO and FRESCO-2 studies, if positive, could support our NDA application.

Gastric Cancer in China: In October 2017, we initiated the FRUTIGA study, a randomized, double-blind, Phase III study in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with paclitaxel (Taxol®) compared with paclitaxel monotherapy in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have progressed after first-line standard chemotherapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03223376). Over 540 patients are expected to be enrolled into the FRUTIGA study at a 1:1 ratio with the primary endpoint of this study being overall survival (OS). In April 2019, we conducted the first interim analysis of the FRUTIGA study for futility. Following the analysis of safety and efficacy of the first 100 patients, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (“IDMC”) recommended to continue the study without changes. We expect to conduct a second interim analysis in mid-2020 and complete enrollment of the study in 2020.

Immunotherapy combinations: In November 2018, we entered into two collaboration agreements to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of fruquintinib in combination with PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, including with Tyvyt® (sintilimab) and geptanolimab (GB226, genolimzumab).

Fruquintinib is not approved for use outside of China.

About Surufatinib

Surufatinib is a novel, oral angio-immuno kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity associated with VEGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), which both inhibit angiogenesis, and CSF-1R, which regulates tumor-associated macrophages, promoting the body’s immune response against tumor cells. Its unique dual mechanism of action may be very suitable for possible combinations with other immunotherapies, where there may be synergistic anti-tumor effects.

Chi-Med currently retains all rights to surufatinib worldwide.

Neuroendocrine tumors (“NET”) in the U.S., Europe and Japan: We are preparing for regulatory interactions in the U.S., Europe and Japan to confirm clinical development and path to registration, based on the robust data from the two positive Phase III studies of surufatinib in NET in China, and the ongoing multi-cohort Phase Ib study in the U.S. (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02549937). In the U.S., surufatinib was granted Fast Track Designations for development in pancreatic and non-pancreatic (extra-pancreatic) NET in April 2020, and Orphan Drug Designation for pancreatic NET in November 2019.

Non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in China: In November 2019, a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for surufatinib for the treatment of patients with advanced non-pancreatic NET was accepted for review by the China NMPA and granted Priority Review status in December 2019. The NDA is supported by data from the successful SANET-ep study, a Phase III study of surufatinib in advanced neuroendocrine tumors – extra-pancreatic patients in China for whom there is no effective therapy. A 198-patient interim analysis was conducted in June 2019, leading the IDMC to determine that the study met the pre-defined primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) and should be stopped early. The positive results of this trial were highlighted in an oral presentation at the 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02588170).

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in China: In 2016, we initiated the SANET-p study, which is a pivotal Phase III study in patients with low- or intermediate-grade, advanced pancreatic NET in China. A second NDA for surufatinib for the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic NET is being prepared for submission, following an interim analysis review conducted in January 2020 by the IDMC that recommended the registrational study be terminated early as the pre-defined primary endpoint of PFS had already been met (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02589821). Study results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific conference.

Biliary tract cancer in China: In March 2019, we initiated a Phase IIb/III study comparing surufatinib with capecitabine in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer whose disease progressed on first-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is overall survival (“OS”) (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03873532).

Immunotherapy combinations: In November 2018 and September 2019, we entered into collaboration agreements to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of surufatinib in combination with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, including with Tuoyi® (toripalimab) and Tyvyt®, which are approved in China.

33759,Merck Reports Three Major Initiatives Focusing on Developing Vaccine Against COVID-19,Merck to Acquire Themis,"Merck will acquire all outstanding shares of Themis in exchange for an undisclosed cash payment. The acquisition follows the ongoing collaboration between the two companies to develop vaccine candidates utilizing the measles virus vector platform and is expected to accelerate the development of Themis’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate with the anticipated initiation of clinical study in later 2020
 Secondly, Merck collaborated with IAVI to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. The collaboration leverages complementary expertise and capabilities with rVSV technology to advance the novel vaccine candidate. Moreover, Merck collaborated with BARDA to provide initial funding support for this effort
 Additionally, Merck collaborated with Ridgeback to develop EIDD-2801 against COVID-19. Ridgeback Bio will receive up front, milestones and a share of the net proceeds of EIDD-2801 and related molecules, if approved, while Merck to get exclusive global rights and will be responsible for clinical development, regulatory filings and manufacturing","KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Themis, a company focused on vaccines and immune-modulation therapies for infectious diseases and cancer, today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire privately-held Themis.

Themis has a broad pipeline of vaccine candidates and immune-modulatory therapies developed using its innovative measles virus vector platform based on a vector originally developed by scientists at the Institut Pasteur, a world-leading European vaccine research institute, and licensed exclusively to Themis for select viral indications. In March, Themis joined a consortium together with the Institut Pasteur and The Center for Vaccine Research at the University of Pittsburgh, supported by funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), to develop a vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2 for the prevention of COVID-19.

“Building on the pioneering work of the Institut Pasteur, the Themis team has established specialized expertise that complements Merck’s own capabilities in the discovery, development, manufacturing and global distribution of vaccines,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are eager to combine our strengths both to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine in the near term and to build a pandemic preparedness capability directed toward emerging agents that pose a future epidemic threat.”

The planned acquisition builds upon an ongoing collaboration between the two companies to develop vaccine candidates using the measles virus vector platform, and is expected to accelerate the development of Themis’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The vaccine candidate is in pre-clinical development, and clinical studies are planned to start later in 2020.

Under terms of the agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all outstanding shares of Themis in exchange for an undisclosed cash payment. Upon completion of the deal Themis will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck.

“This acquisition by Merck, a global leader in vaccine development, reflects Themis’ success in applying our versatile immune-modulation platform that builds on the original discoveries from the Institut Pasteur,” said Dr. Erich Tauber, chief executive officer, Themis. “We are excited for the next phase of our relationship with Merck and in the near-term look forward to focusing resources toward the development and global scale-up of our candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.”

“I am delighted that the vaccine technology initially developed at the Institut Pasteur, and enhanced in partnership with Themis, will now be leveraged by Merck to develop candidate vaccines designed to prevent and control emerging infectious diseases, notably COVID-19. This is an exciting and impactful development for global public health,” commented Prof. Stewart Cole, president of Institut Pasteur.

Investments by CEPI were important to advancing the Themis technology platform and associated programs. Merck looks forward to continued collaboration with CEPI and other international organizations as we work together toward global access to potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Closing of the transaction is subject to the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, merger control clearance in Austria, and other customary conditions. In connection with the transaction, Institut Pasteur, CEPI and Merck have entered into a memorandum of understanding that reflects the parties’ commitments to address the COVID-19 pandemic by developing, manufacturing and distributing the vaccine on a global basis and with pricing that makes the vaccine both available around the world and accessible to those who need it, including low-income, middle-income and high-income countries based on the medical need when the vaccine may become available.

Merck is a global leader in infectious diseases and vaccines, with a long history of researching, developing, manufacturing and distributing vaccines for children, adolescents and adults. Merck is committed to ensuring that any vaccines we develop for SARS-CoV-2 will be accessible and affordable globally, and plans to manufacture the vaccine at sites in the U.S. and Europe.

Measles Vector Platform

The measles vector platform is being evaluated across a wide range of infectious disease and immunology indications. It uses a modified measles vaccine virus as a vector and can be engineered to express a wide range of antigens. The measles vector is designed to provide a vehicle to deliver antigens to the immune system capable of triggering a protective memory response. It has been incorporated into vaccine development programs against infectious diseases including SARS, Chikungunya, MERS, and Lassa fever. Originally developed at the Institut Pasteur, the technology platform was first licensed to Themis in 2010.

Merck’s response to coronavirus (COVID-19)

As a company dedicated to saving and improving lives, Merck recognizes that we have a special responsibility to help. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Merck is focused on protecting the safety of its employees and their families, ensuring that our supply of medicines and vaccines reaches our patients and customers, contributing our scientific expertise to the development of antiviral and vaccine approaches, and supporting health care providers and our communities. We thank the many health care providers and volunteers, including our own employees, who are doing so much to help affected patients and communities.

The clinical study for Ifenprodil, 20 mg tablets, is entitled, “A Randomized Open Label Phase 2b/3 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of NP-120 (Ifenprodil) for the Treatment of Confirmed COVID-19 Infected Hospitalized Patients.” As part of the multinational Phase 2b/3 COVID-19 clinical study, Algernon has already received clearance in Canada and has also filed for ethics approval in Australia.

“We have already started communicating with a number of U.S. based research institutions in advance, to make sure that we can move quickly with the U.S. part of the clinical trial, if approved,” said Christopher J. Moreau, CEO of Algernon Pharmaceuticals Inc. “We have identified strong interest to participate in the study and we look forward to starting the trial as soon as possible.”

The Company cautions that while it is preparing to begin Phase 2 clinical trials shortly, it is not making any express or implied claims that Ifenprodil is an effective treatment for acute lung injury (ALI), the COVID-19 virus, or any other medical condition at this time.

Phase 2b/3 Study Summary:

Once local ethics approvals have been received, the trial will begin as a Phase 2b study of an aggregate of 100 patients and with positive preliminary data, the clinical trial will move directly from a Phase 2b into a Phase 3 trial. The data will determine the number of expected patients needed to reach statistical significance in the Phase 3 trial.

Patients will be randomized in a one-to-one manner and will either be treated using an existing standard of care, or standard of care plus a 20mg dose of Ifenprodil taken three times a day for two weeks.

Over the testing period, doctors will observe whether there is an improvement in a number of secondary endpoints, including mortality, blood oxygen levels, time spent in intensive care and time to mechanical ventilation.

About NP-120 (Ifenprodil)

NP-120 (Ifenprodil) is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist specifically targeting the NMDA-type subunit 2B (Glu2NB). Ifenprodil prevents glutamate signalling. The NMDA receptor is found on many tissues including lung cells and T-cells, neutrophils.

The Company believes NP-120 can reduce the infiltration of neutrophils and T-cells into the lungs where they can release glutamate and cytokines respectively. The latter can result in the highly problematic cytokine storm that contributes to the loss of lung function and ultimately death as has been reported in COVID-19 infected patients.

About Algernon Pharmaceuticals Inc.

RIDGEFIELD, Conn. and INDIANAPOLIS, May 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE:LLY) today announced an academic research collaboration with the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) on a new trial, EMPACT-MI (EMPAgliflozin for the prevention of Chronic heart failure and morTality after an acute Myocardial Infarction). The collaboration will investigate whether Jardiance® (empagliflozin) can improve outcomes and prevent heart failure in adults with and without diabetes who have had an acute myocardial infarction, more commonly known as a heart attack. This randomized clinical trial will be conducted, analyzed and reported in partnership with the DCRI, with Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly providing funding.

EMPACT-MI will include approximately 3,300 adults across at least 16 countries who have had an acute myocardial infarction. The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the effect of Jardiance on all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure. The trial will be part of the EMPOWER program, the broadest and most comprehensive clinical trial program exploring the impact of Jardiance on the lives of people with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions.

“This collaboration represents an important step in understanding how to safeguard and protect the lives of patients with acute myocardial infarction,” said Adrian Hernandez, M.D., M.H.S., co-chair of the EMPACT-MI trial and DCRI executive director. “Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death in cardiology, and this is the first trial in the SGLT2 inhibitor class to investigate the potential to increase survival and decrease progression to heart failure in people who have had a recent myocardial infarction.”

Javed Butler, M.D., M.P.H., M.B.A., chair of the EMPACT-MI trial and professor and chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of Mississippi, added, “We are delighted to lead the EMPACT-MI trial to find out whether Jardiance could become a new standard of care option to improve the outcomes and lives of people with acute myocardial infarction.”

Pragmatic clinical trials focus on the relationship between treatments and outcomes in real-world health system practice. This partnership will leverage the DCRI’s experience in pragmatic trials by implementing innovative and efficient trial elements, including remote follow-up and a focused data collection approach, which enable a strong patient focus while maintaining high data quality.

“We are pleased to collaborate with the Duke Clinical Research Institute on the EMPACT-MI trial to investigate the potential to increase survival and prevent heart failure from developing in adults who have had a heart attack. Despite current therapies, these patients have a high residual risk that could be addressed by the multiple benefits we have observed with SGLT2 inhibition,” said Waheed Jamal, M.D., corporate vice president and head of CardioMetabolic Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim.

“The EMPACT-MI trial is part of our broad and comprehensive clinical development program, which aims to explore how Jardiance can improve health outcomes and fill therapeutic gaps for a broad range of patients suffering from cardio-renal-metabolic conditions,” said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly.

About Acute Myocardial Infarction
Ischemic heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, with over 7 million acute myocardial infarctions occurring every year around the world. People who suffer an acute myocardial infarction are at a high risk of heart failure and death. Heart attacks occur when the blood supply to an area of the heart is blocked by a blood clot or by atherosclerosis (fatty deposits or plaques lining vessel walls), causing heart tissue to die. Rapid diagnosis and treatment to restore blood flow through the affected vessel are vital to save as much of the heart tissue as possible.

About Heart Failure
Heart failure is a progressive, debilitating and potentially fatal condition that occurs when the heart cannot supply adequate circulation to meet the body’s demands for oxygenated blood or to do so requires increased blood volume leading to fluid accumulation (congestion) in the lungs and peripheral tissues. It is a widespread condition affecting 60 million people worldwide and expected to increase as the population ages. Heart failure is highly prevalent in people with diabetes; however, approximately half of all people with heart failure do not have diabetes.

The Jardiance heart failure program was initiated based on data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, which assessed the effect of Jardiance (10 mg or 25 mg once daily) added to standard of care compared with placebo added to standard of care. EMPA-REG OUTCOME was the first SGLT2 inhibitor trial to show a relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. This population was comprised of more than 45% of adults with a prior myocardial infarction.

What is JARDIANCE? (www.jardiance.com)
JARDIANCE is a prescription medicine used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes.

JARDIANCE is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes who have known cardiovascular disease.

JARDIANCE is not for people with type 1 diabetes or for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine).

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Do not take JARDIANCE if you are allergic to empagliflozin or any of the ingredients in JARDIANCE.

Do not take JARDIANCE if you have severe kidney problems or are on dialysis.

JARDIANCE can cause serious side effects, including:

Dehydration. JARDIANCE can cause some people to have dehydration (the loss of body water and salt). Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, light-headed, or weak, especially when you stand up.
You may be at a higher risk of dehydration if you:

Total transaction value of up to $500 million

May 26, 2020 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Tetra Therapeutics today announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement for Shionogi & Co., Ltd. to acquire Tetra. With this acquisition, Shionogi will obtain global rights to Tetra’s entire portfolio of compounds for the treatment of brain disorders associated with cognitive and memory deficits, notably BPN14770, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase‐4D (PDE4D).

The two companies entered into a collaboration and investment agreement in 2018 and earlier this year announced an expanded alliance to develop and commercialize BPN14770 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and other indications. Currently, Tetra is conducting a Phase II study in FXS and recently completed a Phase II study in AD in the United States.

“With over a decade of research, development and investment, Tetra has demonstrated the unique ability of allosteric inhibitors of phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D) to deliver disease-modifying potential in central nervous system (CNS) disorders,” said Mark Gurney, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tetra Therapeutics. “Shionogi has been a valued partner for the last two and half years, and with the company’s development and commercialization expertise, we believe Shionogi is ideally positioned to bring the potential of our platform to patients and provide new treatment options within these areas of urgent medical need. This is a great outcome for our investors and stakeholders.”

“We are excited to combine Tetra’s portfolio with our drug development capabilities to further advance BPN14770 in CNS disorders, including AD and FXS,” said Dr. Isao Teshirogi, President and Chief Executive Officer, Shionogi & Co., Ltd. “Tetra’s deep level of drug discovery know-how in the CNS area will help us to solve for the cognitive disorders our ageing population is facing, and we believe we are well-positioned to bring BPN14770 to patients in need.”

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Tetra will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Shionogi, and Shionogi will have global rights to BPN14770 and all Tetra compounds. Based on the achievement of certain predetermined regulatory and commercial milestones the total transaction value may be up to $500 million.

About BPN14770

BPN14770 is a novel therapeutic agent that selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase-4D to enhance early and late stages of memory formation. This unique mechanism of action has the potential to improve cognitive and memory function in devastating CNS disorders, including FXS, AD and other dementias, learning/developmental disabilities and schizophrenia. Preclinical animal models show that BPN14770 has the potential to promote the maturation of connections between neurons, which is impaired in patients with FXS, and to protect connections between neurons which otherwise are lost in patients with AD. Tetra currently is completing an investigational Phase 2 study of BPN14770 in adults with FXS, an indication for which BPN14770 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Glenmark is the first company to receive DCGI’s approval to conduct clinical trials of Favipiravir against COVID-19 in India","Glenmark received approval from the Indian regulator to initiate the study
The combination study which will be called the FAITH trial will look to enroll 158 hospitalized patients of moderate COVID-19 in India
Early treatment with combination therapy will be evaluated for safety and efficacy as it is emerging as an effective approach in shortening duration of virus shedding, decreasing cytokine response, and facilitating early discharge of patients1
Antivirals with different mechanisms of action could complement and enhance efficacy against COVID-19
Glenmark also continues its Phase 3 clinical trials on antiviral Favipiravir monotherapy for COVID-19 patients in India
MUMBAI, May 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, a research-led, integrated global pharmaceutical company, has announced a new randomized, open-label study to test the combined efficacy of two antiviral drugs Favipiravir and Umifenovir as a potential COVID-19 treatment strategy. The two antiviral drugs have different mechanism of action, and their combination may demonstrate improved treatment efficacy by effectively tackling high viral loads in patients during early stage of disease.

Early administration of a combination of antiviral medications acting by different mechanisms is desirable for the treatment of COVID-19, since the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks around the time of symptom onset.2 Thus combining antiviral drugs could result in greater clinical effectiveness and could also prevent, or delay, the emergence of resistance. Favipiravir is an oral antiviral drug approved in Japan since 2014 for the treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections.3 It has a unique mechanism of action by which it inhibits viral replication: it is converted into an active phosphoribosylated form (favipiravir-RTP) in cells and recognized as a substrate by viral RNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting RNA polymerase activity that is required for viral replication.4 Umifenovir is another oral antiviral drug licensed for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B infections in Russia and China.5 Umifenovir impedes the viral attachment to cells and acts as a viral entry inhibitor.5 Additionally it exhibits modulatory effects on the immune system and induces interferon-production. Hence a combined use of Favipiravir and Umifenovir acting on different mechanisms offers a comprehensive antiviral cover on pre-entry and post-entry life-cycle of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Both Favipiravir and Umifenovir inhibited virus infection in vitro5,6 and have shown efficacy in COVID-19 clinical trials. The current Glenmark study will examine whether early administration of a combination of Favipiravir and Umifenovir, both acting by different mechanisms, enhances antiviral efficacy on COVID-19 patients.

Commenting on this development, Dr. Monika Tandon, Vice President & Head, Clinical Development Global Specialty/Branded Portfolio, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., said, “Combining antiviral agents that have a good safety profile and act on different stages of viral life-cycle is an effective treatment approach to rapidly suppress initial high viral load and lead to overall improvement in clinical parameters. We consider Glenmark’s study will be pivotal in leading to identification of highly effective and safe treatments against COVID-19 in India. Beyond its many potential patient treatment benefits, we also hope the combination therapy will reduce infection risk amongst medical professionals and healthcare workers by reducing the duration of virus shedding from treated patients.”

Further, Mr. Sujesh Vasudevan, President, India Formulations, Middle East and Africa business, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., mentioned, “This is another step in our effort is to launch a treatment for COVID-19 patients and we are looking at every possibility. We will do all it takes to ensure accessibility of the product across the country if the clinical trials are successful.”

The new combination clinical trial will be called FAITH – (FA vipiravir plus Um I fenovir (efficacy & safety) T rial in Indian Hospital setting). 158 hospitalized patients of moderate COVID-19 infection will be enrolled in the combination study and randomized in two groups: one group receiving Favipiravir and Umifenovir (with standard supportive care); and one group receiving Favipiravir along with standard supportive care. Patients in the arm receiving the drug will receive Faviprivir 1800mg bid and Umifenovir 800 mg bid on Day 1. Thereafter patients would receive Faviprivir 800mg bid and Unifenovir 800mg bid for the remaining course of the treatment. Duration of treatment will be 14 days and patients will be discharged after clinical cure and two consecutive negative tests for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.

Simultaneously, Glenmark is also conducting phase 3 clinical trials of Favipiravir as a COVID-19 monotherapy option with 150 patients, enrolled from 9 leading government and private hospitals across the country. So far 30 patients have been randomised. The monotherapy phase 3 clinical trial results are expected by July/August 2020. Glenmark was the first pharmaceutical company to receive approval from drug regulator DCGI to conduct Favipiravir clinical trials against COVID-19 in India.

May 27, 2020 01:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced positive topline results from the Phase III Archway study, evaluating Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS) in people living with neovascular or “wet” age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). PDS is a permanent refillable eye implant, approximately the size of a grain of rice, which continuously delivers a customized formulation of ranibizumab over a period of months. The Archway trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that patients with PDS who received refills every six months achieved visual acuity outcomes equivalent to those receiving monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg injections. In Archway, PDS was generally well-tolerated with a favorable benefit-risk profile.

“We look forward to presenting detailed Archway results at future medical meetings and discussing these data with regulatory authorities, with the aim of bringing this new treatment option to patients as soon as possible.”

Neovascular AMD is a leading cause of blindness in people aged 60 and older in the United States.1 The current standard of care for nAMD requires patients to visit their ophthalmologist as often as monthly for eye injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy to help maintain vision gains and/or prevent vision loss.2 This high treatment burden with anti-VEGF therapy can lead to under-treatment of nAMD and, potentially, less than optimal vision outcomes.2,3

“For people around the world receiving frequent eye injections for neovascular AMD, this continuous delivery system could greatly reduce their treatment burden,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Genentech’s chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We look forward to presenting detailed Archway results at future medical meetings and discussing these data with regulatory authorities, with the aim of bringing this new treatment option to patients as soon as possible.”

In addition to Archway, the Portal study is investigating the long-term safety and tolerability of PDS for the treatment of nAMD.4Furthermore, PDS is also being studied in the Pagoda trial for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), a vision-threatening complication of diabetes.5

Full results from the Archway study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to health authorities around the world, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, for consideration of regulatory approval for the treatment of nAMD.

About the Archway Study6

Archway (NCT03677934) is a randomized, multicenter, open-label Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS), refilled every six months at fixed intervals, compared to monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.5 mg in 418 people living with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The primary endpoint of the study is the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score (the best distance vision a person can achieve – including with correction such as glasses – when reading letters on an eye chart) from baseline at the average of week 36 and week 40. Secondary endpoints include safety; overall change in BCVA from baseline; and change from baseline in center point thickness over time.

About Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for activities like reading and is a leading cause of blindness for people age 60 and over in the U.S.1 Neovascular or “wet” AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease that can cause rapid and severe vision loss.7 Approximately 11 million people in the United States have some form of AMD and of those about 1.1 million have nAMD.7

Neovascular AMD is caused by growth of abnormal blood vessels, also referred to as choroidal neovascularization (CNV), into the macula. These vessels leak fluid and blood and cause scar tissue that destroys the central retina. This process results in a deterioration of sight over a period of months to years.

About Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS)

Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS) is a permanent refillable eye implant, approximately the size of a grain of rice, which is designed to continuously release a customized formulation of ranibizumab into the eye over time. Ranibizumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to bind to and inhibit VEGF-A, a protein that is believed to play a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels and the leakiness of the vessels.8 PDS contains a customized formulation of ranibizumab not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is different from the ranibizumab intravitreal injection, a medicine marketed as Lucentis® (ranibizumab injection) which is FDA-approved to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and other retinal diseases.

By maintaining therapeutic drug concentration levels of ranibizumab with two refills per year, PDS may offer greater outcomes certainty in terms of vision gains and maintaining those gains for people living with nAMD. Additionally, by decreasing the need for frequent injections and physician visits, PDS may reduce the burden of treatment associated with standard anti-VEGF treatments.2 The Archway trial of PDS in nAMD is evaluating a regimen of PDS implantation followed by twice yearly refills.

About Lucentis® (ranibizumab injection)

Lucentis is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to bind to and inhibit VEGF-A, a protein that is believed to play a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and the hyperpermeability (leakiness) of the vessels.

Lucentis is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV).

Lucentis was developed by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. The company retains commercial rights in the U.S. and Novartis has exclusive commercial rights for the rest of the world.

Outside the U.S., Lucentis is approved in more than 120 countries to treat adult patients with wet AMD, for the treatment of visual impairment due to DME, due to macular edema secondary to both branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV).

Lucentis Important Safety Information

Patients should not use Lucentis if they have an infection in or around the eye or are allergic to Lucentis or any of its ingredients.

Lucentis is a prescription medication given by injection into the eye, and it has side effects. Some Lucentis patients have had detached retinas and serious infections inside the eye. If your eye becomes red, sensitive to light, or painful, or if there is a change in vision, call or visit your eye doctor right away.

Some patients have had increased eye pressure before and within 1 hour of an injection.

Uncommonly, Lucentis patients have had serious, sometimes fatal, problems related to blood clots, such as heart attacks or strokes.

Fatal events were seen more often in patients with DME and DR with Lucentis compared with patients who did not receive Lucentis. Although there were only few fatal events which included causes of death typical of patients with advanced diabetic complications, these events may be caused by Lucentis.

Some Lucentis patients have serious side effects related to the injection. These include serious infections inside the eye, detached retinas, and cataracts. The most common eye-related side effects are increased redness in the white of the eye, eye pain, small specks in vision, and increased eye pressure. The most common non–eye related side effects are nose and throat infections, anemia, nausea and cough.

Patients may report side effects to the FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch. Patients may also report side effects to Genentech at (888) 835-2555.

33847,Sanofi's Dupixent (dupilumab) Receives the US FDA's Approval as First Biologic for Children Aged 6-11 Years with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis,Sanofi: FDA approves Dupixent (dupilumab) as first biologic medicine for children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,"The FDA approval is based on P-III study assessing Dupixent + TCS vs TCS as monothx. in children with severe AD. In the trial, children treated with Dupixent and TCS experienced improvements in overall disease severity, skin clearance and itch
 Results @16wks.: Dupixent (q4w & q2w) improvement in average EASI patients receiving (84% vs 49% & 80% vs 48%); EASI-75 ( 75% vs 28% & 75% vs 26%); 4-point reduction in itch intensity on a 0-10-point scale (54% vs 12% & 61% vs 13%); clear or almost clear skin (30% vs 13% & 39% vs 10%) respectively
 Dupixent is a mAb targeting the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13 proteins, being evaluated in 8,000+ patients aged 6yrs. and older across 40+ clinical studies. The companies are helping people receiving Dupixent via DUPIXENT MyWay program","FDA approves Dupixent (dupilumab) as first biologic medicine for children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis

In the pivotal trial, more than twice as many children achieved clear or almost clear skin and more than four times achieved itch reduction with Dupixent plus topical corticosteroids (TCS) compared to TCS alone
Three-quarters of patients receiving Dupixent achieved at least a 75% improvement in overall disease, with an average improvement of approximately 80%
Safety consistent with the established safety profile of Dupixent across adult and adolescent atopic dermatitis patients
PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – May 26, 2020 – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Dupixent is the only biologic medicine approved for this patient population.

“This FDA approval is another milestone in the journey for Dupixent as an innovative biologic treatment for atopic dermatitis and other conditions driven in part by type 2 inflammation,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “Caregivers of children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and their physicians now have access to a first-in-class biologic with a proven safety profile, a factor that often plays a critical role in treatment decisions for younger patients. Additionally, improvements in itch and disease severity were observed as early as two weeks after the first dose and continued throughout active treatment, which is important for these children and their families.”

Dupixent is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signalling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) proteins, and is not an immunosuppressant. Data from Dupixent clinical trials have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). Across all approved indications globally, more than 150,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent.

“This approval brings the paradigm-changing efficacy and established safety profile of Dupixent to children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. This young, vulnerable population struggles with debilitating symptoms and disease covering over half of their body, impacting them and their families, who spend countless hours helping them manage their disease,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “We continue to study Dupixent in even younger children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from 6 months to 5 years old, as well as in children with uncontrolled, persistent asthma. Additionally, we are investigating Dupixent in other diseases driven by type 2 inflammation including eosinophilic esophagitis, food and environmental allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other dermatologic diseases.”

Dupixent continues to revolutionize the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis

The FDA evaluated the Dupixent application under Priority Review, which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions. The FDA previously granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 11 years of age not well controlled on topical prescription medications. The Breakthrough Therapy designation was created to expedite the development and review of drugs developed for serious or life-threatening conditions.

Atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, is a chronic inflammatory disease that often appears as a rash on the skin. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is characterized by rashes that can potentially cover much of the body and can include intense, persistent itching, skin lesions and skin dryness, cracking, redness or darkness, crusting and oozing. Itch is one of the most burdensome symptoms for patients and can be debilitating.

Dupixent comes in two doses, prescribed based on weight (300 mg every four weeks for children ≥15 to <30 kg and 200 mg every two weeks for children ≥30 to <60 kg, following an initial loading dose), as a pre-filled syringe for pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years.

Safety and efficacy of Dupixent across moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is consistent in patients aged 6 years and older

The FDA approval is based on data that includes pivotal Phase 3 results on the efficacy and safety of Dupixent combined with topical corticosteroids (TCS) compared to TCS alone in children with severe atopic dermatitis. In the trial, children treated with Dupixent and TCS experienced significant improvements in overall disease severity, skin clearance and itch.

Results at 16 weeks showed:

 ·84% improvement in average EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) from baseline in patients who received Dupixent every four weeks and 80% in patients who received Dupixent every two weeks, compared to 49% and 48% for TCS alone, respectively.

75% of patients who received Dupixent every four weeks and 75% of patients who received Dupixent every two weeks achieved EASI-75 (Eczema Area and Severity Index-75), compared to 28% and 26% for TCS alone, respectively.
54% of patients who received Dupixent every four weeks and 61% of patients who received Dupixent every two weeks experienced at least a 4-point reduction in itch intensity on a 0 to 10-point scale (weekly average of daily Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale), compared to 12% and 13% for TCS alone, respectively.
30% of patients who received Dupixent every four weeks and 39% of patients who received Dupixent every two weeks achieved clear or almost clear skin (Investigator’s Global Assessment or IGA), compared to 13% and 10% for TCS alone, respectively.
The safety profile of Dupixent with TCS was similar to what was observed in adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis, and consistent through 52 weeks. Safety data over the 16 week treatment period showed:

Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 65% for Dupixent every four weeks, 61% for Dupixent every two weeks and 72% and 75% for TCS alone, respectively.
AEs that were more commonly observed with Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infections (15% for Dupixent every four weeks, 9% for Dupixent every two weeks, and 8% and 12% for TCS alone, respectively), injection site reactions (10% for Dupixent every four weeks, 14% for Dupixent every two weeks, and 7% and 5% for TCS alone, respectively), nasopharyngitis (10% for Dupixent every four weeks, 3% for Dupixent every two weeks, and 3% and 10% for TCS alone, respectively), conjunctivitis (7% for Dupixent every four weeks, 9% for Dupixent every two weeks, and 3% and 5% for TCS alone), vomiting (5% for Dupixent every four weeks, 7% for Dupixent every two weeks, and 7% and 7% for TCS alone, respectively) and fever (5% for Dupixent every four weeks, 2% for Dupixent every two weeks, and 7% and 0% for TCS alone, respectively).
Additional prespecified AEs across all weight groups and doses included skin infections (6% for Dupixent every four weeks, 8% for Dupixent every two weeks, and 13% for TCS alone), which is noteworthy because patients with atopic dermatitis have an increased risk of skin infections. In adult atopic dermatitis trials, the incidence of serious skin infections was 57% less with Dupixent compared to the control groups. In addition, in the pediatric trial (6-11 years of age), herpes viral infections occurred in 0% of Dupixent patients every four weeks, 2% of Dupixent patients every two weeks, and 5% for patients on TCS alone.

Dupixent has been studied in more than 8,000 patients ages 6 years and older across more than 40 clinical trials.

Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S. and other countries to treat several diseases driven by type 2 inflammation

Dupixent is an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the pediatric (6-11 years of age) population Dupixent is given either every two weeks (200 mg) or four weeks (300 mg), based on weight, following an initial loading dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age, Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver.

 The article is being published in Nature, reports the identification and characterization of two mAb’s CA1 and CB6 from the COVID-19 recovered patients
 CA1 and CB6 mAb’s have demonstrated substantial neutralization activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 while CB6 exhibits superior neutralizing activities against the virus by 3 logs in rhesus monkeys when administered one day after infection","CB6 demonstrated prophylactic and treatment effects in rhesus monkeys 
Clinical testing expected to begin in second quarter in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company
SHANGHAI, China, May 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Junshi Biosciences (HKEX: 1877) a leading innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapies, today announced the publication of research results from the Company’s efforts to generate therapeutic COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies. The paper, titled “A human neutralizing MAb targeting the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV-2” (Shi et al. Nature), was published today in the journal Nature. Junshi and partner Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) intend to file an IND and initiate clinical trials in the U.S. and China in the second quarter of 2020.

The article reports the identification and characterization of two specific human monoclonal antibodies (CA1 and CB6) isolated from a recovered COVID-19 patient. While both antibodies demonstrated substantial neutralization activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2, CB6 exhibited superior neutralizing activities. CB6 reduced virus levels by about 3 logs in rhesus monkeys when administered one day after infection. When given one day before viral challenge, CB6 was able to keep viral load at no more than 103 RNA copies/ml, demonstrating strong prophylactic protection. Structural studies showed that CB6 recognizes epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain that overlap with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites, thereby directly obstructing virus/receptor interactions. The Fc portion of CB6 was modified to lower the risk of Fc mediated acute lung injury.

“We have successfully leveraged the Company’s years of expertise with our fully integrated R&D antibody technology platform, conducting multiple parallel development tracks of candidate antibodies that were subsequently tested in vivo infection model by the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences,” said Hui Feng, Ph.D., Junshi Biosciences’ Chief Operating Officer. “One of these candidates, described in the Nature paper, demonstrated strong neutralizing activity against COVID-19. We expect to file an IND for this candidate in the second quarter in collaboration with our partner, Lilly. As part of our effort to contribute in the fight against this global pandemic, our company has increased its research and development efforts, leveraging our strengths in the field of antibody discovery.”

“Lilly is proud to have partnered with Junshi Biosciences to develop CB6 as a potential treatment for COVID-19. The fact that CB6 can protect rhesus monkeys from COVID-19 infection suggests a potential for prophylactic use in humans,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “We are moving as quickly as possible to test such a protective effect in patients at risk for COVID-19.”

33910,Roche Initiates P-III REMDACTA Study Evaluating Actemra (tocilizumab) + Remdesivir for Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia,Roche’s OCREVUS (ocrelizumab) shorter 2-hour infusion time approved in Europe,"The P-III REMDACTA study involves assessing of Actemra + remdesivir vs PBO + remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving SOC with 1EPs & 2EPs as clinical status, mortality, mechanical ventilation & ICU variables. The study is expected to initiate the enrollment with a target of ~450 globally, including the US, Canada and EU in Jun’2020
 In addition to REMDACTA, the company has completed the enrollment in P-III COVACTA study assessing Actemra + SOC vs PBO + SOC in ~450 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia across the globe
 Genentech has also initiated P-III EMPACTA study that will focus on enrolling ~375 patients at trial sites known to provide critical care to underserved and minority populations that often do not have access to clinical trials","Reduces infusion time to 2 hours from the conventional 3.5 hours for patients with relapsing or primary progressive multiple sclerosis
EMA approval based on data from the randomised, double-blind ENSEMBLE PLUS study, showing consistent safety to the conventional OCREVUS dosing regimen
Basel, 28 May 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of a new, shorter two-hour OCREVUS® (ocrelizumab) infusion time, dosed twice yearly, for relapsing or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval is based on a positive opinion from the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

“The approval of a shorter, two-hour infusion time for OCREVUS in Europe, dosed twice yearly, will further improve the treatment experience for patients while also increasing capacity in healthcare systems,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “With more than 160,000 people treated with OCREVUS globally, a shorter infusion may assist both patients and healthcare providers to reach the ultimate goal of slowing disease progression in MS.’’

The approval is based on data from the randomised, double-blind ENSEMBLE PLUS study, which showed comparable frequency and severity of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) for a two-hour OCREVUS infusion time vs. the conventional 3.5-hour time in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (289 patients shorter infusion; 291 conventional infusion). The first dose was administered per the approved dosing schedule (two 300 mg intravenous (IV) infusions separated by two weeks) and the second or later doses (600 mg IV infusion) were administered over a shorter, two-hour time.

The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients with IRRs following the first randomised 600 mg infusion (frequency/severity assessed during and 24-hours post infusion). The frequency of IRRs was comparable between those who received the two-hour infusion (24.6%) and those who received the 3.5-hour infusion (23.1%). The majority of IRRs were mild or moderate, and more than 98% resolved in both groups without complication. No IRRs were life-threatening, serious or fatal. No patients discontinued the study due to an IRR and no new safety signals were detected.

As previously communicated, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted a supplemental Biologics License Application for a two-hour OCREVUS infusion time and is expected to make a decision by 14 December 2020.

With rapidly growing real-world experience and more than 160,000 patients treated globally, OCREVUS has twice-yearly (six-monthly) dosing and is the first and only therapy approved for RMS (including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and active, or relapsing, secondary progressive MS, in addition to clinically isolated syndrome in the U.S.) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). OCREVUS is approved in 90 countries across North America, South America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, as well as in Australia, Switzerland and the European Union.

OCREVUS is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including RRMS and active, or relapsing, SPMS, in addition to CIS in the U.S.) and PPMS. OCREVUS is a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target CD20-positive B cells, a specific type of immune cell thought to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage. This nerve cell damage can lead to disability in people with MS. Based on preclinical studies, OCREVUS binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, suggesting that important functions of the immune system may be preserved. OCREVUS is administered by intravenous infusion every six months. The initial dose is given as two 300 mg infusions given two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as single 600 mg infusions.

 Ocrevus is a mAb targeting CD20-positive B cells and is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including RRMS and active/ relapsing, SPMS, in addition to CIS in the US) and PPMS. The US FDA has accepted the sBLA for 2hrs. OCREVUS infusion time with the expected decision by Dec 14, 2020","Reduces infusion time to 2 hours from the conventional 3.5 hours for patients with relapsing or primary progressive multiple sclerosis
EMA approval based on data from the randomised, double-blind ENSEMBLE PLUS study, showing consistent safety to the conventional OCREVUS dosing regimen
Basel, 28 May 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of a new, shorter two-hour OCREVUS® (ocrelizumab) infusion time, dosed twice yearly, for relapsing or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval is based on a positive opinion from the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

“The approval of a shorter, two-hour infusion time for OCREVUS in Europe, dosed twice yearly, will further improve the treatment experience for patients while also increasing capacity in healthcare systems,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “With more than 160,000 people treated with OCREVUS globally, a shorter infusion may assist both patients and healthcare providers to reach the ultimate goal of slowing disease progression in MS.’’

The approval is based on data from the randomised, double-blind ENSEMBLE PLUS study, which showed comparable frequency and severity of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) for a two-hour OCREVUS infusion time vs. the conventional 3.5-hour time in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (289 patients shorter infusion; 291 conventional infusion). The first dose was administered per the approved dosing schedule (two 300 mg intravenous (IV) infusions separated by two weeks) and the second or later doses (600 mg IV infusion) were administered over a shorter, two-hour time.

The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients with IRRs following the first randomised 600 mg infusion (frequency/severity assessed during and 24-hours post infusion). The frequency of IRRs was comparable between those who received the two-hour infusion (24.6%) and those who received the 3.5-hour infusion (23.1%). The majority of IRRs were mild or moderate, and more than 98% resolved in both groups without complication. No IRRs were life-threatening, serious or fatal. No patients discontinued the study due to an IRR and no new safety signals were detected.

As previously communicated, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted a supplemental Biologics License Application for a two-hour OCREVUS infusion time and is expected to make a decision by 14 December 2020.

With rapidly growing real-world experience and more than 160,000 patients treated globally, OCREVUS has twice-yearly (six-monthly) dosing and is the first and only therapy approved for RMS (including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and active, or relapsing, secondary progressive MS, in addition to clinically isolated syndrome in the U.S.) and primary progressive MS (PPMS).

 ATR-002’s MOA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 viral propagation and prevents the cytokine storm as demonstrated in its preclinical studies. The dual antiviral and immunomodulatory effect allows the therapy to prevent progression to critical-stage COVID-19 in hospitalized patients
 ATR-002 is a MEK inhibitor targeting the intracellular Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and has the potential to modulate the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of the body, thus avoiding overshooting cytokine response. The company has filed respective patents with the European Patent Office","ATR-002 mode of action inhibits SARS-CoV-2 viral propagation and prevents the cytokine storm as demonstrated in preclinical studies

Atriva’s lead product candidate is the only host-targeted antiviral specifically developed to treat respiratory infections with RNA viruses, such as influenza virus and the novel SARS-CoV-2

With its dual antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, the small molecule may prevent progression to critical-stage COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and holds strong potential in the current pandemic
TÜBINGEN, Germany, May 28, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Atriva Therapeutics GmbH, a biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of host-targeting antiviral therapies, today announced a clinical strategy to treat patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 who require hospitalization. ATR-002, an oral small molecule, has been proven in preclinical trials to block viral propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and to have an immunomodulatory effect leading to a decreased cytokine and chemokine release. This dual benefit makes the MEK-inhibitor ATR-002 particularly relevant for the treatment of COVID-19.

ATR-002 has been developed specifically to treat respiratory viral infections by inhibiting MEK, a host cell factor required for the replication of various RNA viruses, including influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Preclinical studies, using virus strains from the recent German COVID-19 outbreaks, performed at the Universities of Tübingen and Münster have demonstrated that MEK inhibition by ATR-002 prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to its antiviral efficacy, ATR-002 shows a second beneficial effect: The MEK-inhibitor was able to significantly decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in cell lines, primary human cells, and an animal model of acute lung injury (ALI). Thus, ATR-002 could prevent a cytokine storm and the associated disease progression to a life-threatening condition in patients with COVID-19. Its mechanism of action with a dual benefit, antiviral activity and immunomodulation, uniquely positions ATR-002 as a promising therapeutic candidate. The Company has filed respective patents with the European Patent Office. Further, ATR-002 has successfully completed a Phase I clinical trial in 2019 where it demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers.1

“With ATR-002, we developed a small molecule to specifically address the major need for an efficient antiviral therapy for severe respiratory infections caused by RNA viruses,” said Dr. Rainer Lichtenberger, co-founder and CEO of Atriva. “ATR-002 could be a game changer in the current pandemic as we see high potential for a patient-friendly, oral medication that fundamentally impacts COVID-19 outcomes.2 To develop ATR-002 for COVID-19 is therefore a logical step in these times and possibly vital for national health systems, patients and families. Our influenza development programs will benefit strongly from synergies in clinical development and scale-up in the production of ATR-002.”

Atriva is now starting a multinational, double-blind, randomized Phase II clinical study with the oral small molecule ATR-002 to treat COVID-19 in July 2020. The trial will aim to demonstrate its efficacy against moderate COVID-19, compared to placebo, in hospitalized patients.

“The preclinical findings are very encouraging. Treating moderately to severely-sick patients aims to reduce the number of critically ill people, otherwise referred to ICUs and requiring more invasive treatment options,” said Dr. Martin Bauer, Atriva Chief Medical Officer. “From the earliest stages of development, it has been our ambition to provide a powerful antiviral to treat influenza and other severe respiratory viral infections. At this point, finding an effective therapy to treat moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 is essential for national healthcare systems as we anticipate pandemic infections to remain on the public health agenda.” With ATR-002, Atriva not only has developed an effective antiviral compound, but at the same time a defense against the overwhelming cytokine release.3

The small molecule drug can be manufactured via chemical synthesis and allows for rapid scale-up of production to meet high levels of demand. Evonik Industries AG, a German-based world leader in specialty chemicals, serves as the development and manufacturing partner to produce the ATR-002 medication for the Phase II clinical study, under its long-term collaboration with Atriva. In parallel, Atriva is preparing for the ramp-up of ATR-002 production to provide enough doses for extended clinical trials and market access following trial completion.

About ATR-002’s mode of action with dual benefit

Atriva’s lead product ATR-002, developed specifically to treat RNA virus diseases such as influenza and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, is a clinical stage MEK inhibitor drug candidate targeting the intracellular Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. This pathway is central for replication of many RNA viruses, such as the influenza virus, hantavirus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and also SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In influenza virus infected cells, the interaction of ATR-002 with MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) prevents export of the viral genome protein complexes (ribonucleoprotein, RNP) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thus blocking the formation of functional new viral particles. This ultimately reduces the viral load in the body.4

In addition, ATR-002 has the potential to modulate the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of the body, avoiding overshooting cytokine response that can be caused by such viral infections. MEK inhibition can reduce the gene expression of some of the cytokines involved, like TNF-α, IL-1ß, IP-10, IL-8, MCP-1 and MIP-1a, and thus mitigate the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients who are severely ill with influenza or COVID-19.5

 Additionally, AstraZeneca agreed to supply 400M doses to the US and UK after reaching a license agreement with Oxford University for AZD1222. The University has initiated P-II/III trial of AZD1222 in ~10,000 adult volunteers","Agreements with CEPI and Gavi and the Serum Institute of India will bring vaccine to low and middle-income countries and beyond
Global supply capacity to exceed two billion doses

AstraZeneca has taken the next steps in its commitment to broad and equitable global access to the University of Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine, following landmark agreements with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, and the Serum Institute of India (SII).

The Company today reached a $750m agreement with CEPI and Gavi to support the manufacturing, procurement and distribution of 300 million doses of the vaccine, with delivery starting by the end of the year. In addition, AstraZeneca reached a licensing agreement with SII to supply one billion doses for low and middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million before the end of 2020.

Together, the agreements mark the latest commitments to enable global access to the vaccine, including to low and middle-income countries, beyond AstraZeneca’s recent partnerships with the UK and US. The Company is building a number of supply chains in parallel across the world to support global access at no profit during the pandemic and has so far secured manufacturing capacity for two billion doses of the vaccine.

The agreement with CEPI and Gavi also represents the first advanced market commitment through the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global mechanism co-chaired by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Health Organization (WHO). The mechanism will work to ensure the fair allocation and distribution of the vaccine across the world including in low and middle-income nations. CEPI will lead development and manufacturing and Gavi will lead the procurement within the global mechanism.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “We are working tirelessly to honour our commitment to ensure broad and equitable access to Oxford’s vaccine across the globe and at no profit. Today marks an important step in helping us supply hundreds of millions of people around the world, including to those in countries with the lowest means. I am deeply grateful for everyone’s commitment to this cause and for their work in bringing this together in such a short time.”

Dr Richard Hatchett, Chief Executive Officer, CEPI, said: “AstraZeneca and our other industry partners have a critical role to play in rapidly developing safe and effective vaccines and manufacturing the billions of doses needed to put a permanent end to the COVID-19 pandemic. AstraZeneca is admirably committed to equitable global access for this vaccine, and this partnership demonstrates how the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility will bring the private, public and third sectors together to make COVID-19 vaccines available to those who need them most, for the benefit of all.”

Dr Seth Berkley, Chief Executive Officer, Gavi, said: “Today we have seen tremendous willingness from donor governments to support equitable access, particularly to developing countries – and it is incredibly heartening to see the private sector join in this effort. We encourage other vaccine manufacturers to work with us towards the shared global goal of finding solutions for this unprecedented pandemic.”

Adar Poonawalla, Chief Executive Officer, SII, said: “Serum Institute of India is delighted to partner with AstraZeneca in bringing this vaccine to India as well as low and middle-income countries. Over the past 50 years SII has built significant capability in vaccine manufacturing and supply globally. We will work closely with AstraZeneca to ensure fair and equitable distribution of the vaccine in these countries.”

AstraZeneca recently agreed to supply 400 million doses to the US and UK after reaching a licence agreement with Oxford University for its recombinant adenovirus vaccine, formerly ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and now known as AZD1222.

Oxford University recently announced the start of a Phase II/III trial of AZD1222 in about 10,000 adult volunteers. Other late-stage trials are due to begin in a number of countries. AstraZeneca recognises that the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical programme with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk.

The Company’s comprehensive pandemic response also includes rapid mobilisation of AstraZeneca’s global research efforts to discover novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies to prevent and treat progression of the COVID-19 disease, with the aim of reaching clinical trials in the next three to five months. Additionally, the Company has quickly moved into testing of new and existing medicines to treat the infection, including the CALAVI and ACCORD trials underway for Calquence(acalabrutinib) and the DARE-19 trial for Farxiga (dapagliflozin) in COVID-19 patients.


AZD1222

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, now known as AZD1222, was developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, working with the Oxford Vaccine Group. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold (adenovirus) virus that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack COVID-19 if it later infects the body.

The recombinant adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1) was chosen to generate a strong immune response from a single dose and it is not replicating, so cannot cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual. Vaccines made from the ChAdOx1 virus have been given to more than 320 people to date and have been shown to be safe and well tolerated, although they can cause temporary side effects such as a temperature, influenza-like symptoms, headache or a sore arm.

34064,Eli Lilly's Tauvid (flortaucipir F 18) Receives the US FDA's Approval as the First Drug to Image Tau Pathology in Patients Being Evaluated for Alzheimer's Disease,Lilly Receives U.S. FDA Approval of TAUVID™ (flortaucipir F 18 injection) for Use in Patients Being Evaluated for Alzheimer’s Disease,"The safety and effectiveness of Tauvid imaging is evaluated in two clinical studies. In study 1, reader interpretations of premortem TAUVID scans from 64 cognitively normal & terminally ill patients agreed to undergo Tauvid imaging and participate in a post-mortem brain donation program were compared to tau pathology at autopsy. The study met its 1EPs as with reader sensitivity ranging from 92%-100% & specificity from 52%- 92%

The study met criteria for comparison of Tauvid reads to NFT pathology, additionally, inter-reader agreement was evaluated using Fleiss’ kappa statistic and found to be 0.87 across 241 patients in Study 2
 The availability of Tauvid will initially be limited and will expand in response to commercial demand and payor reimbursement. Tauvid is the first and only approved diagnostic agent to image tau NFTs in the brain","INDIANAPOLIS, May 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — TAUVID™, a radioactive diagnostic agent, has been approved by the FDA for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate the density and distribution of aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).1 A neuropathological diagnosis of AD requires the demonstration of the presence of both beta-amyloid neuritic plaques and tau NFTs in the brain. TAUVID is the first and only approved diagnostic agent to image tau NFTs in the brain. Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY), developed TAUVID and AMYVID® (Florbetapir F 18 Injection) to provide physicians with meaningful information on the presence of both pathologies to aid the evaluation of patients suspected of having AD.1,2

“The use of diagnostic imaging can help patients and their families plan for the future and make informed choices about their health and well-being, in addition to facilitating appropriate patient management for physicians,” said Reisa Sperling, M.D., Professor of Neurology of Harvard Medical School, and Director of the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. “Determining the anatomic distribution and density of tau NFTs in the brain was previously possible only at autopsy. Now we have a way to obtain this important information in patients.”

TAUVID was evaluated in two clinical studies. In Study 1, reader interpretations of premortem TAUVID scans from 64 cognitively normal and impaired terminally ill patients who agreed to undergo TAUVID imaging and to participate in a postmortem brain donation program were compared to tau pathology at autopsy based on scoring provided by independent pathologists blinded to scan results. This study met its pre-specified success criteria, with reader sensitivity (95% CI) ranging from 92% (80, 97) to 100% (91, 100) and specificity (95% CI) from 52% (34, 70) to 92% (75, 98) in the primary efficacy cohort. In Study 2, images from the same terminally ill patients as in Study 1 (plus 18 additional terminally ill patients) and 159 patients with cognitive impairment being evaluated for AD (the indicated population) were evaluated by 5 new readers. This study also met the prespecified success criteria for comparison of TAUVID reads to NFT pathology. In addition, inter-reader agreement was evaluated using Fleiss’ kappa statistic and found to be 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.91) across 241 patients in Study 2. The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials were headache (1.4%), injection site pain (1.2%), and increased blood pressure (0.8%).1,3

“The fight against AD requires precise and reliable assessments of the two key pathologies of the disease because clinical assessments alone are limited in their ability to accurately diagnose patients,” said Mark Mintun, M.D., vice president of Lilly’s pain and neurodegeneration research and development. “History was made with the FDA approval of AMYVID to demonstrate the presence of one of those two pathologies, beta-amyloid plaques. I am excited that TAUVID has now been approved to image tau NFTs, which is the other key pathology, allowing a more comprehensive evaluation of patients. Lilly and Avid Radiopharmaceuticals are committed to bringing innovative AD diagnostics to the patients who need them most.”

Availability of TAUVID will initially be limited and will expand in response to commercial demand and payor reimbursement. Lilly remains committed to patients with cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer’s disease and to ensuring patient access to this innovative diagnostic tool. Lilly is supportive of policies that will provide access and coverage for beta-amyloid PET and tau PET imaging agents.

For more than 30 years, Lilly has been engaged in bringing innovative Alzheimer’s disease therapies and diagnostics to patients and continues to lead the field in research, which also includes identifying biomarkers to support early detection of the disease.

Indication and Important Safety Information for TAUVID

Indication
TAUVID is indicated for use with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate the density and distribution of aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Limitations of Use
TAUVID is not indicated for use in the evaluation of patients for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

Important Safety Information

Warnings and Precautions

Risk of Misdiagnosis in Patients Evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease
TAUVID does not target β-amyloid, one of two required components of the neuropathological diagnosis of AD. TAUVID performance for detecting tau pathology was assessed in terminally ill patients, the majority of whom had AD dementia with B3 level NFT pathology. TAUVID performance for detecting tau pathology may be lower in patients in earlier stages of the pathological spectrum.

Negative TAUVID Scan
NFTs may be present at levels that qualify for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD (B2 tau pathology in the presence of at least moderate levels of cortical amyloid pathology) in patients with a negative TAUVID scan. Consider additional evaluation to confirm the absence of AD pathology in patients with a negative TAUVID scan.

False Positive TAUVID Scan
Small foci of noncontiguous tracer uptake may lead to a false positive TAUVID scan. Only uptake of tracer in the neocortex should contribute to the interpretation of a positive TAUVID scan.

Risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Misdiagnosis
The safety and effectiveness of TAUVID have not been established for patients being evaluated for CTE. Preliminary non-clinical and clinical investigations suggest differences in tau conformation and distribution may limit flortaucipir F 18 binding. Therefore, TAUVID is not indicated for detection of CTE.

Radiation Risk
Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including TAUVID, expose patients to radiation. Radiation exposure is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure.

Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials were headache (1.4%), injection site pain (1.2%), and increased blood pressure (0.8%).

Indication and Important Safety Information for AMYVID
AMYVID is a radioactive diagnostic agent for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s Disease and other causes of cognitive decline. A negative AMYVID scan indicates sparse to no neuritic plaques and is inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan result reduces the likelihood that a patient’s cognitive impairment is due to Alzheimer’s Disease. A positive AMYVID scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease, but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal cognition. AMYVID is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.

Limitations of Use
A positive AMYVID scan does not establish a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease or other cognitive disorder. Additionally, the safety and effectiveness of AMYVID have not been established for predicting development of dementia or other neurologic condition, or monitoring responses to therapies.

AMYVID is supplied in 30 mL or 50 mL multidose vials containing 500-1900 MBq/mL Florbetapir F 18.

Important Safety Information

Warnings and Precautions

Risk for Image Misinterpretation and other Errors
Errors may occur in the AMYVID estimation of brain neuritic plaque density during image interpretation.

Image interpretation should be performed independently of the patient’s clinical information. The use of clinical information in the interpretation of AMYVID images has not been evaluated and may lead to errors. Other errors may be due to extensive brain atrophy that limits the ability to distinguish gray and white matter on the AMYVID scan as well as motion artifacts that distort the image.

AMYVID scan results are indicative of the brain neuritic amyloid plaque content only at the time of image acquisition and a negative scan result does not preclude the development of brain amyloid in the future.

Radiation Risk
AMYVID, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure.

Most Common Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials were headache (1.8%), musculoskeletal pain (0.7%), blood pressure increased (0.7%), nausea (0.7%), fatigue (0.5%), and injection site reaction (0.5%).

34066,Roche Reports Updated Data of Alecensa in P-III ALEX Study for Patients with ALK-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,Updated data demonstrate Roche’s Alecensa increases overall survival rate for people with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer,"The P-III ALEX study involves assessing of Alecensa vs crizotinib in 303 treatment-naïve patients in a ratio (1:1) with ALK+ NSCLC whose tumors were characterized as ALK+ by the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay
 Updated results: OS @5yrs. (62.5% vs 45.5%); reduction in the risk of death in patients with/ without CNS metastases (42%/ 24%) respectively, updated data confirms Alecensa’s safety & tolerability. The updated data follows mPFS data, presented at ESMO 2019 which demonstrated 57% reduction in risk of disease worsening or death
 Alecensa (RG7853/AF-802/RO5424802/CH5424802) is a highly selective, CNS active, oral therapy, being developed for people with ALK+ NSCLC and has received approval in 88+ countries as 1L treatment for ALK+ m-NSCLC including in the US, EU, Japan and China","Basel, 29 May 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today presented updated data from the pivotal phase III ALEX study, showing an increased five-year survival rate with Alecensa® (alectinib), compared with crizotinib, in people living with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These data confirm the longer-term efficacy of Alecensa already demonstrated across three phase III clinical trials. Full findings were presented at the ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Programme, on 29 May 2020.
“These data further support Alecensa as the standard of care for people with metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Importantly, these data show clinically meaningful benefit in people with or without central nervous system (CNS) metastases. These data, and our work in lung cancer more broadly, demonstrate our continued commitment to improving outcomes for people with this disease.”
The updated results from the ALEX study show a five-year survival rate of 62.5% (95% CI: 54.3-70.8) in the Alecensa treatment group, versus 45.5% (95% CI: 33.6-57.4) with crizotinib.1 Despite longer median treatment duration, the safety profile of Alecensa remains favourable and consistent with previous data, with no new safety signals identified.1 The overall survival (OS) data, which are not yet mature, show a benefit in patients with CNS metastases at baseline (42% reduction in the risk of death versus crizotinib (95% CI: 0.34- 1.00)), as well as in those without CNS metastases at baseline (24% reduction in the risk of death versus crizotinib (95% CI: 0.45-1.26)).1 These data follow on from the final, mature progression-free survival data from the ALEX study, presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress in September 2019, which demonstrated a reduced risk of disease worsening or death by 57% (hazard
ratio=0.43, 95% CI: 0.32–0.58) with Alecensa, versus crizotinib, in ALK-positive NSCLC.2 The updated data confirm the superior efficacy and tolerability of Alecensa in comparison to crizotinib.
Approximately 85% of lung cancer cases are NSCLC and, of these people, about 5% are ALK-positive.3,4 ALKpositive NSCLC is caused by a gene fusion or rearrangement that overactivates the ALK protein, driving cancer cell growth and survival.5 The disease often affects those who least expect it; 50% of patients are younger than 50 years and approximately 70% have never smoked.6,7,8 2/3 About the ALEX study9 ALEX (NCT02075840/B028984) is a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Alecensa versus crizotinib in treatment-naïve patients with ALK-positive NSCLC whose tumours were characterised as ALK-positive by the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay, a companion immunohistochemistry (IHC) test developed by Roche Tissue Diagnostics. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either Alecensa or crizotinib. The primary endpoint of the ALEX study was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator, and secondary endpoints included: Independent Review Committee (IRC)-assessed PFS, time to CNS progression, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and OS. The multicentre study was conducted in 303 people across 161 sites in 31 countries. OS data continue to be considered immature.

 The JHL1266 is proved to be a milestone and an initiative in bringing safe, effective, and high-quality biologics
 JHL1266 is a mAb targeting RANKL works by inhibition of developed osteoclasts and then preventing break down of bones in the human body and is targeted for osteoporosis, bone metastases, giant cell tumors of bone, and other treatment-induced bone loss","Hsinchu, Taiwan, May 18th, 2020 – JHL Biotech, Inc. today announced that the first group of subjects has been randomized and dosed last week in the company’s Australian Phase I Clinical Trial of JHL1266 in healthy subjects.

The Three-Arm Study is randomized, double-blinded, parallel-grouped, and single-dosed and will compare the pharmacokinetic similarity of JHL1266 versus Prolia® sourced from the EU and the US in healthy human subjects. It is one of the pivotal studies for registration with the ultimate objective to evaluate the similarity in Pharmacokinetics (PK), Pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity.

JHL1266, a proposed biosimilar to denosumab, is a monoclonal antibody targeting RANKL and works by inhibiting the development of osteoclasts and then preventing break down of bones in the human body. The targeted indications include the treatment of osteoporosis, bone metastases, giant cell tumors of bone, and other treatment-induced bone loss.

“Denosumab is an important biologic for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and other common bone related diseases. Because it’s unfortunately very expensive for patients and healthcare payers, JHL1266 would provide an affordable treatment for these patients,” said James Huang, CEO of JHL Biotech. “I am very proud of this achievement especially considering the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a significant milestone for JHL and a tremendous step forward in our mission to increasing public access to safe, effective, and high-quality biologics”.

34084,European Commission Waives the Takeda's Commitment to Obtain Clearance on Shire's Acquisition,European Commission Releases Takeda from Commitment to Divest Shire’s Pipeline Compound SHP647,"EC has released Takeda from the obligation to divest SHP647 & its associated rights. Takeda will discontinue the clinical study of SHP647 and will provide an opportunity to the participants to access in a PTA study
 In 2018, EC approved its proposed acquisition of Shire with a condition. To avoid overlap in IBD b/w Takeda’s Entyvio (vedolizumab) and Shire’s SHP647, Takeda committed to divest SHP647 which became effective on Jan 08, 2019
 Following the completion of the Shire acquisition, EC concluded that there is no competition concern b/w the drugs, thus Takeda’s obligation to divest SHP647 was no longer justified and the EC waived the commitment","Osaka, JAPAN, May 29, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announces that on May 28, the European Commission (the “EC”) has released Takeda from the obligation to divest the pipeline compound SHP647 and certain associated rights (“SHP647”), a commitment that was provided by Takeda to secure regulatory clearance of its acquisition of Shire plc (“Shire”). Takeda will discontinue the current SHP647 clinical trial program, and it will be providing all eligible trial participants with the opportunity to have continued access to SHP647 in a post-trial access (“PTA”) study. In addition, subject to obtaining trial participant consents and the satisfaction of regulatory and ethical considerations, Takeda will make SHP647 clinical trial data and biosamples available to the scientific community through the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation (“Foundation”).

Takeda announced on November 20, 2018, that the EC approved its proposed acquisition of Shire (the “Acquisition”). The EC’s approval was conditioned on Takeda fulfilling commitments provided to the EC in connection with the regulatory clearance. Specifically, in relation to the future potential overlap in the area of inflammatory bowel diseases between Takeda’s marketed product Entyvio (vedolizumab) and Shire’s pipeline compound SHP647, Takeda committed to divest SHP647. The divestment of SHP647 was not a condition to the completion of the Acquisition, which became effective on January 8, 2019.

Subsequent to the completion of the Shire acquisition, the SHP647 clinical trial program was affected by exceptional circumstances, which have caused the EC to conclude that the competition concerns previously identified by the EC no longer arise. Accordingly, the EC found that Takeda’s obligation to divest SHP647 was no longer justified and the EC waived the commitment.

Takeda engaged in two formal and rigorous sale processes spanning 14-months to identify and engage with potential purchasers of SHP647. The first sales process was conducted by Takeda and the second by an independent Divestiture Trustee, which was appointed under the standard procedure provided for in Takeda’s commitments to the EC. Takeda and the Divestiture Trustee each engaged with more than 60 potential purchasers, but the sale process was unsuccessful.

Takeda will no longer develop the SHP647 compound in any inflammatory bowel disease indication, including Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn’s Disease. The SHP647 clinical trial program will be discontinued in an orderly manner over the coming months. New patient enrolment into the study protocols was already stopped in late March due to the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The trials will be unblinded and not restarted. Takeda is committed to providing all eligible patients already in the SHP647 clinical trials and responding to treatment with the opportunity to have continued access to SHP647 in a PTA study. The parameters for this PTA study will be determined in collaboration with the SHP647 program’s steering committee and relevant regulatory authorities, and subsequently launched, subject to applicable local regulations and ethical considerations. Patients should continue to adhere to the current study protocol until contacted by their study site after guidance has been provided by the Takeda study team members. Treatment will be made available to patients enrolled in this PTA study to meet their individual treatment needs.

In addition, Takeda will make SHP647 clinical trial data and biosamples available to the scientific community through the Foundation, via the IBD Plexus® platform, a first-of-its-kind research information exchange platform and biobank that centralizes data and biosamples from diverse research studies, subject to applicable local regulations and ethical considerations. The Foundation will serve as an independent body to review requests from investigators and physicians seeking access to anonymised SHP647 clinical trial data and biosamples, and to make final decisions on data sharing. Takeda is committed to sharing clinical trial data and biosamples that benefit patients and foster scientific discovery in a way that ensures patient consent to the use of the data, privacy and preserves the integrity of research.

Assets and liabilities related to SHP647, which were previously classified as held for sale on Takeda’s consolidated statements of financial position, have ceased to be classified as held for sale as the result of the EC’s decision. Takeda will reverse previously estimated liabilities and reassess the estimates of the future costs related to SHP647 such as program termination costs, which will have a net impact of gain on our Operating Profit in Q1 of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2021 (i.e., FY2020). This impact will be disclosed in due course, after it becomes available.

 Truxima is a mAb approved by the US FDA and EMA and released in Latin America will affect impact on neighboring countries including Chile and Ecuador","Celltrion Healthcare launches’Truxima’ in Brazil

Direct marketing activities to expand the Latin American market

-Provincial bidding wins in three regions of Brazil… Exclusive supply of’Truxima’ in the region with successful debut

-‘Truxima launching symposium’ held… Proving high interest in’Truxima’ with participation of 500 KOL

-Direct sales of’Truxima’ in Brazil…

[2020-05-27] Celltrion Healthcare launches’Truxima’ (component name: rituximab), a biosimilar for treating blood cancer, in Brazil. As a result, the company has sold all three biosimilars such as’Ramshima’ (ingredient name: Infliximab),’Truxima’, and’Herjuma’ (ingredient name: Trastuzumab) in Brazil, the largest market in Latin America.

Celltrion Healthcare Earlier this month, Brazil 3 state one has succeeded in surpassing its competitors in bid Thank bidding held in the rituximab. The company plans to make a full-fledged expansion of the Brazilian market by exclusively selling’Truxima’ in the public markets in these regions for the next year starting from June, after the supply contracts with the relevant governments have been completed.

Celltrion HealthCare will launch the Truxima Launching Symposium for key Opinion Leader (KOL) medical personnel in the biopharmaceutical industry in Sao Paulo, Brazil on the 26th (local time) to coincide with the launch of’Truxima’. Held.

The event was held online to prevent the spread of the Corona 19 (COVID-19) virus, and over 500 medical personnel participated in the event, showing a high interest in’Truxima’. In particular, despite the fact that the symposium was targeted at KOL in Brazil, medical teams from nearby Latin American countries who learned about the event in advance also wanted to attend the symposium, and they also participated in the event, creating a place for greater information exchange. As Celltrion Healthcare confirmed the interests and needs of Latin American medical staff about’Truxima’ through the event, it plans to increase marketing activities centering on the hospitals where the participants belong.

Einstein Hospital 2 President Dr. Claudio Lottenberg, who participated as a presenter, said, “Safety and efficacy have been proven enough as’Truxima’ has been expanding its prescriptions in the United States, Europe, and around the world.” “When Truxima, a competitive company, is launched in Brazil, we expect it will be very helpful in alleviating the medical financial burden of the Brazilian government and improving patient access to medical services.”

‘Truxima’ is the only rituximab biosimilar released in Latin America and is approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Particularly, in Europe, it is a drug that has been proven to be more prescribed than original drugs, so it is expected to be active in the Latin American region, which is heavily influenced by the US and European drug markets.

Celltrion Healthcare’s Brazilian subsidiary has expanded its marketing and sales force for direct sales starting this year, and has already secured profitability by launching’Truxima’ with thorough preparation and successful bids. Celltrion Healthcare plans to expand its direct sales to other products by expanding the number of local corporations by the end of this year.

An official from Celltrion Healthcare said, “Brazil is a key country that accounts for half of the Latin American market. It is expected that the launch of’Truxima’ will have a positive impact on neighboring countries such as Chile and Ecuador. In spite of the difficult conditions that are limited, we will do our best to achieve good results in the regions of Latin America where we are planning to bid in the future because we have been able to beat competitors with the competence of pure local corporations, win the Brazilian state bid and prove our direct competitiveness. “I said.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/celltrion-5.jpg,Biosimilars,Celltrion,Truxima | rituximab,Biosimilar|Brazil|Launches|Third,publish,27/5/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/celltrion-healthcaretruxima-launched-in-brazil-direct-marketing-activities-to-expand-the-latin-american-market/,https://pharmashots.com/34090/celltrion-launches-its-third-biosimilar-truxima-biosimilar-rituximab-in-brazil/

 The P-III ANDROMEDA study resulted in meeting its 1EPs of the percentage of patients with hematologic complete response (53.3% vs 18.1%), the safety profile is in consistent with the known safety profile of the CyBorD regimen and the known safety profile of daratumumab
 In 2012, Genmab granted Janssen an exclusive WW license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize daratumumab. Janssen will discuss data with health authorities to prepare for regulatory filings","Copenhagen, Denmark; May 28, 2020 – Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) announced today positive topline results from the Phase III ANDROMEDA (AMY3001) study of subcutaneous (SC) daratumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) for patients with newly diagnosed light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. The study, conducted by Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), met the primary endpoint of percentage of patients with hematologic complete response. Patients in the study treated with daratumumab in combination with CyBorD had a 53.3% hematologic complete response compared to 18.1% of patients who were treated with CyBorD alone (odds ratio of 5.1 (95% CI 3.2 – 8.2, p<0.0001)).

Overall, the safety profile of daratumumab SC in combination with CyBorD is consistent with the known safety profile of the CyBorD regimen and the known safety profile of daratumumab.

“We are very pleased with the topline results from the Phase III ANDROMEDA study in AL amyloidosis. We believe the data supports the potential of daratumumab in the treatment of this devastating, progressive disease, for which no approved treatments are available,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab.

Janssen, which obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab from Genmab in 2012, will discuss with health authorities the potential for a regulatory submission for this indication.

About the ANDROMEDA (AMY3001) study
The Phase III study (NCT03201965) included 388 patients newly diagnosed with AL amyloidosis. Patients were randomized to receive treatment with either subcutaneous daratumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide (a chemotherapy), bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor) and dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) or treatment with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone alone. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of patients who achieve hematologic complete response.

About Light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis
Amyloidosis is a disease that occurs when amyloid proteins, which are abnormal proteins, accumulate in tissues and organs. When the amyloid proteins cluster together, they form deposits that damage the tissues and organs. AL amyloidosis most frequently affects the heart, kidneys, liver, nervous system and digestive tract. There is currently no cure or existing approved therapies for AL amyloidosis though it can be treated with chemotherapy, dexamethasone, stem cell transplants and supportive therapies.1 It is estimated that there are approximately 3,000 to 4,000 new cases of AL amyloidosis diagnosed annually in the U.S.2

DARZALEX FASPRO™ (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab, is approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma: in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for ASCT; in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for ASCT and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy; and as monotherapy, in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a PI and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.5 DARZALEX FASPRO is the first subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved in the U.S. for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

Daratumumab is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to the CD38 molecule, which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. Daratumumab triggers a person’s own immune system to attack the cancer cells, resulting in rapid tumor cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action and through immunomodulatory effects, in addition to direct tumor cell death, via apoptosis (programmed cell death).3,5,6,7,8,9

Daratumumab is being developed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. under an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab from Genmab. A comprehensive clinical development program for daratumumab is ongoing, including multiple Phase III studies in smoldering, relapsed and refractory and frontline multiple myeloma settings. Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess the potential of daratumumab in other malignant and pre-malignant diseases in which CD38 is expressed, such as amyloidosis and T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Daratumumab has received two Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA for certain indications of multiple myeloma, including as a monotherapy for heavily pretreated multiple myeloma and in combination with certain other therapies for second-line treatment of multiple myeloma.

34111,Amgen Reports Clinical Data of AMG 510 in CodeBreaK 100 Study for Multiple Solid Tumors #ASCO20,Amgen Presents New AMG 510 Clinical Data Across Multiple Solid Tumors During ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program,"The CodeBreaK 100 development program evaluates AMG 510 (proposed INN sotorasib, qd) in heavily pretreated patients with a range of KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors. Eligible patients were heavily pretreated with at least 2L+ treatment and were enrolled four dose cohorts: 180 mg/360 mg/720 mg/960 mg
 This Phase 1 dose-escalation study evaluated 42 heavily pretreated patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutant CRC. Results: 960mg cohort, ORR (12%); DCR (80%); mPFS (4.2mos.); mOS (10.1mos.); tumor shrinkage was observed in 18/39 patients with available post-baseline tumor data across all doses
 Data were evaluated for 25 heavily pretreated patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors other than CRC or NSCLC. These patients had received a median 3L+ with a median follow-up of 4.3mos. The P-II study in NSCLC is on track for data readout in 2020 while the P-II CRC trial is expected to have a data readout in early 2021","THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., May 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced new data from the CodeBreaK 100 clinical development program evaluating investigational AMG 510 (proposed INN sotorasib) in heavily pretreated patients with a range of KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors. Updated Phase 1 data from patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and other selected solid tumors continued to demonstrate disease control activity, safety and tolerability. These data are being presented during the ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program, May 29 – 31, 2020.

“Targeting KRAS has been a 40-year quest leaving patients with limited treatment options. In just under two years in the clinic, we have seen encouraging early efficacy and safety data across a number of solid tumors,” said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “New Phase 1 data at ASCO show that, in some patients with advanced colorectal cancer, sotorasib monotherapy provided prolonged disease control. A Phase 2 monotherapy study in advanced colorectal cancer has fully enrolled and will provide further insights into the potential utility of sotorasib in this disease.”

Sotorasib Activity in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer
CRC is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.1 It is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer globally and incidence is expected to grow by more than 20% over the next decade.2 For patients with previously treated metastatic CRC receiving standard therapies, unmet need remains high, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of about 2 months and response rates of less than 2%.3,4

This Phase 1 dose escalation study evaluated 42 heavily pretreated patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutant CRC (data cut-off of Jan. 2020). All patients received prior systemic therapies (median of three prior lines), with 69% having received three or more prior lines of therapy. Twenty-two (52.4%) and eight (19.0%) patients remained on treatment for more than three and six months, respectively.

In the 960 mg once-daily target dose cohort, the objective response rate (ORR) was 12% (3/25) and the disease control rate (DCR) was 80% (20/25). Median PFS was 4.2 months and overall survival (OS) had not been reached after a median follow-up of almost 8 months. Tumor shrinkage was observed in 11 of 23 patients with available post-baseline tumor data.

Across all dose levels, the majority of patients achieved disease control, with an ORR of 7.1% and a DCR of 76.2%. Disease stability was maintained for a median of 4.2 months. Median PFS was 4.0 months and median OS was 10.1 months. Tumor shrinkage was observed in 18 of 39 patients with available post-baseline tumor data across all doses.

“There is currently a tremendous treatment gap for patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutant colorectal cancer,” said Marwan G. Fakih, M.D., primary study investigator and co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program, City of Hope, Duarte, California. “These latest sotorasib data continue to show encouraging antitumor activity and tolerability in a patient population that has few treatment options.”

Disease progression was the most common reason for treatment discontinuation. The majority of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were Grade 1 and 2. Only two TRAEs were Grade 3 (diarrhea and anemia). There were no Grade 4 or higher TRAEs.

Sotorasib Activity in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Other Than NSCLC or CRC
Data were evaluated for 25 heavily pretreated patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors other than CRC or NSCLC. These patients had received a median three prior lines of therapy with a median follow-up of 4.3 months.

These data demonstrated early evidence of a consistent safety profile and anticancer activity across a range of advanced KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors, including pancreatic, appendiceal and endometrial cancer. Partial responses were confirmed in three patients with appendiceal, melanoma and endometrial cancer, respectively. Six of eight evaluable patients with pancreatic cancer achieved stable disease, and three had approximately a 30% reduction in tumor burden from baseline. Tumor shrinkage was observed in 13 of 19 evaluable patients with available post-baseline tumor data across all tumor types.

About KRAS
The subject of almost four decades of research, the RAS gene family contains the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers.5,6 Within this family, KRAS is the most prevalent variant and is particularly common in solid tumors.5 A specific mutation known as KRAS G12C is found in approximately 13% of non-small cell lung cancers, 3% to 5% of colorectal cancers and 1% to 2% of numerous other solid tumors.7-9 The KRASG12C protein has been considered “undruggable” due to a lack of traditional small molecule binding pockets on the protein. Amgen is exploring the potential of KRASG12C inhibition across a broad variety of solid tumor types.

About CodeBreaK
The CodeBreaK clinical trial program for Amgen’s investigational drug sotorasib is designed to treat patients with multiple KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers.

CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors. Eligible patients were heavily pretreated with at least two or more prior lines of treatment, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 1 study is safety, and key secondary endpoints include objective response rate (assessed every six weeks), duration of response and progression-free survival. Patients were enrolled in four dose cohorts: 180 mg, 360 mg, 720 mg and 960 mg, taken orally once a day.

Amgen’s single-arm Phase 2 trials in both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (also part of CodeBreaK 100) are now fully enrolled. The potentially registrational Phase 2 trial in NSCLC is on track for data readout in 2020. The Phase 2 CRC trial is expected to have a data readout in early 2021.

Amgen is currently enrolling six Phase 1b combination studies across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101). In addition, a randomized global Phase 3 confirmatory study in NSCLC (CodeBreaK 200) has been initiated. Additional information about CodeBreaK clinical trials can be found at http://www.codebreaktrials.com.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including Adaptive Biotechnologies (including statements regarding such collaboration’s ability to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19), BeiGene, Ltd., or the Otezla® (apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla® sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla® as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

Direct marketing activities to expand the Latin American market

-Provincial bidding wins in three regions of Brazil… Exclusive supply of’Truxima’ in the region with successful debut

-‘Truxima launching symposium’ held… Proving high interest in’Truxima’ with participation of 500 KOL

-Direct sales of’Truxima’ in Brazil…

[2020-05-27] Celltrion Healthcare launches’Truxima’ (component name: rituximab), a biosimilar for treating blood cancer, in Brazil. As a result, the company has sold all three biosimilars such as’Ramshima’ (ingredient name: Infliximab),’Truxima’, and’Herjuma’ (ingredient name: Trastuzumab) in Brazil, the largest market in Latin America.

Celltrion Healthcare Earlier this month, Brazil 3 state one has succeeded in surpassing its competitors in bid Thank bidding held in the rituximab. The company plans to make a full-fledged expansion of the Brazilian market by exclusively selling’Truxima’ in the public markets in these regions for the next year starting from June, after the supply contracts with the relevant governments have been completed.

Celltrion HealthCare will launch the Truxima Launching Symposium for key Opinion Leader (KOL) medical personnel in the biopharmaceutical industry in Sao Paulo, Brazil on the 26th (local time) to coincide with the launch of’Truxima’. Held.

The event was held online to prevent the spread of the Corona 19 (COVID-19) virus, and over 500 medical personnel participated in the event, showing a high interest in’Truxima’. In particular, despite the fact that the symposium was targeted at KOL in Brazil, medical teams from nearby Latin American countries who learned about the event in advance also wanted to attend the symposium, and they also participated in the event, creating a place for greater information exchange. As Celltrion Healthcare confirmed the interests and needs of Latin American medical staff about’Truxima’ through the event, it plans to increase marketing activities centering on the hospitals where the participants belong. 

Einstein Hospital 2 President Dr. Claudio Lottenberg, who participated as a presenter, said, “Safety and efficacy have been proven enough as’Truxima’ has been expanding its prescriptions in the United States, Europe, and around the world.” “When Truxima, a competitive company, is launched in Brazil, we expect it will be very helpful in alleviating the medical financial burden of the Brazilian government and improving patient access to medical services.”

‘Truxima’ is the only rituximab biosimilar released in Latin America and is approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Particularly, in Europe, it is a drug that has been proven to be more prescribed than original drugs, so it is expected to be active in the Latin American region, which is heavily influenced by the US and European drug markets. 

Celltrion Healthcare’s Brazilian subsidiary has expanded its marketing and sales force for direct sales starting this year, and has already secured profitability by launching’Truxima’ with thorough preparation and successful bids. Celltrion Healthcare plans to expand its direct sales to other products by expanding the number of local corporations by the end of this year.

An official from Celltrion Healthcare said, “Brazil is a key country that accounts for half of the Latin American market. It is expected that the launch of’Truxima’ will have a positive impact on neighboring countries such as Chile and Ecuador. In spite of the difficult conditions that are limited, we will do our best to achieve good results in the regions of Latin America where we are planning to bid in the future because we have been able to beat competitors with the competence of pure local corporations, win the Brazilian state bid and prove our direct competitiveness. “I said.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cellltrion.jpg,Biosimilars|Clinical Trials,Celltrion | MSD,Truxima,Gastric Cancer|Biosimilars|Clinical Trials|Advanced|First-Line|HER2-|MSD|P-I/II|PANTHERA trial|patients|Positive|Regimen|Report|results|Triplet,publish,27/5/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/celltrion-healthcaretruxima-launched-in-brazil-direct-marketing-activities-to-expand-the-latin-american-market-2/,https://pharmashots.com/34117/celltrion-and-msd-report-results-of-first-line-triplet-regimen-p-i-ii-panthera-trial-in-patients-with-her2-positive-advanced-gastric-cancer/
34120,AbbVie Signs a Worldwide License Agreement with Jacobio to Advance SHP2 Inhibitors,AbbVie and Jacobio Announce Strategic Collaboration to Advance SHP2 Inhibitors,"AbbVie to get an exclusive global license to develop and commercialize JAB-3068 and JAB-3312 from Jacobio
 AbbVie will provide undisclosed R&D cost to Jacobio for conducting early global CTs of JAB-3068 and JAB-3312. In addition, Jacobio has an exclusive option before registration trial initiation to develop and commercialize the SHP2 program in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau
 JAB-3068 and JAB-3312, are oral small molecules to inhibit SHP2 activity, a protein mediator of cellular signaling through RAS/MAP kinase pathway for the treatment of cancer","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill. and BEIJING, June 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, and Jacobio Pharmaceuticals, a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, today announced a global, strategic collaboration to develop and commercialize SHP2 inhibitors, which target a key node in cancer and immune cells.

SHP2 is an important protein mediator of cellular signaling through RAS/MAP kinase pathway. Many tumors have genetic mutations, driving abnormal cancer cell growth which relies on SHP2 activity. SHP2 also plays a key role to control cytokine production and immune cell response. Therefore, inhibition of SHP2 is believed to have dual effects by potentially reducing cancer cell growth and modulating immune responses to generate anti-tumor activities. Jacobio’s early clinical stage SHP2 assets, JAB-3068 and JAB-3312, are oral small molecules designed to specifically inhibit SHP2 activity.

“Identifying promising new targeted approaches for solid tumor patients is a high priority for us,” said Mohit Trikha, Ph.D., vice president and head, early development oncology and Bay Area site head, AbbVie. “Jacobio’s SHP2 program has the potential to treat cancer patients across many tumor types. By targeting a key node in both cancer and immune cell signaling pathways, SHP2 inhibition, both as a monotherapy and potentially in combination with other agents, may rapidly advance new treatment options for cancer patients.”

“We are excited to expand our efforts in global development of delivering breakthrough innovation to not just Chinese, but global patients with cancer,” said Yinxiang Wang, Ph.D., CEO and Chairman, Jacobio. “We look forward to a productive collaboration with AbbVie focused on rapidly advancing this novel SHP2 first-in-class therapy as a new approach for multiple cancer types. I am confident that this partnership will strengthen our R&D capabilities and ultimately bring benefits to cancer patients.”

Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie will be granted an exclusive license to the SHP2 portfolio. Jacobio will continue to conduct early global clinical trials of JAB-3068 and JAB-3312 with AbbVie covering R&D expenses. Upon completion, AbbVie will assume global development and commercialization responsibilities. Jacobio has an option, exercisable before the initiation of registrational trials, to exclusively develop and commercialize the SHP2 program in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Financial terms were not disclosed and the transaction is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

34129,Merck KGaA and Pfizer's Bavencio (avelumab) Demonstrates the Potential in Gestational Trophoblastic Tumors #ASCO20,Immunotherapy Avelumab Shows Potential in Rare Gynecologic Cancer Resistant to Chemotherapy,"The P-II study involves assessing of Bavencio in 15 women (median age 34yrs.) with GTT that are resistant to mono-CT. All patients had progressed on treatment with MTX; one patient had progressed on actinomycin-D. while patients received Bavencio until hCG levels returned to normal, followed by 3 additional cycles
 Results: 8/15 patients had no sign of disease relapse @29mos. follow-up. & hCG levels returned to normal and have been maintained, if disease has not relapsed @12mos. & monitoring of hCG has concluded, the patient is considered cured, Bavencio showed resistance in the remaining 7 patients (47%), requiring CT with actinomycin-D/ polychemotherapy with/out surgery
 The study suggested that Bavencio may work as a potential therapy for GTT patients. The study is the first study exploring use of immunotherapy in patients with GTT","ASCO Perspective 
“This study of an immunotherapy for treatment of this rare gynecologic cancer. Given the number of patients with disease that did not relapse, and reduced toxicity compared with standard single-agent chemotherapy, avelumab merits additional investigation,” said ASCO President Howard A. Burris III, MD, FACP, FASCO.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. — In a small, phase II study of a very rare cancer that develops inside a woman’s uterus during or after pregnancy, treatment with avelumab (Bavencio) potentially cured 8 out of 15 women with cancer that was resistant to single-agent chemotherapy. This is the first trial exploring use of immunotherapy in patients with gestational trophoblastic tumors (GTT) and suggests that avelumab may be a new therapeutic option for these patients. The results will be presented in the virtual scientific program of the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.

Study at a Glance

Focus First-line avelumab for treatment of gestational trophoblastic tumors (GTT)
Population 15 patients with GTT resistant to single-agent chemotherapy methotrexate or antibiotic actinomycin-D
Findings Disease did not relapse in 8 patients at 29 months follow-up and patients’ human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels returned to normal
Significance First trial of immunotherapy in GTT showing potential to cure patients with single-agent chemo-resistant disease
“This proof-of-concept study shows that treatment with the immunotherapy avelumab works against these tumors when resistance to single-agent chemotherapy develops,” said lead author Benoit You, MD, PhD, who is a medical oncologist at Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud and Lyon Investigational Center for Treatments in Oncology and Hematology in France. “Although more evidence is needed before changing clinical practice, these are highly promising results, suggesting that avelumab could prevent patients with chemo-resistant disease from the severe toxicity of chemotherapy combinations.”

GTTs are abnormal growths in the uterus that develop from placenta produced during conception. Avelumab is a checkpoint inhibitor, a type of immunotherapy that blocks a protein (PD-L1) on cancer cells that helps them hide from the body’s immune system. GTT overexpresses PD-L1, making avelumab a reasonable alternative for these tumors.

Key Findings
The majority of trophoblastic tumors relapse within 6 months, if not within the 12 months after treatment discontinuation. In this study, 8 of 15 patients (53%) with GTT that was resistant to single-agent chemotherapy methotrexate or antibiotic actinomycin-D had no sign of disease relapse at 29 months follow-up. If disease has not relapsed after 12 months and monitoring of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has concluded, researchers consider the patient cured. The hormone hCG is used as biomarker for GTT.

Seven patients achieved normal levels of hCG during treatment with avelumab, and one had normalization after discontinuation of avelumab. Disease in these patients has not relapsed after 29 months follow-up, and normal levels of hCG has been maintained. One patient who was successfully treated with avelumab later went on to have a healthy pregnancy. It was the first report of a normal pregnancy after a curative treatment with an immunotherapy agent.1

Avelumab resistance was observed in the remaining seven patients (47%), requiring chemotherapy with actinomycin-D or polychemotherapy with/without surgery.

Side effects were generally mild, with 93% of patients having grade 1-2 drug-related adverse events. Fatigue was the most common (33% of patients), followed by nausea and vomiting (33%), and infusion-related reactions (27%). “Drug tolerance was much better with avelumab than with chemotherapy,” said Dr. You.

About the Study 
This multi-site study included 15 patients (median age 34 years) with GTT that was resistant to mono-chemotherapy; 47% were stage III with metastases. All patients had progressed on treatment with methotrexate; one patient had also progressed on actinomycin-D. Patients received avelumab until hCG levels returned to normal, followed by three additional cycles.

Next Steps
The researchers are now conducting a similar trial for avelumab in the first-line setting, before resistance to therapy can develop, treating low-risk tumors with methotrexate and avelumab.

Funding
This study was funded by Merck Serono – Pfizer.

34137,Seattle Genetics Report Updated Results of Tukysa (tucatinib) in HER2CLIMB Study for Patients with HER2-Positive Breast Cancer with Stable or Active Brain Metastases #ASCO20,Seattle Genetics Announces Positive Results from Exploratory Analyses of HER2CLIMB for TUKYSA™ (tucatinib) in Brain Metastases Patients With HER2-Positive Breast Cancer,"HER2CLIMB study involves assessing of Tukysa (tucatinib) + trastuzumab + capecitabine vs trastuzumab + capecitabine alone in 612 patients in a ratio (2:1) with LA unresectable/m-HER2+ BC prior treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1
 Updated results: 42% reduction in the risk of death, 68% reduction in the risk of CNS disease; intracranial response rate (47% vs 20%); mOS (18.1 vs 12mos.); m-CNS-PFS (9.9 vs 4.2mos); DOR (6.8 vs 3.0mos.)
 The additional analyses along with the primary analysis of HER2CLIMB, shows Tukysa is active for patients with/ out a disease that has spread to the brain. Tukysa (PO) is a TKI inhibitor of HER2 that improves OS and PFS in patients with metastatic HER2+ BC with/ out brain metastases","BOTHELL, Wash.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Seattle Genetics, Inc. today announced positive results from exploratory analyses of intracranial efficacy, including survival, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who had stable or active brain metastases in the HER2CLIMB pivotal trial of TUKYSA™ (tucatinib). HER2CLIMB compared TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine to trastuzumab and capecitabine alone in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer with or without brain metastases. Of the patients enrolled in the trial, 48 percent had a presence or history of brain metastases. Results demonstrated that the addition of TUKYSA to trastuzumab and capecitabine in patients with brain metastases delayed progression in the brain, doubled the intracranial response rate (tumor shrinkage in the brain) and reduced the overall risk of death by nearly half. The data were consistent across patients who had either stable or active brain metastases. Results were presented in an oral presentation in the virtual scientific program of the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2020 for adult patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases, who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. Primary results from HER2CLIMB were first presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2019 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

“It is immensely gratifying to see for the first time, results for patients with stable or active brain metastases who are not typically included in clinical trials, especially when you consider that nearly half of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer experience disease progression to the brain,” said Nancy U. Lin, M.D., director of the Metastatic Breast Cancer Program in the Susan F. Smith Center for Women’s Cancers at Dana-Farber in Boston, MA. “These additional analyses provide further evidence that TUKYSA improves survival and delays cancer progression in the brain for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have brain metastases.”

“These additional analyses, together with the primary analysis of HER2CLIMB, show TUKYSA is active for patients with and without disease that has spread to the brain,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Seattle Genetics. “We continue to be encouraged by the remarkable clinical activity of TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine and look forward to evaluating its potential in additional treatment settings and tumor types through our ongoing clinical program.”

The new data that further examine TUKYSA’s effect in the brain include exploratory analyses for central nervous system progression-free survival (CNS-PFS), overall survival (OS), intracranial objective response rate (ORR-IC) and duration of response in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients whose disease had spread to the brain.

The exploratory analyses demonstrated that patients with brain metastases who received the TUKYSA combination versus trastuzumab and capecitabine alone had:

a 42 percent reduction in the risk of death
a 68 percent reduction in the risk of CNS disease progression (a delay in progression in the brain) or death
a more than doubling of intracranial response rate (47 percent vs. 20 percent) for patients who had active measurable intracranial lesions at baseline

In HER2CLIMB, serious adverse reactions occurred in 26 percent of patients who received TUKYSA. Serious adverse reactions occurring in 2 percent or more of patients who received TUKYSA were diarrhea (4%), vomiting (2.5%), nausea, abdominal pain, and seizure (2% each). The most common adverse reactions occurring in 20 percent or more of patients who received TUKYSA were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, vomiting, stomatitis, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, headache, anemia, and rash. Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 6 percent of patients who received TUKYSA; adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation of TUKYSA (in 1 percent or more of patients) were hepatotoxicity (1.5%) and diarrhea (1%).1

About HER2-Positive Breast Cancer

Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer have tumors with high levels of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which promotes the growth of cancer cells. An estimated 279,100 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2020.2 Between 15 and 20 percent of breast cancer cases are HER2-positive.3 Historically, HER2-positive breast cancer tends to be more aggressive and more likely to recur than HER2-negative breast cancer.3,4,5 Up to 50 percent of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer patients develop brain metastases over time. 6,7,8

About TUKYSA (tucatinib)

TUKYSA is an oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of HER2, a protein that contributes to cancer cell growth.1,9 In vitro (in lab studies), TUKYSA inhibited phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3, resulting in inhibition of downstream MAPK and AKT signaling and cell growth (proliferation), and showed anti-tumor activity in HER2-expressing tumor cells. In vivo (in living organisms), TUKYSA inhibited the growth of HER2-expressing tumors. The combination of TUKYSA and the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab showed increased anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo compared to either medicine alone.1

Important Safety Information

Warnings and Precautions

Diarrhea – TUKYSA can cause severe diarrhea including dehydration, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and death. In HER2CLIMB, 81% of patients who received TUKYSA experienced diarrhea, including 12% with Grade 3 diarrhea and 0.5% with Grade 4 diarrhea. Both patients who developed Grade 4 diarrhea subsequently died, with diarrhea as a contributor to death. The median time to onset of the first episode of diarrhea was 12 days and the median time to resolution was 8 days. Diarrhea led to dose reductions of TUKYSA in 6% of patients and discontinuation of TUKYSA in 1% of patients. Prophylactic use of antidiarrheal treatment was not required on HER2CLIMB.
If diarrhea occurs, administer antidiarrheal treatment as clinically indicated. Perform diagnostic tests as clinically indicated to exclude other causes of diarrhea. Based on the severity of the diarrhea, interrupt dose, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue TUKYSA.

Hepatotoxicity – TUKYSA can cause severe hepatotoxicity. In HER2CLIMB, 8% of patients who received TUKYSA had an ALT increase >5 × ULN, 5% had an AST increase >5 × ULN, and 1.5% had a bilirubin increase >3 × ULN (Grade ≥3). Hepatotoxicity led to dose reduction of TUKYSA in 8% of patients and discontinuation of TUKYSA in 1.5% of patients.
Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to starting TUKYSA, every 3 weeks during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of hepatoxicity, interrupt dose, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue TUKYSA.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity – TUKYSA can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential, and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential, to use effective contraception during TUKYSA treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose.
Adverse Reactions

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients who received TUKYSA. Serious adverse reactions in ≥2% of patients who received TUKYSA were diarrhea (4%), vomiting (2.5%), nausea (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and seizure (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received TUKYSA including sudden death, sepsis, dehydration, and cardiogenic shock.

Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients who received TUKYSA; those occurring in ≥1% of patients were hepatotoxicity (1.5%) and diarrhea (1%). Adverse reactions led to dose reduction in 21% of patients who received TUKYSA; those occurring in ≥2% of patients were hepatotoxicity (8%) and diarrhea (6%).

The most common adverse reactions in patients who received TUKYSA (≥20%) were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, vomiting, stomatitis, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, headache, anemia, and rash.

Lab Abnormalities

In HER2CLIMB, Grade ≥3 laboratory abnormalities reported in ≥5% of patients who received TUKYSA were: decreased phosphate, increased ALT, decreased potassium, and increased AST. The mean increase in serum creatinine was 32% within the first 21 days of treatment with TUKYSA. The serum creatinine increases persisted throughout treatment and were reversible upon treatment completion. Consider alternative markers of renal function if persistent elevations in serum creatinine are observed.

Drug Interactions

Strong CYP3A or Moderate CYP2C8 Inducers: Concomitant use may decrease TUKYSA activity. Avoid concomitant use of TUKYSA.
Strong or Moderate CYP2C8 Inhibitors: Concomitant use of TUKYSA with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor may increase the risk of TUKYSA toxicity; avoid concomitant use. Increase monitoring for TUKYSA toxicity with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors.
CYP3A Substrates: Concomitant use may increase the toxicity associated with a CYP3A substrate. Avoid concomitant use of TUKYSA where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities. If concomitant use is unavoidable, decrease the CYP3A substrate dosage.
P-gp Substrates: Concomitant use may increase the toxicity associated with a P-gp substrate. Consider reducing the dosage of P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicity.
Use in Specific Populations

Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed while taking TUKYSA and for at least 1 week after the last dose.
Renal Impairment: Use of TUKYSA in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), because capecitabine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.
Hepatic Impairment: Reduce the dose of TUKYSA for patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment.

34152,"Daewon Pharmaceutical Launches its Terrosa (biosimilar, teriparatide) to Treat Osteoporosis",Daewon Pharmaceutical Launches Terrosa in Republic of Korea,"Terrosa is a parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene recombination candidate originally developed by Richter-Helm Biotec to treat osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women including those at high risk of fracture. Additionally, Terrosa has completed its P-I and P-III trials in EU and Japan has shown an increase in bone density in the spine, femur, and hip joint
 The 4-year post marketing surveillance study is conducted as the drug is listed in equivalent biologic treatment to the reference product. The launch was successful as the patent for “stable teriparatide solution” and “increasing bone toughness and rigidity and fracture reduction method” expired in Dec 2018 and Aug 2019 respectively
 In 2017, EMA approved Terrosa and was launched in EU and the US but not as biosimilar in Aug 2019 in 2019 respectively","Daewon Pharmaceutical has launched Terrosa, a biosimilar teriparatide for osteoporosis referencing Eli Lilly’s Forsteo, on the Republic of Korea market, according to industry reports.

The launch comes after Daewon, which is based in Seoul, signed a domestic sales contract with Richter-Helm Biotec, which is a joint venture between Helm in Germany and Gedeon Richter in Hungary.

“[Terrosa] has not only proved its effectiveness and safety but also has excellent price competitiveness, which will likely reduce the burden on patients,” the company told the Korea Biomedical Review.

Terrosa is a parathyroid hormone gene recombination drug and is used in men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis as well as in women with a high risk of fractures. It functions by promoting the action of osteoblasts used in bone formation and is effective in treating osteoporosis fractures and reducing the risk of fractures.

Phase 1 and phase 3 clinical trials conducted in the European Union and Japan have shown Terrosa to aid in the formation of bone in the spine, femur, and hip joints, as well.

Although Terrosa is a bone accelerator and not a bone resorption inhibitor, it is more effective at increasing bone mass compared with existing bone resorption inhibitors. A 4-year postmarketing surveillance study will be conducted due to the drug being listed as an equivalent biologic treatment to the reference product.

According to Daewon, the Republic of Korea osteoporosis treatment market has 1 million patients and is estimated at $162.5 million in size. The injection market for osteoporosis treatment is estimated at $56 million.

The launch became a possibility after the patent for “stable teriparatide solution” expired in December 2018 and the patent for “increasing bone toughness and rigidity and fracture reduction method” expired in August 2019.

Terrosa was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2017 and launched in that market in August 2019. It was also launched on the US market in 2019, but not as a biosimilar. In both Europe and the United States, the product was launched as Terrosa.

In the United States in October, 2019, the FDA approved a teriparatide follow-on product to Forsteo. The company, Pfenex, submitted a 505(b)(2) application for approval rather than an abbreviated Biologics License Application.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Daewon.png,Biosimilars,Daewon Pharmaceutical,Terrosa | teriparatide,Osteoporosis|Biosimilar|Launches||Treat,publish,26/5/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/daewon-pharmaceutical-launches-terrosa-in-republic-of-korea/,https://pharmashots.com/34152/daewon-pharmaceutical-launches-its-terrosa-biosimilar-teriparatide-to-treat-osteoporosis/

 Results: PFS (16.5 vs 8.2mos.); @2yrs. PFS rate (48% vs 19%); ORR (43.8% vs 33.1%); CR (11.1% vs 3.9%); PR (32.7% vs 29.2%); durable responses lasting at least 2yrs. (83% vs 35%), presented on May 31, 2020 at ASCO20
 Additionally, Merck also presented data from two studies (KEYNOTE-524/Study 116 and KEYNOTE-146/Study 111) evaluating Keytruda + Lenvima in patients with unresectable HCC with no prior systemic therapy and with metastatic ccRCC who progressed following immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, respectively. The studies demonstrated a meaningful improvement in ORR","KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the first presentation of results from KEYNOTE-177, a Phase 3 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, for the first-line treatment of patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer. In this pivotal study, KEYTRUDA monotherapy significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 40% (HR=0.60 [95% CI, 0.45-0.80; p=0.0002]) and showed a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 16.5 months compared with 8.2 months for patients treated with chemotherapy (investigator’s choice of mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI, with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab), a current standard of care in this patient population. As previously announced, the study will continue without changes to evaluate overall survival (OS), the other dual primary endpoint. These results were selected for presentation on Sunday, May 31, 2020 in the plenary session of the virtual scientific program of the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (Abstract #LBA4).

“For many years, the standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with MSI-H colorectal cancer has been the combination of mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab. This is the first time a single-agent, anti-PD-1 therapy demonstrated a superior, statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy for these patients,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “There is an unmet need for new treatment options in the first-line setting that may provide sustained, long-term improvements in outcomes for patients with MSI-H colorectal cancer. We are grateful to have the opportunity to present these practice-changing findings at the plenary session of this year’s ASCO.”

“KEYTRUDA monotherapy significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 40% versus standard of care chemotherapy, with fewer treatment-related adverse events observed, in patients with MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer. KEYTRUDA also demonstrated a long-term, durable response that lasted over two years for those who responded to treatment,” said Thierry Andre, MD, professor of medical oncology, Sorbonne University, and Head of the Medical Oncology Department in St. Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris. “Data from KEYNOTE-177 show that KEYTRUDA monotherapy has the potential to become the new standard of care for first-line treatment of patients with MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer.”

In May 2017, KEYTRUDA became the first cancer therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use based on a biomarker, regardless of tumor type, in previously treated patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors.

As announced, more than 80 abstracts in nearly 20 types of solid tumors and blood cancers will be presented from Merck’s broad oncology portfolio and investigational pipeline at ASCO. A compendium of presentations and posters of Merck-led studies will be posted by Merck on Friday, May 29 at 8 a.m. ET.

KEYNOTE-177 Study Design and Additional Data (Abstract #LBA4)

KEYNOTE-177 is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA monotherapy versus standard of care chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02563002). The dual primary endpoints are PFS and OS. The study enrolled 307 patients, who were randomized to receive either KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to 35 cycles) or investigator’s choice of one of the following chemotherapy-based regimens: mFOLFOX6; mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each two-week cycle); mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab (400 mg/m2 IV, then 250 mg/m2 weekly in each two-week cycle); FOLFIRI; FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each two-week cycle); or FOLFIRI plus cetuximab (400 mg/m2 IV, then 250 mg/m2 weekly in each two-week cycle).

In this study, KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS (HR=0.60 [95% CI, 0.45-0.80; p=0.0002]) and showed a median PFS of 16.5 months compared with 8.2 months for patients treated with chemotherapy. The two-year PFS rate was 48% with KEYTRUDA versus 19% with chemotherapy. The ORR was 43.8% with KEYTRUDA versus 33.1% with chemotherapy, with a complete response observed in 11.1% and 3.9% of patients, respectively; partial responses were observed in 32.7% and 29.2% of patients, respectively. Median duration of response was not reached with KEYTRUDA (range, 2.3+ to 41.4+) versus 10.6 months with chemotherapy (range, 2.8 to 37.5+). Additionally, 83% of patients had durable responses lasting at least two years with KEYTRUDA versus 35% with chemotherapy. In the study, 59% of patients in the intent-to-treat population received subsequent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy after discontinuing study treatment in the chemotherapy arm.

The safety profile of KEYTRUDA demonstrated a lower incidence of Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) versus chemotherapy (22% versus 66%, respectively), and no new toxicities were observed. Immune-mediated AEs and infusion reactions occurred in 31% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA and 13% of patients receiving chemotherapy. The most commonly reported immune-mediated AEs were hypothyroidism (12%) and colitis (7%) with KEYTRUDA, and infusion reactions (8%) with chemotherapy.

Merck Investor Event

Merck will hold a virtual investor event in conjunction with the ASCO Annual Meeting on Tuesday, June 2 at 2 p.m. ET. Details will be provided at a date closer to the event at http://investors.merck.com/home/default.aspx.

About Microsatellite Instability High (MSI-H)

Microsatellite instability (or MSI) is defined by the National Cancer Institute as a change that occurs in the DNA of certain cells (such as tumor cells) in which the number of repeats of microsatellites (short, repeated sequences of DNA) is different from the number of repeats that was in the DNA when it was inherited. The cause of MSI may be a defect in the ability to repair mistakes made when DNA is copied in the cell. This defect is also referred to as mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR). It is estimated that approximately 5-15% of colorectal cancer patients have tumors that score as either MSI-H or dMMR when testing is performed.

About Colorectal Cancer

Colorectal cancer starts in the colon or the rectum, and these cancers are referred to as colon cancer and rectal cancer depending on where the cancer starts. Colorectal cancer often begins with growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum called polyps, which can change into cancer over time. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It is estimated there were nearly 850,000 new cases of colorectal cancer and more than 880,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2018. In the United States, it is estimated there will be nearly 105,000 new cases of colon cancer and more than 43,000 new cases of rectal cancer, resulting in more than 53,000 deaths from colorectal cancer in 2020. The five-year survival rates for advanced/metastatic colon cancer and rectal cancer (stage IV) are estimated to be 14% and 15%, respectively.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions

Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

34205,Takeda to Present Results of Iclusig (ponatinib) in P-II OPTIC Study for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in the Chronic Phase at ASCO and EHA #ASCO20,Takeda to Present Data from the ICLUSIG® (ponatinib) Clinical Trial Program that Could Prove Practice-Changing for the Treatment of Chronic-Phase CML,"The P-II OPTIC study involves assessing three initial doses of Iclusig (15/30/45 mg) in 283 patients with CML in CF, or who had documented history of the presence of the T315I mutation after receiving any number of previous TKIs
 With an average follow-up of~ 21 mos., the interim analysis showed that maximum BCR- ABL1 ≤1% in 12mos.achieved in 45mg/ day (38.7%), and responses were maintained with 15 mg / day, 75% patients with 45mg & 88% with 30mg were able to maintain BCR- ABL1 ≤1% for up to 2yrs.
 Iclusig is a kinase inhibitor directed mainly to the protein BCR-ABL1, thus inhibits the activity of BCR-ABL1 and its mutations. The company will utilize these data to file sNDA to the US FDA for the therapy","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & OSAKA, Japan–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) today announced that interim analysis data from the Phase 2 OPTIC (Optimizing Ponatinib Treatment In CML) trial will be presented during an oral session at the virtual 56th American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and the 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Meeting. The OPTIC trial is an ongoing, randomized, open-label study prospectively evaluating response-based dosing regimens of ICLUSIG® (ponatinib) over a range of three starting doses (45-, 30-, or 15-mg) with the aim of optimizing its efficacy and safety in patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) who are resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.

“ICLUSIG has been an effective treatment option for appropriate CML patients since its FDA approval in 2012”

With a median follow-up of approximately 21 months, data from the interim analysis of OPTIC show that the optimal benefit-risk profile for ICLUSIG in patients with CP-CML is achieved with a daily starting dose of 45-mg and, upon achieving ≤1% BCR-ABL1, dose reduction to 15-mg. This dosing regimen resulted in an adjudicated arterial occlusive event (AOE) rate of 5.3%.

“These data help revise our understanding of how to treat with ICLUSIG to optimize the benefit-risk in chronic-phase CML patients who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKIs – which was demonstrated in the 45-mg followed by dose reduction to 15-mg regimen – while maintaining a manageable safety profile,” said Jorge Cortes, MD, Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University, and an OPTIC trial principal investigator. “It is also important to note that clinical benefit was observed in all three starting doses in this population of patients who were resistant to multiple prior TKIs, and the majority had not demonstrated responses better than a complete hematological response to the immediate prior TKI.”

Takeda will be discussing these data with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The complete primary analysis of the OPTIC trial will be conducted and presented at a later date.

“ICLUSIG has been an effective treatment option for appropriate CML patients since its FDA approval in 2012,” said Christopher Arendt, Head, Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “These data provide additional context around the safety profile of ICLUSIG, a third-generation targeted inhibitor of BCR-ABL1, and may provide further guidance on how to reduce the risk of arterial occlusive events, a concern that we believe has limited patient access to ICLUSIG in the past. We are excited about the OPTIC findings, and we intend to submit these data to the U.S. FDA as quickly as possible as part of a supplemental New Drug Application.”

Interim Analysis (IA) of OPTIC: A Dose Ranging Study of Three Starting Doses of Ponatinib (PON).

Key findings, to be presented by Dr. Jorge Cortes, include:

By the interim analysis (IA; cutoff date of July 2019) with median follow-up time of approximately 21 months, 77% (n/N=216/282) of patients in the OPTIC trial were evaluable for the primary endpoint.
The OPTIC IA shows benefit of ponatinib in all three starting doses in a largely resistant population where the majority of patients (>60%) demonstrated a complete hematological response (CHR) or lower response to immediate prior therapy.
The maximum rates of ≤1% BCR-ABL1IS at 12 months were achieved in the 45-mg/day starting dose cohort (38.7%), and responses were maintained with the dose reduction to 15-mg/day.
With the protocol-mandated dose reduction for response in the higher dose cohorts, 75% of patients in the 45-mg cohort and 88% of patients in the 30-mg cohort were able to maintain ≤1% BCR-ABL1IS response for up to two years.
Safety data include:
As of the OPTIC IA cutoff date (July 2019), among all patients (N=282), the most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade (occurring in ≥10% of all patients) were thrombocytopenia (39.4%), neutropenia (25.2%), hypertension (24.1%), anemia (17.4%), headache (17.0%), increased lipase (16.0%), arthralgia (14.2%), constipation (12.4%), platelet count decrease (10.6%) and ALT increase (10.3%).
There was a dose-dependent trend in AOE rates:
Pre-adjudicated AOEs were reported in (45-, 30-, 15-mg/day starting dose cohorts) 8.5% (n/N = 8/94), 4.3% (n/N = 4/94), and 2.1% (n/N = 2/94).
Prospective adjudication of AOEs by independent experts resulted in (45-, 30-, 15-mg/day starting dose cohorts) 5.3% (n/N = 5/94), 4.3% (n/N = 4/94), and 1.1% (n/N = 1/94).
At the IA, there were no AOE-related deaths reported.
OPTIC Trial Design

The Phase 2 OPTIC trial is designed to prospectively evaluate response-based dosing regimens of ICLUSIG over a range of three starting doses, in patients with CP-CML resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy.
The primary endpoint is achieving ≤1% BCR-ABL1 at 12 months.
The trial enrolled 283 participants around the world, each assigned a daily starting dose of 45-mg, 30-mg or 15-mg at random. Dose reduction at response occurred per study protocol.
In addition to the OPTIC data, a poster featuring data from an independent retrospective review of AOEs in the Phase 2 PACE (Ponatinib Ph+ ALL and CML Evaluation) trial will be shared during ASCO and EHA.

About the OPTIC Trial
OPTIC (Optimizing Ponatinib Treatment In CML) is a randomized, dose-ranging trial designed to evaluate three starting doses of ICLUSIG (15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg) in patients with resistant chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) or who had documented history of presence of T315I mutation after receiving any number of prior TKIs. Dose reduction at response occurred per study protocol. The trial is expected to inform the optimal use of ICLUSIG® (ponatinib) in these patients. Approximately 283 patients were enrolled at clinical sites around the world. The primary endpoint of the trial is achieving ≤1% BCR-ABL1 at 12 months.

About the PACE Trial
The PACE (Ponatinib Ph+ ALL and CML Evaluation) trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ICLUSIG in CML and Ph+ ALL patients resistant or intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib, or with the T315I mutation. A total of 449 patients were treated with ponatinib at a starting dose of 45 mg/day. An estimated 93% of patients previously received two or more approved TKIs and 56% of all patients had received three or more approved TKIs. 55% of the overall chronic-phase CML patient population in the PACE trial achieved major cytogenetic response (MCyR) by 12 months – the primary endpoint of the PACE trial for CP-CML patients – and 70% of T315I+ CP-CML patients achieved MCyR. Enrollment in the PACE trial was completed in October 2011.

About CML and Ph+ ALL
CML – a rare malignancy – is one of four main types of leukemia; it is a result of a genetic mutation that takes place in early, immature versions of myeloid cells, which form red blood cells, platelets and most types of white blood cells. Subsequently, an abnormal gene called BCR-ABL1 forms, turning the damaged cell into a CML cell. CML typically progresses slowly, but it can change into a fast-growing acute leukemia that is hard to treat.

Ph+ ALL is a rare form of ALL that affects approximately 25% of adult ALL patients in the U.S. and is characterized by the presence of an abnormal gene, known as the Philadelphia chromosome. In patients who are Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+), an abnormal chromosome is formed when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 switch with each other. This forms a longer chromosome 9 and a shorter chromosome 22, which leads to the development of BCR-ABL1 and is associated with Ph+ ALL.

About ICLUSIG® (ponatinib) tablets
ICLUSIG is a kinase inhibitor targeting BCR-ABL1, an abnormal tyrosine kinase that is expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). ICLUSIG is a targeted cancer medicine developed using a computational and structure-based drug-design platform, specifically designed to inhibit the activity of BCR-ABL1 and its mutations. ICLUSIG inhibits native BCR-ABL1, as well as all BCR-ABL1 treatment-resistant mutations, including the most resistant T315I mutation. ICLUSIG is the only approved TKI that demonstrates activity against the T315I gatekeeper mutation of BCR-ABL1. This mutation has been associated with resistance to all other approved TKIs. ICLUSIG received full approval from the FDA in November 2016. ICLUSIG is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CP, accelerated phase, or blast phase CML or Ph+ ALL for whom no other TKI therapy is indicated, and treatment of adult patients with T315I-positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase) or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL. ICLUSIG is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION (U.S.)

WARNING: ARTERIAL OCCLUSION, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, HEART FAILURE, and HEPATOTOXICITY

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Arterial occlusion has occurred in at least 35% of ICLUSIG® (ponatinib)-treated patients including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, and the need for urgent revascularization procedures. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients less than 50 years old, experienced these events. Interrupt or stop ICLUSIG immediately for arterial occlusion. A benefit-risk consideration should guide a decision to restart ICLUSIG.
Venous Thromboembolism has occurred in 6% of ICLUSIG-treated patients. Monitor for evidence of thromboembolism. Consider dose modification or discontinuation of ICLUSIG in patients who develop serious venous thromboembolism.
Heart Failure, including fatalities occurred in 9% of ICLUSIG-treated patients. Monitor cardiac function. Interrupt or stop ICLUSIG for new or worsening heart failure.
Hepatotoxicity, liver failure and death have occurred in ICLUSIG-treated patients. Monitor hepatic function. Interrupt ICLUSIG if hepatotoxicity is suspected.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Arterial Occlusions: The 35% of patients reported to have arterial occlusive events (AOEs) in the boxed warning included patients from both phase 1 and phase 2 trials. In the phase 2 trial, 33% of ICLUSIG-treated patients experienced a cardiac vascular (21%), peripheral vascular (12%), or cerebrovascular (9%) arterial occlusive event. Some patients experienced more than 1 type of event. Fatal and life-threatening events have occurred within 2 weeks of starting treatment, with doses as low as 15 mg per day. ICLUSIG can also cause recurrent or multisite vascular occlusion. Patients have required revascularization procedures. The median time to onset of the first AOE ranged from 193-526 days. The most common risk factors observed with these events were hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and history of cardiac disease. AOEs were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with a history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia. In patients suspected of developing AOEs, interrupt or stop ICLUSIG.

Venous Thromboembolism: Venous thromboembolic events, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, superficial thrombophlebitis, and retinal vein thrombosis with vision loss, occurred in 6% of patients with an incidence rate of 5% (CP-CML), 4% (AP-CML), 10% (BP-CML), and 9% (Ph+ ALL). Consider dose modification or discontinuation of ICLUSIG in patients who develop serious venous thromboembolism.

Heart Failure: Fatal or serious heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 6% of patients in the phase 2 trial. The most common heart failure events (each 3%) were congestive cardiac failure and decreased ejection fraction. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure and treat as clinically indicated, including interruption of ICLUSIG. Consider discontinuation if serious heart failure develops.

Hepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxic events were observed in 29% of patients (11% were grade 3 or 4). Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in all disease cohorts. Three patients with BP-CML or Ph+ ALL died: one with fulminant hepatic failure within one week of starting ICLUSIG and two with acute liver failure. The most common forms were elevations of AST or ALT (54% all grades, 8% grade 3 or 4, 5% not reversed at last follow-up), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. The median time to onset of event was 3 months. Monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce or discontinue ICLUSIG as clinically indicated.

Hypertension: Treatment-emergent elevation of systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) occurred in 68% of patients, of which 12% were serious and included hypertensive crisis. Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath. In patients with baseline BP <140/90 mm Hg, 80% developed treatment-emergent hypertension (44% Stage 1 and 37% Stage 2). In 132 patients with Stage 1 hypertension at baseline, 67% developed Stage 2. Monitor and manage BP elevations during ICLUSIG use and treat hypertension to normalize BP. Interrupt, dose reduce, or stop ICLUSIG if hypertension is not medically controlled. In the event of significant worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension, interrupt treatment and consider evaluating for renal artery stenosis.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis was reported in 7% of patients (6% were serious or grade 3/4). Many of these cases resolved within 2 weeks with dose interruption or reduction of ICLUSIG. The incidence of treatment-emergent lipase elevation was 42% (16% grade 3 or greater). Check serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and monthly thereafter or as clinically indicated. Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Dose interruption or reduction may be required. In cases where lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, interrupt treatment with ICLUSIG and evaluate patients for pancreatitis. Do not consider restarting ICLUSIG until patients have complete resolution of symptoms and lipase levels are <1.5 x ULN.

Increased Toxicity in Newly Diagnosed CP-CML: In a prospective, randomized clinical trial in the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with CP-CML, ICLUSIG 45 mg once daily increased the risk of serious adverse reactions 2-fold compared to imatinib 400 mg once daily. The median exposure to treatment was less than 6 months. The trial was halted for safety in October 2013. Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions occurred at least twice as frequently in the ICLUSIG arm compared to the imatinib arm. Compared to imatinib, ICLUSIG exhibited a greater incidence of myelosuppression, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, cardiac failure, hypertension, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. ICLUSIG is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML.

Neuropathy: Overall, 20% of patients experienced a peripheral neuropathy event of any grade (2% were grade 3/4). The most common were paresthesia (5%), neuropathy peripheral (4%), hypoesthesia (3%), dysgeusia (2%), muscular weakness (2%), and hyperesthesia (1%). Cranial neuropathy developed in 2% of patients (<1% grade 3/4). Of the patients who developed neuropathy, 26% developed neuropathy during the first month of treatment. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Consider interrupting ICLUSIG and evaluate if neuropathy is suspected.

Ocular Toxicity: Serious ocular toxicities leading to blindness or blurred vision have occurred in patients. Retinal toxicities including macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal hemorrhage occurred in 2%. Conjunctival irritation, corneal erosion or abrasion, dry eye, conjunctivitis, conjunctival hemorrhage, hyperaemia and edema or eye pain occurred in 14%. Visual blurring occurred in 6%. Other ocular toxicities include cataracts, periorbital edema, blepharitis, glaucoma, eyelid edema, ocular hyperaemia, iritis, iridocyclitis, and ulcerative keratitis. Conduct comprehensive eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment.

Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage occurred in 28% of patients (6% serious, including fatalities). The incidence of serious bleeding events was higher in patients with AP- or BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were the most commonly reported serious bleeding events occurring in 1% each. Most hemorrhagic events occurred in patients with grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Interrupt ICLUSIG for serious or severe hemorrhage and evaluate.

Fluid Retention: Fluid retention occurred in 31% of patients. The most common events were peripheral edema (17%), pleural effusion (8%), pericardial effusion (4%) and peripheral swelling (3%). Serious events occurred in 4%. One instance of brain edema was fatal. Serious treatment-emergent events included: pleural effusion (2%), pericardial effusion (1%), and edema peripheral (<1%). Monitor patients for fluid retention and manage as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce, or discontinue ICLUSIG as clinically indicated.

Cardiac Arrhythmias: Arrhythmias occurred in 19% of patients (7% were grade ≥3). Arrhythmia of ventricular origin was reported in 3% of all arrhythmias, with one case being grade ≥3. Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias that led to pacemaker implantation occurred in 1% of patients. Atrial fibrillation was the most common arrhythmia (7%), approximately half of which were grade 3 or 4. Other grade 3 or 4 arrhythmia events included syncope (2%), tachycardia and bradycardia (each 0.4%), and electrocardiogram QT prolonged, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular block complete, cardio-respiratory arrest, loss of consciousness, and sinus node dysfunction (each 0.2%). For 27 patients, the event led to hospitalization. In patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness) or rapid heart rate (chest pain, palpitations or dizziness), interrupt ICLUSIG and evaluate.

Myelosuppression: Myelosuppression was reported in 59% of patients (50% were grade 3/4). The incidence of these events was greater in patients with AP- or BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL than in patients with CP-CML. Severe myelosuppression (grade 3 or 4) was observed early in treatment, with a median onset time of 1 month (range <1-40 months). Obtain complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated and adjust the dose as recommended

Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Two patients (<1%, one with AP-CML and one with BP-CML) treated with ICLUSIG developed serious tumor lysis syndrome. Hyperuricemia occurred in 7% of patients. Due to the potential for tumor lysis syndrome in patients with advanced disease, ensure adequate hydration and treat high uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with ICLUSIG.

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): Post-marketing cases of RPLS have been reported in ICLUSIG-treated patients. RPLS is a neurological disorder that can present with signs and symptoms such as seizure, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning, vision loss, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Hypertension is often present, and diagnosis is made with supportive findings on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. If RPLS is diagnosed, interrupt ICLUSIG treatment and resume treatment only once the event is resolved and if the benefit of continued treatment outweighs the risk of RPLS.

Impaired Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation: Impaired wound healing occurred in patients receiving ICLUSIG. Withhold ICLUSIG for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of ICLUSIG after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in patients receiving ICLUSIG. Permanently discontinue in patients with gastrointestinal perforation.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, ICLUSIG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of ponatinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ICLUSIG and for 3 weeks after the last dose.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most Common Adverse Reactions: The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (≥20%) were abdominal pain, rash, constipation, headache, dry skin, arterial occlusion, fatigue, hypertension, pyrexia, arthralgia, nausea, diarrhea, lipase increased, vomiting, myalgia and pain in extremity. Hematologic adverse reactions included thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concurrent use or reduce ICLUSIG dose if co-administration cannot be avoided.

Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concurrent use.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Ponatinib may impair fertility in females and it is not known if these effects are reversible. Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ICLUSIG.

Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ICLUSIG and for 6 days after last dose.

34213,AstraZeneca Reports Results of Tagrisso (osimertinib) in P-III ADAURA study for EGFR-Mutated Lung Cancer #ASCO20,Tagrisso demonstrated unprecedented disease-free survival in the adjuvant treatment of Stage IB-IIIA patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer,"The P-III ADAURA study involves assessing of Tagrisso (80 mg, qd) vs PBO in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with stage IB, II, and IIIA EGFRm NSCLC with complete tumor resection & adjuvant CT as an option across 20+ countries
 Results: in 1EPs of DFS & DFS in IIT population (83% & 79%) reduction in risk of disease recurrence or death, @2yrs. the patient remained alive & disease-free (89% vs 53%), presented at ASCO on May 31, 2020. Multiple presentations during ASCO20 showcased AstraZeneca’s leadership in lung cancer across early- and late-stage disease and reinforce the Company’s biomarker-driven approach
 Tagrisso (40 & 80mg) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against CNS metastases and has received approval as 1L treatment for EGFRm advanced NSCLC in many countries across the globe including US, EU, Japan, China","Detailed results from the Phase III ADAURA trial showed AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso (osimertinib) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage (IB, II and IIIA) epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete tumour resection with curative intent.

Results will be presented during the plenary session of the American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program on 31 May (abstract #LBA5).

In the primary endpoint of DFS in patients with Stage II and IIIA disease, adjuvant treatment (after surgery) with Tagrisso reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 83% (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12, 0.23; p<0.0001). DFS results in the overall trial population, Stage IB through IIIA, a key secondary endpoint, demonstrated a reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death of 79% (based on a HR of 0.21; 95% CI 0.16, 0.28; p<0.0001).

At two years, 89% of patients in the trial treated with Tagrisso remained alive and disease free versus 53% on placebo. Consistent DFS results were seen across all subgroups, including patients who were treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy and those who received surgery only, as well as in Asian and non-Asian patients.

Roy S. Herbst, MD, Ph.D., chief of Medical Oncology at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital, New Haven, CT and principal investigator in the Phase III ADAURA trial, said: “These data are transformative for patients with early-stage EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer who face high rates of recurrence even after successful surgery and subsequent treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy. Tagrisso will provide a much-needed new treatment option that has the potential to change the practice of medicine and improve outcomes for patients in this setting.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “The momentous results of the Phase III ADAURA trial for Tagrisso demonstrate for the first time in a global trial that an EGFR inhibitor can change the course of early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer and provide hope for a cure. We are discussing these outstanding data with regulatory authorities and look forward to bringing the benefits of Tagrisso to patients with early-stage disease.”

In April 2020, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended for the Phase III ADAURA trial to be unblinded two years early based on its determination of overwhelming efficacy. At the time of data cut-off, overall survival (OS) data favoured Tagrisso, but were not mature. The trial will continue to assess OS as a secondary endpoint.

Summary of ADAURA results

 
i The data cut-off date for DFS was 17 January 2020.

The safety and tolerability of Tagrisso in this trial was consistent with previous trials in the metastatic setting. Adverse events at Grade 3 or higher from all causes occurred in 10% of patients in the Tagrisso arm versus 3% in the placebo arm as assessed by the investigator.

Tagrisso is approved for the 1st-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many other countries around the world.

Several presentations featured during the ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program will showcase AstraZeneca’s leadership in lung cancer across early and late-stage disease and reinforce the Company’s biomarker-driven approach.

Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.1 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.2 A significant portion of patients with resectable NSCLC eventually develop recurrence despite surgery (complete resection).3,4 Approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and Europe, and 30-40% of patients in Asia have EGFRm NSCLC.5-7 These patients are particularly sensitive to treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which block the cell-signalling pathways that drive the growth of tumour cells.8 Approximately 25-30% of patients with NSCLC present with resectable disease at diagnosis.9-11

ADAURA

ADAURA is a randomised, double-blinded, global, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with Stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC with complete tumour resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated. In the experimental arm, patients were treated with Tagrisso 80mg once-daily oral tablets for three years or until disease recurrence. The trial enrolled in more than 200 centres across more than 20 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is DFS in Stage II and IIIA patients and a key secondary endpoint is DFS in Stage IB, II and IIIA patients. The data readout was originally anticipated in 2022. The trial will continue to assess OS as a secondary endpoint.

Tagrisso

Tagrisso (osimertinib) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against CNS metastases. Tagrisso 40mg and 80mg once-daily oral tablets have received approval in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many countries around the world for 1st-line EGFRm advanced NSCLC. Tagrisso is also being developed in the Stage III, unresectable setting (LAURA), in combination with chemotherapy (FLAURA2) and in combination with potential new medicines to address resistance to EGFR-TKIs (SAVANNAH, ORCHARD).

AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. AstraZeneca aims to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFRm tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with the approved medicines Iressa (gefitinib) and Tagrisso, and its ongoing Phase III trials LAURA, and FLAURA2.5-7

AstraZeneca is committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing Phase II trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD which test Tagrisso in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines. Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate is in development for metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC including trials in combination with other anticancer treatments.

An extensive late-stage Immuno-Oncology programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.12 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially curative settings (Phase III trials MERMAID-1, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. Imfinzi is also in development in the Phase II trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline including Enhertu.

AstraZeneca in Oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca’s main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.

By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

Results: ORR (45.3%); DCR (83.0%); PFS (6.9mos.); subgroup patients including patients with treated with a prior anti-HER2 regimen, ORR (43.8%) with a median treatment duration of 4.8mos.
 The ongoing P-II DESTINY-Lung01 study demonstrated that ENHERTU achieved tumor response in patients with HER2m unresectable/ mNSCLC progressed with one or more systemic therapies. Results: ORR (61.9%); DCR (90.5%); PFS (14.0 mos.)
 Both the results were presented at ASCO20. ENHERTU is a HER2-directed Ab and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated to treat patients with unresectable/ m-HER2+ breast cancer who have received 2+ prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting","WILMINGTON, Del.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Results from the ongoing Phase II DESTINY-CRC01 trial showed AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited’s (Daiichi Sankyo) ENHERTU® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in patients with HER2-positive unresectable and/or metastatic colorectal cancer who received at least two prior lines of standard treatment.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and second most common cause of cancer death globally. There are currently no medicines approved to specifically treat HER2-positive colorectal cancer, which affects approximately 2-5% of patients with colorectal cancer.

The primary endpoint of confirmed objective response rate (ORR), assessed by independent central review, showed 45.3% of patients with HER2-positive (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) advanced colorectal cancer treated with ENHERTU monotherapy (6.4mg/kg) achieved a tumor response. A disease control rate (DCR) of 83.0% was observed with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.9 months. Median duration of response (DoR) and overall survival (OS) had not yet been reached at the time of data cut-off.

Salvatore Siena, MD, Professor of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, Università degli Studi di Milano, and Niguarda Cancer Center, Milan, Italy and principal investigator of the DESTINY-CRC01 trial, said: “Understanding new ways we can treat patients with colorectal cancer, such as targeting HER2, is critical as patients have few remaining treatment options once progression occurs in the advanced disease setting. The results from DESTINY-CRC01 in patients with HER2-positive advanced disease are striking and warrant further research, especially considering many of these patients have had numerous prior therapies.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “These clinically meaningful and durable responses in patients with advanced HER2-positive colorectal cancer support our belief that HER2 is an important treatment target in this disease. ENHERTU has now demonstrated impressive clinical activity in four different cancer settings, reinforcing the potential of this remarkable medicine to transform patient outcomes across a range of HER2 targetable tumors.”

Antoine Yver, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo, said: “Metastatic colorectal cancer has a devastating prognosis and there have been limited treatment advances following progression on 1st-line treatment, and there are no therapies approved that specifically target HER2. We are encouraged by the tumor response rates seen in patients with previously treated advanced colorectal cancer and we will continue to explore the potential of ENHERTU to address this unmet medical need.”

Two exploratory cohorts enrolled patients with tumors with lower levels of HER2 expression (IHC2+/ISH- and IHC1+, respectively). There were no responses seen in these exploratory cohorts.

Prespecified exploratory analysis evaluated ORR in subgroups including patients previously treated with a prior anti-HER2 regimen (n=16). In these patients an ORR of 43.8% (95% CI, 19.8-70.1) was seen. Patients were treated with a median of four prior lines of therapy (2-11), with all patients having received prior chemotherapy treatment with irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The median treatment duration was 4.8 months (1-11). As of data cut-off on August 9, 2019, 38.5% (30 out of 78) of patients remained on treatment across all cohorts.

The overall safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY-CRC01 was consistent with that seen in previously reported ENHERTU trials. The most common Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (25.6%) and anemia (14.1%). There were five cases (6.4%) of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis determined by an independent adjudication committee. Two were Grade 2 and one was Grade 3. Two deaths (Grade 5) were determined to be due to ILD.

Results from DESTINY-CRC01 were presented during 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program on May 29-31, 2020. ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial. ENHERTU has not been approved in the United States for colorectal cancer.

FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU
ENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

Important Safety Information

WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.
Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.
Contraindications
None.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis
Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).

Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).

Neutropenia
Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.

Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.

Left Ventricular Dysfunction
Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.

Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.

Adverse Reaction
The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.

ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.

The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

Use in Specific Populations

Pregnancy: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.
Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.
Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.
Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%).
Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

NOTES TO EDITORS

Colorectal cancer
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and second most common cause of cancer death globally. Approximately 25% of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis, meaning the disease has spread to distant organs, and about 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will eventually develop metastases. Overexpression and amplification of HER2, a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors, including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, occurs in approximately 2-5% of all patients with colorectal cancer. Research indicates that HER2 amplification may be associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy and shorter survival.

DESTINY-CRC01
DESTINY-CRC01 is a global, Phase II, open-label, multi-center, trial testing the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in patients (n=78) with HER2-expressing, unresectable and/or metastatic colorectal cancer. DESTINY-CRC01 excluded patients with a mutation in the RAS or BRAF gene. The primary cohort of the trial enrolled patients (n=53) with HER2-positive disease (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+). The primary endpoint of the trial is confirmed ORR, by independent central review in the primary cohort. ORR, or tumor response rate, represents the percentage of patients whose disease decreased and/or disappears. Secondary endpoints include DCR, DoR, PFS and OS. Two additional exploratory cohorts enrolled patients whose tumors had lower levels of HER2-expression [HER2 IHC2+/ISH- (n=20) and HER2 IHC1+ (n=20), respectively].

ENHERTU
ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the US only) is a HER2-directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells.

ENHERTU Clinical Development
A comprehensive development program is underway globally with six registrational trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2-driven cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.

Collaboration between AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo

The P-I J2W-MC-PYAA study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK/PD of LY-CoV555 following a single dose administered to participants hospitalized for COVID-19
 Post-P-I results, Lilly anticipates the assessment of LY-CoV555 in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The company plans to study the drug in a preventative setting, focusing on vulnerable patient populations who are not optimal candidates for vaccines
 In the month-end, Lilly will review the results of the P-I J2W-MC-PYAA study and intend to initiate broader efficacy trials. Lilly plans to make several thousand doses of LY-CoV555 by the end of the year","INDIANAPOLIS, June 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced patients have been dosed in the world’s first study of a potential antibody treatment designed to fight COVID-19.

This investigational medicine, referred to as LY-CoV555, is the first to emerge from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in just three months after AbCellera and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) identified it from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19. LY-CoV555 is the first potential new medicine specifically designed to attack SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

The first patients in the study were dosed at major medical centers in the U.S., including NYU Grossman School of Medicine and Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.

“We are committed to working with our industry partners to generate scientific evidence to meet the urgent need for treatments that reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease,” said Mark J. Mulligan, MD, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology and director of the Vaccine Center at NYU Langone Health. “Antibody treatments like the one being studied here hold promise to be effective medical countermeasures against this deadly infection,” said Dr. Mulligan, also the Thomas S. Murphy, Sr. Professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU Langone.

“We are grateful to collaborate with colleagues at AbCellera, NIAID, and the many academic institutions who have helped us reach this milestone in humanity’s fight against COVID-19 — a disease first characterized only six months ago. We are privileged to help usher in this new era of drug development with the first potential new medicine specifically designed to attack the virus. Antibody therapies such as LY-CoV555 may have potential for both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and may be particularly important for groups hardest hit by the disease such as the elderly and those with compromised immune systems,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories.

“Later this month, we will review the results of this first human study and intend to initiate broader efficacy trials. At the same time as we are investigating safety and efficacy, we also are starting large-scale manufacturing of this potential therapy. If LY-CoV555 becomes part of the near-term solution for COVID-19, we want to be ready to deliver it to patients as quickly as possible, with the goal of having several hundred thousand doses available by the end of the year,” continued Skovronsky.

Should Phase 1 results show the antibody can be safely administered, Lilly expects to move into the next phase of testing, studying LY-CoV555 in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The company also plans to study the drug in a preventative setting, focusing on vulnerable patient populations who historically are not optimal candidates for vaccines.

Lilly is researching multiple approaches to treating COVID-19. Existing Lilly medicines are now being studied to understand their potential in treating complications of COVID-19, and the company is collaborating with two biotech companies to discover novel antibody treatments for COVID-19.

About Lilly’s SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Program
LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. Lilly intends to test this first antibody as well as other neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 over the next several months. Lilly intends to test both single antibody therapy as well as combinations of Lilly antibodies (sometimes known as antibody cocktails) as potential therapeutics for COVID-19.

About the LY-CoV555 Phase 1 Trial
Study J2W-MC-PYAA is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 1 trial that aims to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of LY-CoV555 following a single dose administered to participants hospitalized for COVID-19.

 The companies plan to initiate the clinical study in Jun’2020. The study will follow the study conducted in the US, began in Apr’2020. Earlier, the two companies collaborated to conduct P-I/IIa trials for a MERS vaccine (INO-4700/GLS-5300) developed by Inovio and GeneOne, evaluated in a clinical trial and has achieved promising results","SEOUL, South Korea and PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa., June 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — INOVIO (NASDAQ: INO), the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), and Seoul National University Hospital announced a partnership to start a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INOVIO’s COVID-19 vaccine INO-4800 in South Korea at a signing ceremony today. In attendance at the ceremony at SNU Hospital were IVI’s Director General Dr. Jerome Kim and Deputy Director General of Science Dr. Manki Song, Dr. Anh Wartel (Associate Director General of EPIC and Head of Clinical Development and Regulatory) and Dr. Daniel Chul Woo Rhee (Project Lead), and SNU Hospital’s President Yon Su Kim and Prof. Myung Don Oh.

The 2-stage trial of INO-4800, the first clinical study of COVID-19 vaccine in Korea, will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine in 40 healthy adults aged 19-50 years, and will further expand to enroll an additional 120 people aged 19-64 years.

The trial, which aims to start later in June, is funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) through INOVIO and is supported by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention/Korea National Institute of Health. In normal circumstances, it would generally take several years to start clinical trials of a new vaccine. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the trial in Korea will be conducted just two months after a similar clinical study began in the United States in early April 2020.

“We are thrilled to start the clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate in collaboration with SNU Hospitals and with support from KCDC/KNIH,” said Dr. Jerome Kim, Director General of IVI. “The trial is a crucial step in the development of an urgently needed COVID-19 vaccine. South Korea is one of the first countries in the world set to test a COVID-19 vaccine (after the U.S. China, UK, and Germany), and we are happy to collaborate with South Korean partners to accelerate clinical development of a COVID-19 vaccine through our partnership with INOVIO and CEPI.”

Prof. Myung Don Oh of SNU Hospital, who will lead the clinical trial, said “Social distancing is making life challenging in all different aspects of our society including business, education, culture, sports, and international exchange, and we have reached a point where we cannot utilize social distancing further,” adding “We have to return to normalcy and today’s launch of the vaccine clinical trial will provide significant momentum in easing fears over the pandemic and helping return to normalcy.”

Dr. J. Joseph Kim, INOVIO’s President & CEO, said, “As part of INOVIO’s global coalition of COVID-19 vaccine collaborators, funders and manufacturers we look forward with enthusiasm to advance our DNA vaccine in partnership with the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) and Seoul National University Hospital to rapidly begin clinical trials in Korea, We will soon have Phase 1 data from a US trial of INO-4800 and plan to begin Phase 2/3 trials in mid-summer. We thank IVI and SNU Hospital for their work to speed the Korea trial of INO-4800.”

The speedy regulatory approval was made possible with support from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety following its adoption in April of a fast-track approval process for clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics that are developed with a proven safety platform. Such vaccines, including DNA vaccines, can be exempt from toxicology tests leveraging the available preclinical data using the DNA platform, and expediting clinical trial review process. The DNA vaccine of US-based INOVIO to be tested was one of the first technologies to receive support from CEPI, greatly accelerating the development process of the COVID-19 vaccine.

IVI and SNU Hospitals have collaborated in the past to conduct Phase 1/2a trials for a MERS coronavirus vaccine. The MERS vaccine (INO-4700/GLS-5300) developed by INOVIO and South Korea’s GeneOne Life Science and, in trials conducted so far, has achieved promising results.

34293,Roche's Elecsys IL-6 Test Receives the US FDA's EUA to Identify Patients at High Risk of Severe Inflammatory Response with COVID-19,Roche’s Elecsys IL-6 test receives FDA Emergency Use Authorisation to help in identifying patients at high risk of severe inflammatory response,"The US FDA has issued a EUA for the Elecsys IL-6 test which measures levels of the biomarker IL-6 and can be used to identify patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease with a high risk of intubation with mechanical ventilation
 The test allows the physician to decide early if a patient with confirmed COVID-19 illness requires mechanical ventilation
 The test will be available in the countries accepting CE mark and will run on Roche’s Cobas e analyzers, widely available across the globe. These fully automated systems can provide test results in ~18 minutes, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyzer","Basel, 04 June 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for the Elecsys® IL-6 test. This test measures levels of the biomarker interleukin 6 (IL-6) and can be used to help identify patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease who could be at high risk of intubation with mechanical ventilation.

The test can support physicians, in combination with other examinations and vital signs, to decide early on if a patient with confirmed COVID-19 illness requires mechanical ventilation.“The FDA EUA approval of Elecsys IL-6 is another step in our commitment to deliver fast and reliable diagnostic tests to help fight the coronavirus pandemic,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “In the current situation, time is specifically critical. The test could help physicians in the quick identification of severe inflammatory response in patients infected with the SARS CoV-2 virus.”

“In the current pandemic, Roche’s Elecsys IL-6 test was helpful as an early indicator for acute inflammation and in the management of critically ill patients,” said Tobias Herold, MD from the Emergency Department, University Hospital, LMU University Munich, Germany. “Elevated IL-6 values help us to identify patients with a high risk of upcoming respiratory failure.

Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the Elecsys IL-6 test on Roche’s cobas e® analysers which are widely available around the world. These fully-automated systems can provide test results in approximately 18 minutes, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyser.

About Elecsys IL-6
The IL-6 immunoassay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative determination of IL-6 (interleukin-6) in human serum or plasma. This assay is used in countries accepting CE-mark to aid in the management of critically ill patients, as an early indicator for acute inflammation. Under the Emergency Use Authorisation in the US, this assay can be used to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID‑19 illness to aid in determining the risk of intubation with mechanical ventilation, in conjunction with clinical findings and the results of other laboratory testing. IL-6 is released by immune cells, once they are activated by virus, bacteria or other immune cells. IL-6 acts like a messenger to activate other immune cells to fight the infection. Because IL-6 is released so early during a severe infection, it helps physicians to identify severely ill COVID-19 patients as early as possible. Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers which are widely available around the world. These fully-automated systems can provide test results in approximately 18 minutes, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyser.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with varying developments from country to country and we are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients receive the tests, treatment and care they need.

Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 13 March we received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Our existing diagnostics portfolio for critical care has also been playing a significant role in supporting patient management during the COVID-19 crisis, with our blood gas and sepsis products being used to monitor patients in the acute setting. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

While there are currently no approved medicines for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, we are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are researching options for the future. On 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA – a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. Roche has also initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is evaluating a large number of potential collaborations.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

34295,Formycon To Update on its Biosimilar Programs,FORMYCON ANNOUNCES UPDATE ON BIOSIMILAR PROGRAMS,"Formycon signs an agreement with Bioeq AG and manufacturing partner for resubmission of BLA for FYB201 project (biosimilar, ranibizumab). Bioeq AG is in talks with the US FDA for resubmission supporting manufacturing data in the H2’20
 In Oct 2019, Formycon’s FYB202 (biosimilar, ustekinumab) has completed its P-I trial with its initiation of P-III trial in Q3’20. FYB202 is a co-developed product with Aristo Pharma and Formycon AG while Aristo holds 75.1% and Formycon AG 24.9% and Bioeq will sponsor the trial
 FYB203 (biosimilar, aflibercept) has received approval for neovascular age-related macular degeneration and is expected for P-III trial in mid-20 while Klinge Biopharma GmbH acquires the marketing rights for FYB203 from Santo Holding. Formycon’s FYB206 is in preclinical phase and its IP is established with filling of patent application","Early preventions regarding COVID-19 ensure operating schedule
Liquidity situation not affected and still solid
FDA-Resubmission of FYB201 planned for the second half of the year
FYB202 and FYB203: Clinical trial strategy unchanged
Pipeline candidate FYB206 in preclinical phase
Munich – In consideration of the current developments of the corona pandemic, Formycon AG (ISIN: DE000A1EWVY8/ WKN: A1EWVY) today announces news on its development portfolio.

An early reaction and the implementation of appropriate organizational decentralization measures enabled Formycon to adapt well to the current situation, so that the impact of the pandemic on the company’s operational development activities has been minimal so far. This also applies to the company’s liquidity situation, which is unaffected and remains very solid.

Formycon continues to work with license partner Bioeq AG and its manufacturing partner on the resubmission of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the FYB201 project, a biosimilar candidate for Lucentis(R)* (Ranibizumab), despite the situation regarding COVID-19. Together, Formycon and its partners are interacting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are currently focused on supporting the effort to generate the additional manufacturing data requested by the FDA for resubmission. Based on the manufacturing dates, completion of these efforts, and certain regulatory interactions for FYB201, a resubmission of the BLA is expected in the course of the second half of 2020 by license partner Bioeq AG.

The development project FYB202, a biosimilar candidate for Stelara(R)** (Ustekinumab), has been in phase I clinical trial since October 2019, which is at an advanced stage. Preparations for the start of the phase III clinical trial, which is scheduled for the third quarter of 2020, are continuing as planned. FYB202 is being developed in a joint venture by Aristo Pharma GmbH and Formycon AG in which Aristo Pharma GmbH holds 75.1% and Formycon AG 24.9%. Bioeq GmbH is the sponsor of the clinical trials and is also responsible for the study design and clinical operations.

Initiating work on the planned phase III clinical trial with FYB203, Formycon’s biosimilar candidate for Eylea(R)*** (Aflibercept), is also proceeding as expected. The first regulatory approvals have been granted for the randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of Aflibercept FYB203 biosimilar with the reference drug Eylea(R) in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The start of the phase III clinical trial is planned for mid-2020. The worldwide marketing rights for FYB203 have since been transferred from Santo Holding (Deutschland) GmbH within the Santo Group to Klinge Biopharma GmbH.

In addition, Formycon continues to expand its biosimilar pipeline. The development of the biosimilar candidate FYB206, for example, is currently in the preclinical phase and relevant intellectual property (IP) has already been established by filing a corresponding patent application. There have been no details on the other pipeline candidates (FYB20x) announced yet. The rights to these projects are held by Formycon.

“Formycon took early extensive measures to protect employees from infection during the corona pandemic, while at the same time ensuring the operating schedule. In addition, we are in close contact with our external partners, which have also taken intensive arrangements within the framework of the current situation to minimize the effects as far as possible,” explains Dr. Stefan Glombitza, COO of Formycon.

CEO Dr. Carsten Brockmeyer adds: “The current crisis will also impact the healthcare systems financially. The access to affordable high-quality medicines will become even more important and the need towards the use of biosimilar medicinal products is therefore expected to increase in the future.”

Formycon currently has four biosimilars in development. Based on its extensive experience in the development of biopharmaceutical drugs, the company is also working on the development of antibody-based COVID-19 compounds.

About Biosimilars:
Since their introduction in the 1980s, biopharmaceuticals have revolutionized the treatment of serious diseases such as cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and eye diseases. In the coming years, many of these biotech drugs will lose their patent protection – and by 2020, medications with revenues of approximately USD 100 billion will be off patent.

Biosimilars are follow-on versions of biopharmaceuticals, for which exclusivity has expired. They are approved via stringent regulatory pathways in highly regulated markets (such as EU, US, Japan, Canada, Australia) based on proven similarity of the biosimilar with the originator biopharmaceutical reference product. While the global market for biosimilars is currently more than USD 5.0 billion, industry experts expect this figure to grow up to USD 30 billion by the year 2025.

The company will initiate the development of the insulin biosimilar in 2020 with an aim to commercially launch the product in 2025. Companies plans to develop a pen-type injection that can be administered up to 80 units at a time in an automatic injection method considering patient convenience
 The two companies were selected for the national project where Celltrion leads development and clinical part of insulin biosimilar while Poonglim develops an Auto Pre-Filled Pen Type Injector. The national project worth 4B won for 4yrs., out of which 3B won is supported by the government
 The National Project Evaluation Committee selected the two companies by evaluating the R&D plans, submitted by companies and the project performance and capabilities. Through the implementation of the project, when the’ Localization No. 1′ product that combines quality and cost competitiveness is released in the global insulin pen-type injection market, which has been monopolized by multinational pharmaceutical companies, it received a high score that it can lower the dependence on imports for the preparation","Developed insulin pen-type injection for the first time in Korea… Selected as a national project worth 4 billion won

-Celltrion, insulin biosimilar, started development this year and aimed to launch in 2025

-Intensifying monopoly of multinational pharmaceutical companies in the global insulin pen-type injection market…Secure cost competitiveness through localization and reduce dependence on imports

[June 3, 2020] Celltrion was finally selected as a national project [1] for the development of a’customized diagnostic treatment product’, which the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology Evaluation and Management (KEIT) conspired as part of the core technology development project for the bioindustry. Miller begins to develop in earnest.

Celltrion, together with Punglim Pharmatech, a company specializing in medical devices, was selected as the final recipient of this project. Celltrion is responsible for the development and clinical of insulin formulation biosimilar, and Poonglim Pharmatech plays a role in the development of an auto pre-filled pen type injector that can be used by filling the biopharmaceuticals developed by Celltrion. Divided. The project scale is 4 billion won for 4 years, of which 3 billion won is supported by the government.

The National Project Evaluation Committee selected the two companies as the final targets by highly evaluating the R&D plan of the business plan submitted by the two companies and the project performance and capabilities. In particular, through the implementation of this project, when the’Localization No. 1’product that combines quality and cost competitiveness is released in the global insulin pen-type injection market, which has been monopolized by multinational pharmaceutical companies, it received a high score that it can lower the dependence on imports for the preparation.

Both companies intend to develop a pen-type injection that can be administered up to 80 units at a time in an automatic injection method considering patient convenience, and plan to succeed in commercialization by 2025 through four years of research and development. In this way, the first domestic insulin pen-type injections using domestic materials will be born.

Currently, 96% of the global insulin market is in an extreme monopoly state by three original companies (Sanofi, Lily and Novonodisk). There were many opinions that the domestic insulin market is highly dependent on imported products, such as Novo Nordisk occupying 45%, and localization of products is urgent.

In particular , about half of the world’s diabetic patients, estimated at about 460,300 people [2] , already use insulin pen-type injections, and this market is also growing by about 9% every year, so the market size in 2023 is at least 37 trillion won [3] ] Is expected to reach the level.

Celltrion is a pen-type that lowers unit cost and enhances patient convenience through localization in the current treatment environment, where the proportion of diabetic patients who stop injection therapy themselves is 77% due to high cost, inconvenience of administration method, and difficulty in managing needle use. It is judged that patient access to injection therapy will be improved if injection drugs are supplied.

An official from Celltrion said, “The selection of the target for this national project is the result of the recognition of the technological development innovation of both companies and the know-how and development of the market in the future.” “We expect diabetic patients to benefit from the ease-of-use injections at a lower cost.”

34314,Lilly Reveals New Data for Olumiant (baricitinib) to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus #EULAR,EULAR 2020: Lilly Shares New Data for Olumiant® in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"Lilly to present results from a long-term study that evaluated the efficacy of Olumiant (4mg, qd) in patients with mod. to sev. RA for 3yrs. of treatment. The study measured LDA as measured by SDAI ≤11, in DMARD-naïve patients and patients with an inadequate response to MTX from treatment initiation to 3yrs.
 The study found that among patients with an inadequate response to MTX, 52% of patients initially treated with Olumiant + MTX were in a state of SDAI LDA @24wks. and the rate is maintained @148wks. Lilly will also present an updated safety analysis of Olumiant in the treatment of RA utilizing data from 3,770 patients taking medicine for up to 8.4yrs.
 Additionally, Lilly will present analyses from an investigational trial evaluating Olumiant in patients with SLE at EULAR. Further, data from P-II JAHH study will be highlighted, which observed whether SLE patients experienced changes in their serum cytokine levels, following Olumiant (4mg)","INDIANAPOLIS, June 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) will present new data for Olumiant® (baricitinib) at the virtual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR 2020) taking place June 3-6, 2020. Highlights from Olumiant data being presented at the virtual meeting include new long-term data in patients living with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as well as data from an investigational trial in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

“We’re pleased to be participating in this year’s virtual EULAR meeting sharing new safety and efficacy data in people living with RA who have been treated with Olumiant,” said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. “At Lilly, our focus on patient needs doesn’t stop when we launch a product. We’re committed to continuously evaluating potential treatment options for patients living with rheumatic conditions.”

At this year’s meeting, Lilly will share results from a long-term study that evaluated the efficacy of Olumiant in patients with moderate to severe RA during three years of treatment. The study measured the achievement of clinically-relevant outcomes, including low disease activity (LDA) as measured by the simplified disease activity index (SDAI ≤11), in DMARD-naïve patients and patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX-IR) from treatment initiation to three years. Patients in this study were treated with Olumiant 4-mg once daily, an approved dose outside of North America.

The study found that among patients with an inadequate response to MTX, 52% of patients initially treated with Olumiant (+MTX) were in a state of SDAI LDA at week 24 and this rate was maintained through week 148.

Lilly will also share an updated integrated safety analysis of Olumiant in the treatment of RA using data from 3,770 patients who were treated with the medicine for up to 8.4 years. The study found that Olumiant’s safety profile remains consistent with what has been previously reported, with no increase in the rates of safety topics of interest, including serious infections, herpes zoster, major adverse cardiovascular events, deep-vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and non-NMSC malignancies. No new safety signals were identified.

“The results from Lilly’s integrated safety analysis help to further characterize the long-term safety of Olumiant as a treatment option in patients with RA,” said Kevin Winthrop, professor of medicine at the Oregon Health and Sciences University and author of the Olumiant safety abstract.

In addition, Lilly will present analyses from an investigational trial evaluating baricitinib in patients with SLE at EULAR. Data from its Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind JAHH study will be highlighted, which observed whether or not SLE patients experienced changes in their serum cytokine levels when being treated with the 4-mg dose of baricitinib.

Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients

OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS 

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:

Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to ≥5x and ≥10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse reactions (≥1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

The SPIRIT-P2 study demonstrated sustained improvement in signs and symptoms of PsA and P-III COAST-X study showed improvement in fatigue, spinal pain and stiffness @16wks.in patients with active nr-axSpA","INDIANAPOLIS, June 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Taltz® (ixekizumab) demonstrated consistent efficacy and long-term potential to help patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in new data to be presented virtually on June 5 at the European Congress of Rheumatology 2020 (EULAR).

Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) shared new results today from a subgroup analysis of the Phase 3b/4, 52-week SPIRIT-Head-to-Head (SPIRIT-H2H) study of Taltz versus Humira (adalimumab) in biologic-naïve patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). SPIRIT-H2H was the first superiority study versus Humira in PsA with a primary endpoint of simultaneous achievement of ACR50 (at least 50% improvement in disease activity as defined by the American College of Rheumatology) and PASI 100 (100% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) at Week 24.

In this prespecified analysis, efficacy outcomes through Week 52 were compared between Taltz and Humira in subgroups of patients on monotherapy, concomitant methotrexate (MTX), or concomitant MTX along with an additional conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD), including sulfasalazine, cyclosporine, or leflunomide. Results at 52 weeks showed improvements were seen with Taltz across multiple endpoints, with or without the use of MTX or other csDMARDs.

A higher proportion of patients treated with Taltz achieved Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) compared to Humira in the monotherapy subgroup (49% versus 33%), while response rates were similar between Taltz and Humira in the concomitant MTX subgroup (47% vs 47%) and concomitant csDMARD subgroup (47% vs 44%). MDA is an endpoint that includes fulfilling at least five of seven rheumatology outcome measures and is the treatment target according to multiple professional organizations.

More Taltz patients achieved the primary endpoint of simultaneous achievement of ACR50 and PASI 100 at Week 52 in all three subgroups:

Monotherapy: Taltz 38%, Humira 19%
Concomitant MTX: Taltz 39%, Humira 30%
Concomitant csDMARDS: Taltz 40%, Humira 29%
A greater proportion of patients treated with Taltz versus Humira achieved PASI 100 when used as monotherapy (66% vs 35%), in combination with MTX (63% vs 44%), or in combination with csDMARDs (64% vs 44%) and the proportion of patients achieving ACR50 was comparable between Taltz and Humira, regardless of monotherapy (51% vs 42%), concomitant MTX (48% vs 56%), or concomitant csDMARD use (49% vs 53%).

“In this subgroup analysis of the SPIRIT-H2H study, ixekizumab showed greater improvement than adalimumab across multiple PsA endpoints when taken as monotherapy, and at least comparable efficacy when used in combination with methotrexate or other csDMARDs,” said Josef Smolen, M.D., emeritus professor of medicine at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria and lead author of the abstract. “Head-to-head studies provide important insights for physicians when making treatment decisions. The results of this analysis reinforce the efficacy of ixekizumab, even as monotherapy, for patients with PsA who have had an inadequate response to csDMARDs.”

The observed safety profile for Taltz in the SPIRIT-H2H study was consistent with that reported for ixekizumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO) and PsA.

Lilly also highlighted notable results from two additional studies. The SPIRIT-P2 study demonstrated sustained improvement in signs and symptoms of PsA, as measured by ACR responses, as well as manifestations of PsA, including enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin outcomes, for up to three years in patients with prior inadequate response or intolerance to one or two tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). In the Phase 3 COAST-X study in patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), patients treated with Taltz saw improvement in fatigue, spinal pain and stiffness at Week 16. In both studies, the safety profile of Taltz was consistent with previously reported results and no unexpected safety signals were found.

“To date, Taltz has reported positive results from five H2H superiority studies across PsA and PsO, including SPIRIT-H2H, IXORA-S, UNCOVER-2, UNCOVER-3 and IXORA-R, and we’re pleased to share additional data from the SPIRIT-H2H subgroup analysis which provides further evidence for the use of Taltz as a first-line monotherapy treatment for patients living with PsA,” said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. “The full breadth of Taltz data being presented at EULAR reinforce the efficacy of Taltz in treating patients with PsA and axSpA.”

INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOR TALTZ
Taltz is approved for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation, active psoriatic arthritis, or active ankylosing spondylitis, and for the treatment of patients 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TALTZ

CONTRAINDICATIONS
Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Infections
Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of adult patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.

Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis
Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.

Hypersensitivity
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each ≤0.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Patients treated with Taltz may be at an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. In clinical trials, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group than the placebo group. During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease and if IBD occurs, discontinue Taltz and initiate appropriate medical management.

Immunizations
Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions (≥1%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profiles observed in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis were consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis in psoriatic arthritis and conjunctivitis, influenza, and urticaria in pediatric psoriasis.

Please see full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for Taltz. See Instructions for Use included with the device.

About Taltz®
Taltz is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with interleukin 17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor.1 IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Taltz inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.1

About the SPIRIT-H2H Study
SPIRIT H2H study is a Phase 3b/4, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study with blinded outcomes assessments evaluating the efficacy and safety of Taltz versus Humira in patients with PsA who are biologic DMARD-naive during a 52-week treatment period. The primary endpoint of the study was the simultaneous achievement of ACR50 and PASI 100 response at Week 24. This primary endpoint is an innovative approach that comprehensively measures clinically meaningful improvements across multiple domains of PsA. The major secondary endpoints were the demonstration of non-inferiority in ACR50 and superiority in PASI 100 at week 24. Patients with active PsA and plaque psoriasis with a body surface area involvement of at least three percent, who had inadequate response to at least one conventional DMARD, were enrolled in the study.

About the SPIRIT-P2 Study
SPIRIT-P2 is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week study followed by long term evaluation of efficacy and safety of Taltz in patients with prior inadequate response or intolerance to 1 or 2 tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). The primary endpoint of the study was percentage of patients achieving ACR20 at Week 24. The 24-week study was followed by an extension period through three years.

About Psoriatic Arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, progressive form of inflammatory arthritis that can cause swelling, stiffness and pain in and around the joints and impaired physical function.2 It occurs when an overactive immune system sends out faulty signals that cause inflammation, leading to swollen and painful joints and tendons.2 PsA can affect peripheral joints in the arms and legs (elbows, wrists, hands and feet).2 If left untreated, PsA can cause permanent joint damage. Up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop PsA.2

About the COAST-X Study
COAST-X is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Taltz for the treatment of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) in patients with objective signs of inflammation. Patients were required to have an established diagnosis of nr-axSpA and active disease defined by a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score ≥4 and total back pain ≥4 at screening and baseline, and were required to have objective signs of inflammation by presence of sacroiliitis on MRI or presence of elevated CRP.

About the Taltz Program in AxSpA
The COAST-X study is part of a clinical development program that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Taltz across various population subsets of patients with axSpA. The COAST program includes three registration studies each of one year duration: COAST-V in patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)/radiographic axSpA who are biologic-naive; COAST-W in patients with AS/radiographic axSpA who previously had an inadequate response or were intolerant to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors; and COAST-X in biologic-naive nr-axSpA patients with objective signs of inflammation. Patients may enroll into a long-term extension study (COAST-Y) after completion of any of these registration studies to receive Taltz treatment for up to an additional two years.

34329,The US FDA Extends Review of sBLA of Ofatumumab (OMB157) for Patients with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,"Novartis provides update on FDA review of ofatumumab, a self-administered, targeted B-cell therapy for patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis","Novartis reported that the US FDA has extended its review of sBLA for ofatumumab (OMB 157) to treat patients with RMS. The company anticipates the regulatory action in Sept’2020
 Novartis works with the US FDA to continue the review for ofatumumab (SC) in RMS, for the approval in the US with expected EU approval in Q2’21. In 2014, Novartis presented P-IIb results demonstrating a reduction in the number of new brain lesions in the first 24 wks. while the Novartis has initiated P-III program for ofatumumab in RMS in August 2016 
 Ofatumumab (SC, once monthly) is a CD20 mAb, targeting CD20 molecule on the B-cell surface and inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion. The therapy was originated by Genmab and licensed to GSK, later, Novartis gets rights for ofatumumab from GSK in all indications, including RMS, in Dec’2015","Basel, June 2, 2020 — Novartis today announced that it has received notice from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that the agency has extended its review of the Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for ofatumumab (OMB 157), a self-administered, targeted B-cell therapy for patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Regulatory action is now expected in September 2020.

“Novartis will continue to work with the FDA to complete the review as soon as possible,” said Marie-France Tschudin, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “We are well prepared and ready to launch ofatumumab upon approval. We are committed to the MS community and look forward to bringing this important advancement to patients with MS.”

Additional regulatory filings are currently underway and regulatory approval for ofatumumab in Europe is expected by Q2 2021.

About ofatumumab
Ofatumumab (OMB 157) is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in development for RMS that is self-adminstered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously1,2,7. As shown in preclinical studies, ofatumumab is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion3. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and may preserve the B-cells in the spleen, as shown in preclinical studies4. Once-monthly dosing of ofatumumab also allows fast repletion of B-cells and offers more flexibility5. Ofatumumab was originated by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline; Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 20156.

 The company will immediately initiate preclinical studies to select the best candidate peptides for the vaccine. Intravacc will utilize its in-house pilot-scale facility for the GMP production of the OMV-peptide vaccine and anticipates the P-I studies to be initiated in Q4’20","BILTHOVEN, Netherlands and PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island, June 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Intravacc, one of the world’s leading translational research and development vaccine institutes, with an extensive track record in developing viral and bacterial vaccines, and EpiVax, a biotechnology company based in Providence with expertise in developing vaccines and therapeutics, announce that they have entered into a collaboration agreement to further progress an novel vaccine against COVID-19, based on Intravacc’s proprietary Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMV) technology platform.

For this joint research project, Intravacc will combine its safe and immunogenic OMV delivery platform with synthetically produced COVID-19 epitopes (protein allergens), designed and optimized by EpiVax using advanced immunoinformatics tools, in order to generate a safe and highly effective T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. Pre-clinical studies will start immediately so as to select the best candidate peptides for the vaccine. Intravacc will utilize its in-house pilot-scale facility for the GMP production of the OMV-peptide vaccine, for clinical (phase I) studies expecting to start in Q4 2020.

Annie De Groot, MD, CEO and CSO of EpiVax, said:

“We are thrilled to enter into a partnership with Intravacc using their very novel ‘click-on’ OMV technology and the highly immunogenic and safe SARS-CoV-2 multi-epitope-bearing peptides designed using the iVAX toolkit at EpiVax. We believe that the combination of technologies and the strength of our longstanding collaboration with Intravacc will lead to the development of an effective and safe vaccine that could rapidly benefit hundreds of millions of people around the globe.”

Dr. Jan Groen, CEO of Intravacc, stated:

“A COVID-19 vaccine based on this approach is expected to be very safe and to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates associated with COVID-19. The vaccine is expected to lower the risk that individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 will require hospitalization and/or intensive care. It also expected to induce long-term memory responses to prevent COVID-19 disease and infection from other beta-corona viruses. We expect that leveraging Intravacc’s unique vaccine development expertise, broad-based network and successful track record in global technology transfer to vaccine manufacturers will bring success”.

About Intravacc’s OMV platform technology

For the development of vaccines against pathogens, Intravacc has designed and developed a platform based on outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) – spherical particles with intrinsic adjuvating properties. Using genetic engineering, the OMVs can be decorated with immunogenic peptides that combine T- cell epitopes that will drive effective adaptive immunity. Heterologous OMV vaccines are a suitable alternative approach to protect against pathogens that require a high level of containment, that are difficult to cultivate, or that contain viral and/or parasitic proteins. The antigens of choice are attached to the ’empty’ OMV carrier resulting in a more effective immune response.

Intravacc also has developed genetic tools to increase the yield of OMVs, to reduce toxicity, and to achieve the desired antigenic composition. Intravacc’s OMV platform is fully scalable and allows for fast and efficient modification of antigen composition, either via genetic modification of the bacterial host or by associating antigens to stockpiled carrier OMVs.

About Intravacc

The Netherlands-based Intravacc is one of the world’s leading institutes for translational vaccinology. As an established independent R&D organization with over 100 years’ experience in the development and optimization of vaccines and vaccine technologies, Intravacc has transferred its technology all over the globe, including oral polio vaccines, measles vaccines, and DPT, Hib and influenza vaccines. Intravacc offers a wide range of expertise to independently develop vaccines from lead concept to clinical phase I/II studies for partners worldwide such as academia, public health organizations (WHO, BMGF), and biotech and pharmaceutical companies.

Intravacc also has its own proprietary vaccine platform. Intravacc has established state-of-the-art research and production (GMP) facilities. Its aim is to substantially reduce development risks and costs of new vaccines in order to contribute to global health and equity in access to vaccines worldwide.

The companies will jointly research these in vivo targets, these targets may be developed by Regeneron or Intellia or co-developed under certain conditions
 As per the 2016 agreement, Intellia will receive royalties and milestones for the in vivo products it independently develops while Regeneron will get a royalty-bearing non-exclusive license to certain Intellia’s IP to develop and commercialize up to 10 ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 products in defined cell types. Additionally, the two companies will co-develop potential products for the hemophilia A and B","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTLA) announced an expansion of their existing collaboration to provide Regeneron with rights to develop products for additional in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutic targets and for the companies to jointly develop potential products for the treatment of hemophilia A and B. Regeneron also receives non-exclusive rights to independently develop and commercialize ex vivo gene edited products. Intellia will receive an upfront payment of $70 million, and Regeneron will make an additional equity investment in Intellia of $30 million at $32.42 per share.

Regeneron and Intellia have worked together to make significant advances with Intellia’s CRISPR/Cas9 platform to enable the targeted insertion of therapeutic proteins and antibodies. This collaboration expansion allows the companies to leverage more fully their jointly-developed targeted transgene insertion capabilities and potentially accelerate efforts to discover and develop new therapeutics, including products for hemophilia A and B. In preclinical studies, the companies demonstrated the first CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted transgene insertion in the liver of non-human primates, which generated normal or higher levels of circulating human Factor IX. Factor IX is a blood-clotting protein that is missing or defective in hemophilia B patients. These results suggest that transgene insertion may provide a functional Factor 9 gene, which encodes for this important protein.

“The Regeneron team works hard to push the boundaries of science and technology, and we believe the precise in vivo gene insertion capabilities jointly developed with Intellia could be a promising therapeutic platform with significant potential in many diseases, including those that have been historically difficult to treat,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron. “We’re pleased to expand our work with Intellia, a like-minded group of scientists focused on maximizing the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in order to help as many patients as possible.”

“We’re excited to work with Regeneron on what could potentially be a cure for hemophilia A and B in this expansion of our successful collaboration that builds on our leading insertion capabilities,” said Intellia’s Chief Executive Officer and President, John M. Leonard, M.D. “We believe that our CRISPR/Cas9-based technology addresses the limitations of current replacement and gene therapy approaches, and importantly, may provide a durable, potentially life-long solution to these genetic diseases.”

Under the amended agreement, the term of the companies’ existing collaboration is extended until April 2024, with Regeneron having an option to renew for an additional two years. Regeneron will have rights to discover and develop CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutic products for an additional five in vivo liver targets, for a total of up to 15 targets. As currently set forth in the existing collaboration, the parties will jointly research these in vivo targets, and thereafter certain targets may be developed by Regeneron or Intellia, or co-developed under certain conditions. Per the terms of the original agreement, Regeneron will pay potential royalties and milestone payments for the in vivo products it independently develops. In addition, Regeneron will receive a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to certain Intellia intellectual property to develop and commercialize up to 10 ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 products in defined cell types.

34348,Sanofi's Sarclisa (isatuximab) Receives EC's Approval for adults with Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma,European Commission approves Sarclisa® (isatuximab) for adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma,"EC’s approval is based on P-III ICARIA-MM study assessing Sarclisa + (pomalidomide and dexamethasone) pom-dex vs pom-dex as monothx. for patients with r/r MM, prior treated with at least two therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor with progression on the last therapy
 Results: mPFS (11.53 vs 6.47mos.); OS (60.4% vs 35.3%); In an additional analysis, the therapy showed benefits in patients with high risk cytogenetics, those aged ≥75yrs. with renal insufficiency and who were refractory to lenalidomide. The EC’s MAA for Sarclisa is applicable EU’s 27 states in addition to the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway
 Sarclisa is mAb targeting CD38 receptor on MM cells, act by inducing apoptosis & immunomodulatory activity and has received FDA’s approval on Mar 02, 2019. The company continues to evaluate Sarclisa in P-III clinical studies in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum","PARIS – June 2, 2020 – The European Commission (EC) has approved Sarclisa® (isatuximab) in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.

Sarclisa is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor of MM cells.

“The EC approval of Sarclisa represents an important additional therapeutic option and may set a new standard of care for myeloma patients in Europe who are in need of new effective treatments because their disease has returned or they have become refractory to their previous treatment,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “Sarclisa in combination with pom-dex demonstrated median progression-free survival of nearly one year, a five-month improvement over pom-dex alone, in patients who had already failed at least two prior therapies.”

Sarclisa Efficacy and Safety Profile in Difficult-to-Treat Patients 

In the Phase 3 ICARIA-MM study, Sarclisa added to pom-dex (Sarclisa combination therapy, n=154) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of progression-free survival (PFS), with a median PFS of 11.53 months compared to 6.47 months with pom-dex alone (n=153) (HR 0.596, 95% CI: 0.44-0.81, p=0.001). Sarclisa combination therapy also demonstrated a significantly greater overall response rate compared to pom-dex alone (60.4% vs. 35.3%, p<0.0001). In additional analyses, Sarclisa combination therapy compared to pom-dex alone showed a treatment benefit consistent across select subgroups reflective of real-world practice, including patients with high risk cytogenetics, those aged 75 years and older, patients with renal insufficiency and patients who were refractory to lenalidomide.

“As patients experience relapse of their multiple myeloma or become refractory to their current therapy, they become more difficult to treat with increasingly poor prognoses. In the ICARIA-MM trial, Sarclisa combination therapy showed a treatment benefit consistent across relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma subgroups,” said Philippe Moreau, M.D., Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Nantes, France. “Sarclisa offers an important new treatment option and a potentially new standard of care for these patients with relapsed, refractory disease.”

As outlined in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), the most frequent adverse reactions observed with Sarclisa (occurring in 20% or more of patients) are neutropenia (46.7%), infusion reactions (38.2%), pneumonia (30.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (28.3%), diarrhea (25.7%) and bronchitis (23.7%). The most frequent serious adverse reactions are pneumonia (9.9%) and febrile neutropenia (6.6%).

For more information on the safety of Sarclisa, please refer to the SmPC.

An Important New Option for Treating Multiple Myeloma

Sarclisa is administered by intravenous (IV) administration and is dosed at 10 mg/kg, in combination with pom-dex, every week for four weeks and then every two weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Assuming no rate adjustments based on infusion-related reactions, the first infusion takes three to four hours, the second infusion takes less than two hours, and the remaining infusions can decrease to 75 minutes from the third infusion onwards. A treatment cycle is 28 days. The EC marketing authorization for Sarclisa is applicable to the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), plus the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

Multiple Myeloma: A Significant Burden to Patients

MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy,1 with more than 138,000 new cases worldwide each year.2 In Europe, approximately 40,000 patients are diagnosed with MM yearly.3 MM remains incurable in the vast majority of patients, resulting in significant disease burden.

About Sarclisa

Sarclisa is a mAb that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on MM cells, making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. It is designed to induce programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity.

In addition to the EU, Sarclisa has also been approved in the U.S., Switzerland, Canada and Australia in combination with pom-dex for the treatment of certain adults with relapsed refractory MM. In the U.S., the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The safety and efficacy of these additional uses have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority worldwide.

34353,Roche's Tecentriq + Avastin Receives the US FDA's Approval for Unresectable or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma,FDA approves Roche’s Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for people with the most common form of liver cancer,"The approval is based on P-III IMbrave150 study assessing Tecentriq (IV, 1200mg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle) and Avastin (IV, 15 mg/kg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle) vs sorafenib (400mg bid, on days 1-21 of each 21-day cycle) in 501 people in a ratio (2:1) with unresectable/ metastatic HCC prior not treated with systemic therapy
 Results: 42% reduction in risk of death, 41% reduction in disease worsening, results were published in NEJM on May 14, 2020. The US FDA has approved the application under Project Orbis initiative and Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program helping to bring the new treatment option rapidly to patients in the US and ROW
 Roche has an extensive development program for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies for lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both as monothx. and in combination with other therapies","Basel, 2 June 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with Avastin® (bevacizumab) for the treatment of people with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy.

“We’re excited that today’s approval of Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma brings a cancer immunotherapy option to people with this aggressive form of liver cancer,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “The application was reviewed under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review pilot and Project Orbis initiative, helping to bring this new treatment option rapidly to patients in the United States and around the world.”

“The results of the IMbrave150 study are really transformative for patients with advanced liver cancer, one of the few cancers with a rising death rate and limited options in the first-line setting,” said Dr Richard Finn, Professor of Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and Director of the Signal Transduction and Therapeutics Program at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. “For the first-time we have a regimen that markedly improves survival over sorafenib, the standard of care for first-line hepatocellular carcinoma since 2007, and offers patients the opportunity for improved disease control with a favourable tolerability profile.”

The review of this application was conducted under the FDA’s Project Orbis initiative, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among international partners. According to the FDA, collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions.1 Simultaneous applications were submitted to regulators in the United States, Australia, Canada and Singapore under Project Orbis. Additionally, the FDA rapidly reviewed and approved the application under its Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot programme, which aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible.

The approval was based on results from the Phase III IMbrave150 study, which demonstrated that Tecentriq in combination with Avastin reduced the risk of death (overall survival; OS) by 42% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.58; 95% CI: 0.42-0.79; p=0.0006) and reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival; PFS) by 41% (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.47-0.76; p<0.0001), compared with sorafenib. IMbrave150 is the first Phase III cancer immunotherapy study to show an improvement in OS and PFS in people with unresectable or metastatic HCC compared with sorafenib. Serious adverse reactions (Grade 3-4) occurred in 38% of people in the Tecentriq and Avastin arm. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, infections and fever. These results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 14 May 2020.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMbrave150 study
IMbrave150 is a global Phase III, multicentre, open-label study of 501 people with unresectable or metastatic HCC who had not received prior systemic therapy. People were randomised 2:1 to receive the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin or sorafenib. Tecentriq was administered intravenously (IV), 1200 mg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, and Avastin was administered IV, 15 mg/kg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Sorafenib was administered by mouth, 400 mg twice per day, on days 1-21 of each 21-day cycle. People received the combination or the control arm treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The two primary endpoints were OS and independent review facility (IRF)-assessed PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Additional study endpoints were IRF-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST and mRECIST.

About hepatocellular carcinoma
HCC is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options and is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide.2 Every year, more than 750,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with HCC,2,3 with the majority of cases in Asia and almost half of all cases in China.3,4 In the US, the number of liver cancer cases have more than tripled since 1980 and HCC represents the fastest-rising cause of cancer-related death, while in Europe, liver cancer is also on the rise.5-7 HCC develops predominantly in people with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis (B or C) or alcohol consumption, and typically presents at an advanced stage.2 The prognosis for unresectable HCC remains poor, with few systemic therapeutic options and a 1-year survival rate of less than 50% following diagnosis.8

About the Tecentriq and Avastin combination
There is a strong scientific rationale to support the use of Tecentriq plus Avastin in combination. The Tecentriq and Avastin regimen may enhance the potential of the immune system to combat a broad range of cancers. Avastin, in addition to its established anti-angiogenic effects, may further enhance Tecentriq’s ability to restore anti-cancer immunity, by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related immunosuppression, promoting T-cell tumour infiltration and enabling priming and activation of T-cell responses against tumour antigens.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for people with unresectable or metastatic HCC.

About Avastin
Avastin is a prescription-only medicine that is a solution for intravenous infusion. It is a biologic antibody designed to specifically bind to a protein called VEGF that plays an important role throughout the lifecycle of the tumour to develop and maintain blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Avastin is designed to interfere with the tumour blood supply by directly binding to the VEGF protein to prevent interactions with receptors on blood vessel cells. The tumour blood supply is thought to be critical to a tumour’s ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasise).

34356,Revance and Mylan to Advance Development Program for a Proposed Biosimilar to BOTOX,European Commission approves Sarclisa® (isatuximab) for adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma,"The two companies will advance the development program of a proposed biosimilar to BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA), under 351(k) pathways. The US FDA’s feedback during BIAM indicated that the 351(k) regulatory pathways for an onabotulinumtoxinA product is viable
 Following the advancement of the program, Revance will receive $30M as milestones and is eligible to receive additional $70M in milestone payments, contingent upon the achievement of further clinical & regulatory milestones and a commercial milestone along with royalties on sales of the product in all relevant market
 In Feb 2018, the two companies collaborated for a proposed biosimilar to BOTOX, followed with commercialization by Mylan in the US, EU, and applicable markets throughout ROW. In 2019, the companies amended the agreement to include an additional one-time payment of $5M to extend the period in which Mylan could choose to continue its collaboration and license agreement to develop Revance’s biosimilar to BOTOX","PARIS – June 2, 2020 – The European Commission (EC) has approved Sarclisa® (isatuximab) in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.

Sarclisa is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor of MM cells.

“The EC approval of Sarclisa represents an important additional therapeutic option and may set a new standard of care for myeloma patients in Europe who are in need of new effective treatments because their disease has returned or they have become refractory to their previous treatment,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “Sarclisa in combination with pom-dex demonstrated median progression-free survival of nearly one year, a five-month improvement over pom-dex alone, in patients who had already failed at least two prior therapies.”

Sarclisa Efficacy and Safety Profile in Difficult-to-Treat Patients 

In the Phase 3 ICARIA-MM study, Sarclisa added to pom-dex (Sarclisa combination therapy, n=154) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of progression-free survival (PFS), with a median PFS of 11.53 months compared to 6.47 months with pom-dex alone (n=153) (HR 0.596, 95% CI: 0.44-0.81, p=0.001). Sarclisa combination therapy also demonstrated a significantly greater overall response rate compared to pom-dex alone (60.4% vs. 35.3%, p<0.0001). In additional analyses, Sarclisa combination therapy compared to pom-dex alone showed a treatment benefit consistent across select subgroups reflective of real-world practice, including patients with high risk cytogenetics, those aged 75 years and older, patients with renal insufficiency and patients who were refractory to lenalidomide.

“As patients experience relapse of their multiple myeloma or become refractory to their current therapy, they become more difficult to treat with increasingly poor prognoses. In the ICARIA-MM trial, Sarclisa combination therapy showed a treatment benefit consistent across relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma subgroups,” said Philippe Moreau, M.D., Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Nantes, France. “Sarclisa offers an important new treatment option and a potentially new standard of care for these patients with relapsed, refractory disease.”

As outlined in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), the most frequent adverse reactions observed with Sarclisa (occurring in 20% or more of patients) are neutropenia (46.7%), infusion reactions (38.2%), pneumonia (30.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (28.3%), diarrhea (25.7%) and bronchitis (23.7%). The most frequent serious adverse reactions are pneumonia (9.9%) and febrile neutropenia (6.6%).

For more information on the safety of Sarclisa, please refer to the SmPC.

An Important New Option for Treating Multiple Myeloma

Sarclisa is administered by intravenous (IV) administration and is dosed at 10 mg/kg, in combination with pom-dex, every week for four weeks and then every two weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Assuming no rate adjustments based on infusion-related reactions, the first infusion takes three to four hours, the second infusion takes less than two hours, and the remaining infusions can decrease to 75 minutes from the third infusion onwards. A treatment cycle is 28 days. The EC marketing authorization for Sarclisa is applicable to the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), plus the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

Multiple Myeloma: A Significant Burden to Patients

MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy,1 with more than 138,000 new cases worldwide each year.2 In Europe, approximately 40,000 patients are diagnosed with MM yearly.3 MM remains incurable in the vast majority of patients, resulting in significant disease burden.

About Sarclisa

Sarclisa is a mAb that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on MM cells, making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. It is designed to induce programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity.

In addition to the EU, Sarclisa has also been approved in the U.S., Switzerland, Canada and Australia in combination with pom-dex for the treatment of certain adults with relapsed refractory MM. In the U.S., the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The safety and efficacy of these additional uses have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority worldwide.

About XERAVATM

XERAVA (eravacycline for injection) is a novel fluorocycline of the tetracycline class antibacterials indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in patients 18 years of age and older. XERAVA was investigated for the treatment of cIAI as part of the Company’s IGNITE (Investigating Gram-Negative Infections Treated with Eravacycline) Phase 3 program. In the first pivotal Phase 3 trial in patients with cIAI, twice-daily intravenous (IV) XERAVA met the primary endpoint by demonstrating statistical non-inferiority of clinical response compared to ertapenem and was well-tolerated. In the second Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with cIAI, twice-daily IV XERAVA met the primary endpoint by demonstrating statistical non-inferiority of clinical response compared to meropenem and was well-tolerated. In both trials, XERAVA achieved high cure rates in patients with Gram-negative pathogens, including resistant isolates.

XERAVATM Important Safety Information

XERAVA is a tetracycline class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in patients 18 years of age and older.

XERAVA is not indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of XERAVA and other antibacterial drugs, XERAVA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

XERAVA is contraindicated for use in patients with known hypersensitivity to eravacycline, tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs or to any of the excipients. Life-threatening hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported with XERAVA.

The use of XERAVA during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of eight years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia.

The use of XERAVA during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of eight years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.

The most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials (incidence ≥ 3%) were infusion site reactions, nausea, and vomiting.

XERAVA is structurally similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse reactions. Adverse reactions including photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic action which has led to increased blood urea nitrogen, azotemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, pancreatitis, and abnormal liver function tests, have been reported for other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs, and may occur with XERAVA. Discontinue XERAVA if any of these adverse reactions are suspected.

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals Inc., at 1-833-7-XERAVA (1-833-793-7282) or FDA at 1‑800‑FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

These results show that once-daily treatment with single inhaler, high- and medium-dose Enerzair® Breezhaler® (QVM149; indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate [IND/GLY/MF]) demonstrated non-inferiority to a free combination of twice-daily, high-dose salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu) plus once-daily tiotropium (Tio), delivered in two different devices, in improving quality of life in people with uncontrolled asthma1. Among secondary analyses, improvements in lung function, asthma control, health status, and reductions in moderate exacerbations were observed with high-dose once-daily IND/GLY/MF compared to high-dose Sal/Flu plus Tio1.

“Today, over 45% of patients at GINA Steps 4 and 5 remain uncontrolled, despite current therapy, demonstrating the need for additional treatment options in this patient population,” said Assistant Professor Christian Gessner, Head of POIS Leipzig Study Centre and Guest Doctor at Universität Leipzig. “The ARGON study shows that once-daily IND/GLY/MF improves quality of life and, if approved, could provide an effective and convenient treatment for patients whose asthma is uncontrolled with LABA/ICS treatment.”

The primary endpoint of the study was met, with both high- and medium- doses of IND/GLY/MF demonstrating non-inferiority in change from baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) score (high: 0.073; medium: −0.038; both p<0.001)1.

“Novartis is reimagining respiratory medicine by developing innovative, patient-focused medicines such as IND/GLY/MF that address areas of significant unmet clinical need and improve symptom control and quality of life for people with asthma,” said Dominic Brittain, Respiratory Global Program Head, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “The ARGON study results show the potential benefits of this once-daily, single inhaler, LABA/LAMA/ICS treatment option in patients with uncontrolled asthma. These data build on the clinically meaningful improvements in lung function and reduction of exacerbations observed for high-dose IND/GLY/MF in the IRIDIUM study.”

In secondary analyses, improvements in asthma control (as measured by Asthma Control Questionnaire; ACQ-7 score [−0.124; p=0.004]) and lung function (as measured by trough FEV1 [96 mL; p<0.001]) were seen with high-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with high-dose Sal/Flu plus Tio1. In additional exploratory analyses, improvements in health status (as measured by St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire; SGRQ [−2.00; p=0.04]), and peak expiratory flow (morning [9.56 L/min; p=0.005], evening [9.15 L/min; p=0.006]) were seen with high-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with high-dose Sal/Flu plus Tio1. A greater reduction in the rate of moderate exacerbations (43%; p=0.04) was seen with high-dose IND/GLY/MF versus high-dose Sal/Flu plus Tio; the rate of exacerbations across all severities was comparable between the two treatment groups1. Comparable efficacy in these endpoints was seen with medium-dose IND/GLY/MF versus high-dose Sal/Flu plus Tio, but at a corresponding lower steroid dose1. Adverse events were generally comparable across treatments1.

The ARGON study assessed IND/GLY/MF, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in high- (150/50/160 µg) and medium- (150/50/80 µg) doses, delivered via the Breezhaler®, compared with a free combination of twice-daily high-dose Sal/Flu (50/500μg) plus once-daily Tio (5 μg) in patients with asthma not adequately controlled on current inhaled therapies, over 24 weeks of active treatment1.

To date, high-dose IND/GLY/MF has received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP); this submission was supported by the IRIDIUM study1,2. The positive opinion for Enerzair® Breezhaler® also covered a digital companion with app and sensor that provide inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data to better support therapeutic decisions. Further regulatory reviews are currently underway in multiple countries, including Switzerland and Japan.

In keeping with the Novartis commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our asthma combinations, IND/GLY/MF will be available in the Breezhaler® device which is hydrofluoroalkane/chlorofluorocarbon (HFA/CFC)-free.

About Uncontrolled Asthma 
Asthma affects an estimated 358 million people worldwide and can cause a significant personal, health and financial burden when not adequately controlled3,4. Despite current therapy, over 40% of patients with asthma at Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 3, and over 45% at GINA Steps 4 and 5 remain uncontrolled5,6. Patients with uncontrolled asthma may downplay or underestimate the severity of their disease and are at a higher risk of exacerbation, hospitalization or death7,8,9. Barriers, such as treatment mismatch, safety issues with an oral corticosteroid and ineligibility for biologics, have created an unmet medical need in asthma10,11.

About Enerzair® Breezhaler® in the EU
The CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of high-dose Enerzair® Breezhaler® (QVM149; IND/GLY/MF) 150/50/160 μg once-daily as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long‑acting beta2‑agonist (LABA) and a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year12. This formulation combines the bronchodilation of indacaterol acetate (a LABA) and the antimuscarinic effects of glycopyrronium bromide (a LAMA) with mometasone furoate (ICS) in a precise once-daily formulation, delivered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device. Glycopyrronium bromide certain use and formulation intellectual property were exclusively licensed to Novartis in April 2005 by Sosei Heptares and Vectura. Mometasone furoate is exclusively licensed to Novartis from a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, for use in IND/GLY/MF (worldwide excluding the US).

IND/GLY/MF will be administered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device, which enables once-daily inhalation using a single inhaler. If approved, IND/GLY/MF will be the first asthma treatment in the EU that can be prescribed together with a digital companion; the Propeller Health app and a sensor custom-built for the Breezhaler® device. The digital companion will provide patients with inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data that can be shared with their physician in order to help them make better therapeutic decisions. The sensor for the Breezhaler® device was developed by Propeller Health and is a CE marked Medical Device, designed and licensed to Novartis exclusively for use with the Breezhaler® inhaler worldwide. The sensor includes a microchip, a microphone, Bluetooth capabilities, an antenna and a battery. The sensor does not alter the drug delivery characteristics of the Breezhaler® inhaler itself but produces a recording of each administered dose. Based on the patient’s recorded medication usage, personalized content is presented within the app to help the patient better self-manage their asthma.

About the PLATINUM Clinical Development Program
The PLATINUM program, containing over 7,500 patients worldwide, is the Novartis Phase III/IIIb clinical development program supporting the development of IND/GLY/MF and IND/MF. It includes four studies: the QUARTZ study, which compared a low-dose of IND/MF with MF alone; the PALLADIUM study, which compared IND/MF with MF and salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu); the IRIDIUM study, which compared IND/GLY/MF with IND/MF and Sal/Flu; and the ARGON study, which compared IND/GLY/MF with a free combination of Sal/Flu plus tiotropium (Tio).

About the ARGON study1
ARGON (NCT03158311) is a Phase IIIb, multicenter, randomized, 24-week, parallel-group, non-inferiority, open-label (blinded for the two IND/GLY/MF tested doses), active-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of IND/GLY/MF with a free combination of salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu) plus tiotropium (Tio) in patients with uncontrolled asthma.

The purpose of this trial was to demonstrate that the efficacy of two doses of the fixed-dose combination product IND/GLY/MF (high: 150/50/160 μg and medium: 150/50/80 μg) is non-inferior to the efficacy of the free combination of Sal/Flu (50/500 μg) plus Tio (5 μg) in patients with uncontrolled asthma.

All patients were symptomatic at screening despite treatment with medium- or high- stable doses of LABA/ICS as defined by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score ≥1.5.

Approximately 1,251 male and female patients with uncontrolled asthma (aged 18 and above) were randomized 1:1:1 (approximately 417 patients in each of the treatment groups) to receive either:

IND/GLY/MF 150/50/80 μg (once-daily)
IND/GLY/MF 150/50/160 μg (once-daily)
Open label Sal/Flu 50/500 μg (twice-daily) delivered via Diskus® plus Tio delivered via Respimat®
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of both high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF to comparator Sal/Flu plus Tio after 24 weeks of treatment based on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ).

Secondary objectives included:

To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus Tio based on trough FEV1 after 24 weeks of treatment.
To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus Tio based on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) over 24 weeks of treatment.
To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus Tio based on ACQ-7 over 24 weeks of treatment.
To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus Tio based on lung function over 24 weeks of treatment.

34434,AstraZeneca in Talks with Gilead for a Megamerger,AstraZeneca Approaches Gilead About Potential Merger,"As per Bloomberg, AstraZeneca communicated with Gilead about a possible merger to form the world’s largest drug company. Last month, AstraZeneca approached Gilead to measure its interest in a possible merger
 The merger would unite two of the companies at the forefront of the industry’s efforts to combat COVID-19 and could be politically sensitive as governments seek control over potential vaccines or treatments
 If combined, the two companies would have a market capitalization of ~$232B, which would surpass Merck & Co. and Pfizer at $207B and $200B respectively. Additionally, the deal would exceed BMS’ $74B acquisition of Celgene","AstraZeneca Plc has made a preliminary approach to rival drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc. about a potential merger, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be the biggest health-care deal on record.

The U.K.-based firm informally contacted Gilead last month to gauge its interest in a possible tie-up, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. AstraZeneca didn’t specify terms for any transaction, they said. While Gilead has discussed the idea with advisers, no decisions have been made on how to proceed and the companies aren’t in formal talks, the people added.

AstraZeneca, valued at $140 billion, is the U.K.’s biggest drugmaker by market capitalization and has developed treatments for conditions from cancer to cardiovascular disease. Gilead, worth $96 billion at Friday’s close, is the creator of a drug that’s received U.S. approval for use with coronavirus patients.

Gilead is not currently interested in selling to or merging with another big pharmaceutical company, preferring instead to focus its deal strategy on partnerships and smaller acquisitions, the people said. A representative for Gilead declined to comment. A spokesman for AstraZeneca said the company doesn’t comment on “rumors or speculation.”

The overtures show how the pharmaceutical industry landscape could shift at a time when drugmakers are racing to find effective treatments for Covid-19. If a deal goes ahead, it would surpass Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s $74 billion takeover of Celgene Corp. last year as the biggest-ever health-care acquisition, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It would also rank among the 10 biggest M&A transactions of all time.

Shares of AstraZeneca have risen about 41% over the past 12 months, making it the best performer on a Bloomberg Intelligence index of major Western pharmaceutical companies. Shares of Gilead gained about 19% over the period.

Gilead has attracted investor interest as its antiviral drug for Covid-19, remdesivir, worked its way through clinical trials in recent months. The stock is still more than a third lower than its 2015 highs. The Foster City, California-based company has seen a steady decline in sales in its hepatitis C franchise and is trying to reinvigorate its drug-development pipeline.

Remdesivir, which has an emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has been shown in some early studies to shorten hospital stays for people with Covid-19. SVB Leerink recently forecast that sales of the drug may reach $7.7 billion in 2022.

Gilead has been dispensing early rounds of the drug for free, leading some investors to question how the company plans to make money from it in the future. Chief Executive Officer Daniel O’Day has said the company may spend $1 billion on the treatment this year alone.

AstraZeneca is helping to manufacture a Covid vaccine developed at the University of Oxford. The U.S. has pledged as much as $1.2 billion to support the efforts as part of Operation Warp Speed, a push to secure vaccines for America. The shot is expected to enter final-stage clinical trials in June.

Gilead was founded in 1987 by Michael Riordan, a doctor with a Harvard MBA who aimed to discover treatments for viral infections after a bout with dengue fever acquired in southeast Asia. The company’s best-known successes include Tamiflu, the influenza treatment it helped develop.

The company also makes Truvada, a medicine that can help prevent HIV, as well as drugs for liver disease and inflammation. Gilead employs about 12,000 people, according to its website.

AstraZeneca is no stranger to large-scale, politically sensitive M&A. In 2014 it fended off a $117 billion approach from Pfizer Inc., a deal that attracted attention from U.S. lawmakers as it would have allowed New York-based Pfizer to lower its tax bill by redomiciling in the U.K.

Deal Slump
Health-care dealmaking has been a rare bright spot as the global pandemic and resulting lockdowns have doused the market for mergers and acquisitions. Global M&A volumes are down about 45% this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and announced deals have been falling apart at a steady pace.

Excluding minority investments, dealmaking in April and May barely topped $100 billion in total, the data show, the lowest two-month period in at least 22 years.

AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, a former executive at oncology specialist Roche Holding AG, has transformed the company since taking the helm nearly eight years ago. At the time, it was struggling with an aging stable of drugs and a shortage of innovation.

He’s championed the development of Lynparza, which was initially approved for ovarian cancer but has also proved useful for treating other forms of the disease. AstraZeneca has since overtaken U.K. rival GlaxoSmithKline Plc in market value.

Last year, AstraZeneca sealed its biggest transaction in more than a decade, agreeing to pay as much as $6.9 billion to buy into a promising breast cancer treatment developed by Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo Co. The U.K. company reached a deal this month with Accent Therapeutics Inc.to potentially spend more than $1.1 billion collaborating on novel oncology therapies.

AstraZeneca shares have also been boosted by positive data from trials of its blockbuster lung cancer drug Tagrisso.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gilead-Aztrazzeneca.jpg,M&A,Astrazeneca | Gilead,,M&A|Approaches|Over|Potential Megamerger,publish,6/8/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/astrazeneca-approaches-gilead-about-potential-merger/,https://pharmashots.com/34434/astrazeneca-in-talks-with-gilead-for-a-megamerger/

The focus of the collaboration is on advancing the fully human, neutralizing antibody 47D11 discovered by UU, EMC and HBM and recently reported in Nature Communications. This antibody targets the conserved domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

Under the terms of the collaboration, AbbVie will support UU, EMC and HBM through the preclinical activities, while simultaneously undertaking preparations for later stage preclinical and clinical development work. AbbVie will receive an option to exclusively license the antibody from the three parties for therapeutic clinical development and commercialization worldwide.

“Treatment and prevention of COVID-19 remains a critical global need. The antibody discovered by UU, EMC and Harbour BioMed is extremely promising based on the mechanism by which it targets the virus and on its developability as a fully human protein,” said Tom Hudson, M.D., Senior Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie. “We look forward to working with this outstanding team to advance this antibody towards clinical trials.”

“AbbVie is a global leader in developing innovative antiviral therapies,” said Dr. Jingsong Wang, Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of HBM. “This collaboration will greatly accelerate our efforts to bring this antibody forward into clinical trials as quickly as possible and contribute a solution to this pandemic.”

“The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the importance of understanding coronavirus biology,” said Berend-Jan Bosch, PhD, Associate Professor, Research leader at UU. “The collaboration with AbbVie provides an excellent opportunity to translate our research into a clinical candidate with great potential for advancing the fight against this disease.”

Frank Grosveld, PhD, Academy Professor of Cell Biology, EMC, Rotterdam and Founding Chief Scientific Officer at Harbour BioMed, commented, “The collaboration is an endorsement of our approach to fully human antibody discovery and development. Through this collaboration, we are well positioned to move rapidly towards clinical trials.”

The antibody discovery, published online on May 4 in Nature Communications, targets a conserved region of the virus’ spike protein. In cell culture studies the antibody blocked infection by the SARS-CoV-2 and a second coronavirus SARS-CoV. The antibody is fully human, which is designed to facilitate its development and minimize immune-related side effects.

 VMIC will provide manufacturing equipment whereas Oxford Biomedica will provide training and technical assistance to VMIC staff to accelerate the GMP manufacturing capabilities for AZD1222 at VMIC’s Harwell Science and Innovation Campus’ manufacturing site, expected to open in mid-2021
 On May 28, 2020, AstraZeneca got global manufacturing, development and distribution responsibilities for AZD1222 from Oxford Biomedica under a clinical and commercial supply agreement","Oxford, UK – 8 June, 2020: Oxford Biomedica plc (LSE:OXB) (“Oxford Biomedica” or “the Group”), a leading gene and cell therapy group, announced today that it has signed a Collaboration Agreement (“the Agreement”) with the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), a not-for-profit organisation established to provide the UK’s first strategic vaccine development and advanced manufacturing capability. This five year Agreement will involve the organisations working collaboratively to enable the manufacture of viral vector based vaccines, contributing towards a rapid increase in UK domestic capacity for this specialised field of vaccine manufacturing.

Both Oxford Biomedica and VMIC are original members of the Oxford University manufacturing consortium focussed on scaling-up the GMP manufacture of the adenovirus vector based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, AZD1222 (previously known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), which has entered clinical trials at multiple sites in the UK. AstraZeneca has now taken over global responsibility for the manufacturing, development and distribution for AZD1222 with an initial clinical and commercial supply agreement for multiple batches signed between AstraZeneca and Oxford Biomedica on the 28 May.

As part of the Collaboration Agreement, VMIC will provide manufacturing equipment for Oxford Biomedica to rapidly equip two new GMP manufacturing suites within Oxford Biomedica’s new 7,800 m2 commercial manufacturing centre, Oxbox, located in Oxford, UK. This will provide significant additional manufacturing capacity and enable further scale up for AZD1222 from the summer of 2020 as needed to help supply UK and European vaccine demand. These suites could also potentially be utilised for other viral vector vaccine candidates. As part of the Agreement, Oxford Biomedica will provide training and technical assistance to VMIC staff to accelerate the operational readiness and GMP manufacturing capabilities for viral vector vaccine candidates at VMIC’s new manufacturing site located at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus. The VMIC facility is due to open in mid-2021, a year ahead of schedule.

The Agreement also provides a framework for a longer-term partnership between Oxford Biomedica and VMIC, whereby Oxford Biomedica could rapidly provide its commercial scale manufacturing capacity to supply other novel viral vector vaccine candidates for the UK population, when needed.

John Dawson, Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Biomedica, said: “
Since we became involved in addressing the urgent need for UK manufacturing capacity for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate AZD1222, we have strived to support VMIC’s broader goal of accelerating and supporting UK manufacturing capacity and capabilities for vaccines more generally. This highly collaborative partnership allows for a rapid deployment capability to be established, and also accelerates fit out and utilisation of another two GMP manufacturing suites within our new commercial manufacturing facility, Oxbox.”

Matthew Duchars, Chief Executive Officer of Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre, said:
“This collaboration with Oxford Biomedica means that together we can significantly increase the UK’s capacity to manufacture viral vectors vaccines as part of a national effort in response to COVID-19. This marks a major milestone for VMIC in setting up collaborative partnerships with industry – this is the first collaboration agreement outside of our founding partners under VMIC’s longer term objective of boosting the UK’s vaccines manufacturing capability.”

Kate Bingham, Chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, said: “
The Government is backing the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre as a crucial part of securing long-term vaccine manufacturing capability in the UK. Viral vector Covid-19 vaccine candidates are showing significant promise. This new partnership between VMIC and Oxford Biomedica marks a major milestone in increasing the UK manufacturing capacity of viral vector vaccines and will specifically help ensure that we have the right skills in place to manufacture a vaccine as soon as one is available.”

34464,AstraZeneca Reports Results of Calquence (acalabrutinib) in CALAVI Study for Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,Calquence showed promising clinical improvement in majority of 19 hospitalised COVID-19 patients,"The CALAVI program involves assessing of Calquence + BSC vs BSC as monothx. in patients hospitalized with respiratory complications of COVID-19, but not on assisted ventilation. The studies are being conducted in the US and outside the US including the EU, Japan and South America
 The drug demonstrated the clinical improvement in peer-reviewed case series of 19 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hypoxia and/or inflammation. Results were published in Science Immunology
 Calquence is a BTK inhibitor, act by inhibiting its activity and has received the US FDA approval for hematological malignancies","Improved laboratory markers of inflammation and decreased oxygen requirements observed in most patients 
Ongoing global trials aim to confirm findings
Results published in Science Immunology showed that Calquence (acalabrutinib), a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, reduced markers of inflammation and improved clinical outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 disease.1

The peer-reviewed case series of 19 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 disease and severe hypoxia and/or inflammation is a collaboration from investigators across the US, including AstraZeneca scientists, and led by Wyndham Wilson, M.D., Ph.D. and Louis Staudt, M.D., Ph.D. at the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health in the US.

The publication describes the effects of Calquence administration in patients with severe respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.1 A virus-induced hyperimmune response or “cytokine storm” is hypothesised to be a major pathogenic mechanism of respiratory illness in these patients, and evidence suggests that dysregulated BTK-dependent lung macrophage signalling mediates this cytokine storm and plays a role in COVID-19 pneumonia. 2-7

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “The science supporting investigation of the use of Calquencein patients with severe COVID-19 is strong. The encouraging preliminary data in this case series has informed the initiation of global phase II trials, notably the CALAVI programme. We look forward to completing recruitment and obtaining data in these trials as soon as possible to further our understanding of what this potential treatment could mean for patients.”

Calquence is a next-generation, selective BTK inhibitor currently approved in the US for the treatment of certain haematological malignancies.8-10 Calquence is not currently approved in any country to treat patients with illnesses related to SARS-CoV-2.

CALAVI

The CALAVI programme comprises two randomised, open-label, multicentre, global trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Calquence with best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone in patients hospitalised with respiratory complications of COVID-19. These trials are evaluating the addition of Calquence to current BSC in patients who are hospitalised but not on assisted ventilation. These trials are being conducted around the world: one trial in the US and one trial ex-US including Europe, Japan and South America. The primary efficacy endpoint measures the number of patients alive and free of respiratory failure following treatment.11,12

COVID-19

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most COVID-19 cases (~80%) are mild respiratory illnesses.13,14 However, some require hospitalisation, mostly due to pneumonia, and can progress quickly to severe acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is associated with high mortality.3,15 A viral-induced “cytokine storm” or hyperimmune response is hypothesised to be a major pathogenic mechanism of ARDS in these patients through modulation of pulmonary macrophages and dendritic cells and/or neutrophils.4,7

Calquence

Calquence is a next-generation, selective inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Calquence binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.8-10 In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.10

In the US, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and India, Calquence is approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and in Canada for CLL. Calquence is also approved in the US and a few other countries for adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. This indication is approved in the US under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

Calquence is not currently approved in any country to treat patients with illnesses related to SARS-CoV-2.

BTK Inhibition

In lung macrophages, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key regulator of the production of multiple cytokines and chemokines including TNFa, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1, among others. BTK inhibition reduces the production of these cytokines and is, therefore, a promising strategy to reduce the respiratory complications of COVID-19.15

There is evidence that dysregulated BTK-dependent macrophage signalling may be central to the exaggerated inflammatory responses to SARS-COV-2 and play a role in COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 3-6 In macrophages, TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8 can recognise single strand RNA from viruses such as SARS-COV-2 and initiate signalling through BTK-dependent activation of NF-kB and IRF3, triggering the production of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 4-7 In support of the role of BTK inhibition, therapeutic inhibition of BTK in patients with lymphoid malignancies results in decreased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Similar findings have been observed in mouse influenza models, where BTK inhibition also decreased these inflammatory mediators and rescued mice from lethal acute lung injury.

Additionally, Lilly is planning to evaluate the efficacy of JS016 as both a monothx. and a combination with other Ab treatments in COVID-19 patients. The cocktails will include JS016 & LY-CoV555, as well as other Abs, currently in preclinical development","The first healthy volunteer has been dosed in a Phase 1 study of JS016, the lead antibody from Lilly’s collaboration with Junshi Biosciences 

– Junshi Biosciences is conducting its Phase 1 study in China with Lilly to imminently begin its Phase 1 study in the United States 

– Lilly will evaluate efficacy of JS016 as both a single agent and a combination with other antibody treatments in COVID-19 patients 

– Should Phase 1 results show the antibody can be safely administered, the companies will initiate Phase 2 studies to assess efficacy

INDIANAPOLIS, June 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced today its partner Junshi Biosciences (HKEX: 1877) has dosed the first healthy volunteer in a study of a potential neutralizing antibody treatment designed to fight COVID-19.

The investigational medicine, referred to as JS016, is being co-developed by Junshi Biosciences and Lilly, with Junshi Biosciences leading development in Greater China. Lilly has exclusive rights in the rest of the world and will begin dosing patients in a complementary Phase 1 study in the United States in the coming days. Both Phase 1 studies aim to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of JS016 in healthy participants who have not been diagnosed with COVID-19. This is Lilly’s second neutralizing antibody to start clinical trials, following LY-CoV555 that recently entered Phase 1 and is currently being tested in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Lilly is planning a clinical development program which includes a portfolio of monotherapy and combination antibody regimens (the latter often referred to as antibody “cocktails”) in order to understand which provide the best efficacy and tolerability in patients. These cocktails will include JS016, LY-CoV555, as well as additional antibodies currently in preclinical development. JS016 and LY-CoV555 bind different epitopes on the spike protein and thus expand the diversity of options for achieving efficacy and avoiding resistance.

“There is much we still don’t know about COVID-19,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “The best path to learn more about the potential for neutralizing antibodies, either as monotherapy or in combination, is through carefully controlled randomized trials.

KN026 is an anti-HER2 bispecific antibody which can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes of HER2 and lead to a dual HER2 signal blockade, presumedly causing HER2 to aggregate on the cell surface and endocytose. Current clinicals trials shown promising preliminary efficacy and excellent safety profile in late-stage breast cancer patients who have failed multiple treatments in China, laying a solid foundation for future development of combination therapies in multiple front line settings. Given its clinical profile, KN026 has the potential to address the medical needs of around 2 million patients suffering from HER2-positive breast cancer in China, USA and key European markets.

Taxotere® (Docetaxel) is a microtubule inhibitor that interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body. It is used to treat breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer. In China, Taxotere® is indicated for breast cancer (BC) including: 1) single agent for locally advanced or metastatic BC after chemotherapy failure; 2) with trastuzumab for the 1st line treatment of metastatic BC patients with HER2 overexpression; 3) and with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive BC.

Dr. Ting XU, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Alphamab Oncology commented, “KN026 is a core candidate of our innovative bispecific antibody pipeline, and has shown convincing advantages in safety and efficacy from current clinical studies. There are significant unmet need for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. We hope, through the collaboration with Sanofi, a global biopharmaceutical leader, to further drive KN026’s China and global development strategy, to provide a superior therapeutic solution to Her-2 positive patients.”

Hornstein, PhD, General Manager General Medicines and Country Lead, Sanofi China commented, “Building on Sanofi’s heritage in oncology, we see a significant opportunity to impact the health of breast cancer patients by partnering with Alphamab, a biopharmaceutical leader in China. This strategic partnership also demonstrates Sanofi’s ambition to play a more active role in the Chinese healthcare ecosystem, offering more new treatments for the large Chinese population with joint efforts from other leading companies.”

Under terms of the agreement, Jiangsu Alphamab and Sanofi will collaborate to evaluate the combination of KN026 and Taxotere® (Docetaxel) for HER2+ breast cancer. Patient enrollment has started for the initial multicenter, open-label study.

About KN026

KN026 is an anti-HER2 bispecific antibody developed by Alphamab Oncology using the proprietary Fc-based heterodimer bispecific platform technology called CRIB (Charge Repulsion Induced Bispecific). KN026 can bind two non-overlapping epitopes of HER2 simultaneously, leading to a dual HER2 signal blockade. In pre-clinical studies, KN026 has demonstrated potentially equivalent or superior efficacy compared with Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab alone or in combination, such as increased binding affinity, as well as better tumor inhibition in HER2-positive tumor cell lines. Additionally, KN026 has also shown inhibitory effect on tumor cells with medium or low HER2 expression or Trastuzumab-resistant cell lines.

KN026 received IND approval from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018. Currently, it is in multiple phase I/II clinical trials in China and phase I clinical trial in the United States. The results of Phase I clinical trials show KN026 has excellent safety, tolerance and potentially superior anti-tumor activity in HER2-positive breast cancer patients who progressed after multiple lines of anti-HER2 treatment.

34500,Astellas Reports Results of Roxadustat in P-III DOLOMITES Study to Treat Anemia in Non-Dialysis Dependent Adult Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease,Roxadustat Demonstrates Non-Inferiority to Darbepoetin in Phase 3 DOLOMITES Study of Anemia in Non-DialysisDependent Adult Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease,"The P-III study involves assessing of Roxadustat (N=323) vs darbepoetin alfa (N=293) evaluating its safety and efficacy in (N=616) adult anemia patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease (CKD)
 The study meet its 1EPs & 2EPs also demonstrated superiority, showing correction of hemoglobin levels during the first 24 wks. (89.5% vs 78.0%), decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with LSM diff. (-0.403 mmol/L), non-inferiority data with mean arterial pressure with LSM diff. (-0.372 mmHg), safety & AEs (91.6% vs 92.5%), MACE (0.81 vs 0.90), Presented at ERA-EDTA 2020
 Roxadustat (PO) is a novel inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase (PH) which leads to increment in hemoglobin levels, approved and launched for anemia associated with CKD in Japan in DD patients and in China for both DD and NDD patients","TOKYO, June 8, 2020 – Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) today nounced results from the Phase 3 DOLOMITES study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of roxadustat compared with darbepoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in non-dialysis dependent (NDD) adult patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Abstract: MO001). The data presented during an oral presentation at the 57th European Renal
Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) Virtual Congress, taking place between June 6–9, 2020, showed non-inferiority of roxadustat to darbepoetin alfa in the correction of hemoglobin levels during the first 24 weeks of treatment (89.5% vs 78.0%; a difference of 11.51% [95% confidence interval (Cl): 5.66%, 17.36%]), meeting the study’s primary endpoint with a lower bound of the 95% CI >0.
Secondary endpoints were hierarchically tested for non-inferiority and superiority. Superiority of roxadustat to darbepoetin alfa was demonstrated by a decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with a least square mean (LSM) difference of -0.403 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.510, -0.296; [P<0.01]) and in time to first intravenous iron use with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.78; [P=0.004]). The non-inferiority of roxadustat to darbepoetin alfa was demonstrated for mean arterial pressure with a LSM difference of -0.372 mmHg (95% CI: -1.587, 0.842) and time to occurrence of hypertension (HR=0.83; [95% CI: 0.56, 1.22]). Regarding safety, the overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was comparable between roxadustat and darbepoetin alfa (91.6% and 92.5%, respectively). A non-confirmatory analysis of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE)/MACE plus hospitalized unstable angina and
2 hospitalized congestive heart failure (MACE+) outcomes showed HR point estimates of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.25) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.32).
“The goal of treatment for anemia in CKD is to raise and stabilize hemoglobin levels, yet as many as half of CKD anemia patients have hemoglobin levels outside the recommended target values, often leaving them with debilitating symptoms that can make daily activities extremely challenging,” said Jonathan Barratt, Ph.D., FRCP, Consultant Nephrologist and the Mayer Professor of Renal Medicine at the University of Leicester, United Kingdom. “The DOLOMITES study results
demonstrate the ability of roxadustat to correct and maintain hemoglobin levels in people with CKD anemia not on dialysis for up to 2 years.”
As a first-in-class orally administered inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase (PH), roxadustat increases hemoglobin levels with a mechanism of action that is different from that of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). As a HIF-PH inhibitor, roxadustat activates the body’s natural protective response to reduced oxygen levels in the blood. This response involves the regulation of multiple, complementary processes that promote a coordinated erythropoiesis and increase the blood’s oxygen-carrying capacity.
“The DOLOMITES study data add to the body of evidence supporting the efficacy of roxadustat in adult CKD patients with anemia who are not dialysis dependent, this time versus an active comparator, darbepoetin,” said Bernhardt G Zeiher, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Astellas. “This study, designed to assess the novel mechanism of action of roxadustat in correcting and maintaining hemoglobin levels, reinforces Astellas’ commitment to turning innovative science into
value for patients and addressing the unmet medical needs of people living with CKD and the added complication of anemia.”

The study enrolled 616 adult anemia patients with stage 3-5 CKD, of which 323 received roxadustat and 293 received darbepoetin alfa. The response in correction of
hemoglobin levels was defined as achieving Hb≥11g/dL and Hb change from BL of ≥1g/dL if the BL Hb>8g/dL, and the change from BL in Hb levels of ≥2g/dL if the BL Hb≤8g/dL. For more information about this study, visit ww.clinicaltrials.gov [NCT02021318].1
About CKD and Anemia
CKD is characterized by a progressive loss of kidney function caused by damage to the kidneys resulting from conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or immune-regulated inflammatory conditions.2
Worldwide 1 in 10 people are living with CKD.3 In Europe, 1 in 8 people are living with CKD,3 of whom 1 in 5 are affected by anemia; this rate increases to 1 in 2 in people with the most severe CKD (CKD stage 5).4
Globally, CKD is predicted to become the fifth most common cause of premature death by 2040.5 It is a critical worldwide healthcare issue that represents a large and growing unmet medical need.
Anemia is a common complication of CKD,6 resulting from the failing kidneys’ ability to produce erythropoietin, reduced oxygen sensing, and increased hepcidin and iron deficiency resulting from chronic inflammation. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in dialysis and nondialysis populations, increasing in both prevalence and severity as kidney disease worsens.7

34508,Mallinckrodt Reports Completion of BLA Submission to the US FDA for StrataGraft to Treat Deep Partial-Thickness Thermal Burns in Adults,Mallinckrodt Completes Rolling Submission of Biologics License Application for StrataGraft® Regenerative Skin Tissue to U.S. Food and Drug Administration,"In Apr 2020, Mallinckrodt’s Stratatech initiated StrataGraft’s BLA submission process which is a regenerative skin tissue therapy to develop therapies for deep partial-thickness thermal burns in adults
 The BLA submission is based on P-III STRATA2016 clinical trial published in Journal of Burn Care & Research and is supported by STRATA2011 clinical trial (Published in Burns) further for presentation at the American Burn Association 52nd Annual Meeting
 StrataGraft regenerative skin tissue therapy is targeted for the reduction of autograft in patients with severe thermal burns and is cryopreserved for delivering viable cells upon application. The therapy has also received the US FDA’s ODD and was a novel product designated as Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) under the provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act","STAINES-UPON-THAMES, United Kingdom, June 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE: MNK), a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that Stratatech, a Mallinckrodt company, has completed its rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for StrataGraft®, a regenerative skin tissue therapy in development for the treatment of adult patients with deep partial-thickness thermal burns. The company previously announced initiation of the rolling submission in April. StrataGraft skin tissue is an investigational product, and its safety and effectiveness have not yet been established by the FDA.

“Completion of the BLA submission is the culmination of many years of hard work and brings us one step closer to our goal of providing StrataGraft skin tissue as a new treatment option for patients in the United States with deep partial-thickness thermal burns, if approved,” said Steven Romano, M.D., executive vice president and chief scientific officer at Mallinckrodt. “We would like to thank the many researchers, clinical trial investigators and patients who helped us reach this important milestone. We look forward to working closely with the FDA during the regulatory review process.”

The StrataGraft skin tissue BLA is based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 STRATA2016 clinical trial, previously published as an abstract in the Journal of Burn Care & Research and accepted for presentation at the American Burn Association 52nd Annual Meeting, with support from the STRATA2011 clinical trial, previously published in Burns.

The FDA granted StrataGraft skin tissue orphan drug status, and it was among the first products designated by the Agency as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) under the provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act.

About StrataGraft
StrataGraft regenerative skin tissue is an investigational treatment being developed to reduce autograft in patients with severe thermal burns. An engineered, bilayer tissue, StrataGraft skin tissue is designed to mimic natural human skin with both inner dermis-like and outer epidermis-like layers. StrataGraft skin tissue can be sutured, stapled or secured with an adhesive. StrataGraft skin tissue is cryopreserved in order to deliver viable cells upon application.

Mallinckrodt is currently conducting a StrataGraft skin tissue continued access clinical trial (StrataCAT, NCT04123548) under an Expanded Access Program (EAP). The trial sites involved in the pivotal Phase 3 trial (STRATA2016, NCT03005106) have the opportunity to participate in this multicenter, open-label study. The company is planning to evaluate StrataGraft skin tissue for the treatment of adults with full-thickness burns (also referred to as third-degree burns). Additionally, Mallinckrodt plans to conduct a study evaluating StrataGraft skin tissue in treatment of pediatric populations.

StrataGraft skin tissue is an investigational product, and its safety and effectiveness have not yet been established by the FDA.

Funding and technical support for the continued development of StrataGraft skin tissue, including the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (STRATA2016) and the Biological Licensing Application process for StrataGraft tissue in the United States, is being provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Project BioShield Contract No. HHSO100201500027C. These efforts are part of BARDA’s strategy to build emergency preparedness in response to mass casualty events involving trauma and thermal burns by developing novel medical countermeasures for adult and at-risk populations. In the case of a mass casualty thermal burn event, the Government Accountability Office estimates that more than 10,000 patients might require thermal burn care.1 The limited number of specialized burn centers and related medical infrastructure in the United States creates a public health need for therapies that could be deployed quickly for use in these and other care sites.

About Deep Partial-Thickness Thermal Burns
Deep partial-thickness thermal burns are complex skin injuries in which the damage extends through the entire epidermis (outermost layer of skin) and into the lower part of the dermis (innermost layer of skin).

Autograft is considered to be a standard of care by many for deep partial-thickness thermal burns. It involves the surgical harvesting of healthy skin tissue from an uninjured site on the patient and transplanting the skin graft to the injury. While this process can be effective in providing closure of the original wound, it has significant limitations related to the donor site wounds created during surgical removal of the skin tissue for grafting. Donor site wounds are painful and can create risks of additional scarring and infection. In addition, the amount of healthy skin available for harvesting is frequently limited in those patients with large burns, necessitating sequential re-harvesting of available donor sites. As a result, there is a need for alternatives to donor site harvesting for the treatment of severe burns.

 Trulicity (dulaglutide) is an injectable prescribed medicine for T2D patients used to improve blood sugar (glucose) and used to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, or stroke in people who have heart disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors","INDIANAPOLIS, June 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The first patient dose has been delivered in SURPASS-CVOT, the phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial for tirzepatide, Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) investigational dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist. The study will assess both non-inferiority and superiority of tirzepatide in a head-to-head trial against Trulicity® (dulaglutide) 1.5 mg – the market leading GLP-1 receptor agonist.

“Lilly is making a bold move by comparing tirzepatide to Trulicity, which is already proven to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events,” said study co-chairs David A. D’Alessio, M.D., Chief in the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Duke University School of Medicine, and Stephen Nicholls, M.B.,B.S., Ph.D., Director of the Monash University Victorian Heart Institute, on behalf of the study’s Academic Executive Committee. “SURPASS-CVOT will provide clinicians of people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease with important evidence about the potential of tirzepatide to deliver outcomes beyond today’s best-in-class medicines.”

SURPASS-CVOT (NCT04255433) includes 12,500 participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease from 30 countries. The primary endpoint measures time to first occurrence of MACE-3, the composite endpoint of CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke. Key secondary endpoints measure time to all-cause mortality and time to occurrence of each component of the primary endpoint. Lilly anticipates the trial will take just over four years to complete.

“We are constantly evaluating the needs of people living with diabetes and are committed to researching innovative medicines that reflect the evolution in the standards of diabetes care,” said Jeff Riesmeyer, Distinguished Medical Fellow, Lilly. “We are confident in the potential of tirzepatide to help people with type 2 diabetes achieve additional benefits beyond blood glucose control alone and look forward to results from SURPASS-CVOT.”

The P-Ib studies has met its safety endpoints in patients with ALS and AD, further dose escalation to achieve higher levels of target inhibition may be limited by preclinical chronic safety data
 The two companies will pause the clinical studies of DNL747 and focus on accelerating development of DNL788 in neurological indications, with a plan to initiate its clinical testing by early 2021
 Sanofi has completed P-I study of DNL758 in healthy volunteer and is planning further clinical studies in multiple indications following the P-I data","Denali and Sanofi pause DNL747(a) clinical activities based on the totality of DNL747 data and a superior profile of backup compound DNL788(b)
Denali and Sanofi intend to accelerate DNL788 for development in neurological indications, with plans to initiate clinical testing by early 2021
Safety endpoints were met in Phase 1b patient studies with DNL747 in ALS and Alzheimer’s disease, however further dose escalation to achieve higher levels of target inhibition may be limited by preclinical chronic safety data
Sanofi successfully completed the Phase 1 healthy volunteer study with peripherally-restricted RIPK1 inhibitor DNL758(c), and further clinical studies in multiple indications are being planned
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, June 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Denali Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: DNLI), a biopharmaceutical company developing a broad portfolio of product candidates engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier (“BBB”) for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced the results from its Phase 1b studies with small molecule RIPK1 inhibitor DNL747 in Alzheimer’s disease and ALS, and provided a broad RIPK1 program update including DNL788 and DNL758.

“Together with our partner Sanofi, we have decided to pause clinical studies with DNL747 and focus our efforts on accelerating development of DNL788, which we believe has superior drug properties and a more rapid path toward proof-of-concept clinical studies in patients in multiple neurological indications,” said Ryan Watts, Ph.D., CEO. “We’d like to thank all patients who took part in these studies. Your participation is critical in the ultimate success of developing medicines for these terrible diseases.”

RIPK1, receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1, is a critical signaling protein in the TNF receptor pathway, which regulates inflammation and cell death in tissues throughout the body.

Data from 31 patients in two 29-day Phase 1b studies in Alzheimer’s disease and ALS, and additional data from six ALS patients in an open label extension study, showed that DNL747 was safe and well tolerated at the dose tested with no significant treatment related adverse events. Target engagement of approximately 80% median inhibition of pRIPK1 in blood at trough drug concentration was achieved.

In parallel to the clinical studies, chronic toxicity studies with DNL747 in cynomolgus monkeys showed dose- and duration-dependent adverse preclinical findings at exposures higher than those tested in the clinic. These findings, which are considered off-target and molecule-specific, impact the ability to increase the dose of DNL747 and achieve higher levels of target inhibition without time consuming additional clinical safety studies in patients to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability.

“Due to emerging evidence that higher levels of target inhibition may be required for maximizing efficacy, and challenges to achieving higher doses imposed by molecule-specific toxicity findings with DNL747, we are pausing additional studies with this molecule,” said Carole Ho, M.D., Chief Medical Officer. “However, I am encouraged by the emerging pathway biomarker data in Alzheimer’s disease and ALS patients, and our experience and learnings with DNL747 should allow us to progress quickly with clinical studies for DNL788. Importantly, DNL788 appears to have a superior preclinical therapeutic window compared to DNL747, facilitating development in multiple indications, including Alzheimer’s disease, ALS and multiple sclerosis.”

Data from the completed Phase 1 study with peripherally-restricted RIPK1 inhibitor DNL758 in healthy volunteer subjects display an encouraging profile, as the molecule appears safe and tolerable at doses tested. Denali partner Sanofi is responsible for development of DNL758 and is currently planning further clinical studies in multiple indications based on successful Phase 1 data.

 The approval of Ziextenzo and Riximyo expands Sandoz’s oncology biosimilar portfolio. The approval reinforces Sandoz’ status as the leading biosimilar and generic pharmaceutical company in Canada","Ziextenzo is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-neoplastic drugs.
Riximyo® is indicated to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis.
These two approvals mark an important milestone for Sandoz Canada, bringing its biosimilars into oncology at a time when its biopharmaceutical portfolio already included products in immunology and endocrinology.
BOUCHERVILLE, Quebec, June 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sandoz Canada Inc., a division of Novartis AG, announced today that Health Canada has approved Ziextenzo® (pegfilgrastim, reference biologic drug: Neulasta®) and Riximyo® (rituximab, reference biologic drug: Rituxan®) for marketing in Canada.

Sandoz Canada received a Notice of Compliance from Health Canada on April 21, 2020, for the use of Ziextenzo® to reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia, one of the most serious side effects of chemotherapy. Riximyo® was approved on April 28, 2020, to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis.

Neutropenia is a decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, which predisposes the body to infections and prevents it from fighting them¹.

According to statistics published by the Canadian Cancer Society², in 2019 an estimated 21,000 Canadians received a blood cancer diagnosis, which makes up approximately 10% of all cancer diagnoses and includes non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (10,000) and leukemia (6,700). Survival rates for blood cancers have increased over the years, but they still caused the deaths of 7,200 Canadians in 2016, according to a report released by The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada³.

“These two new approvals are great news for patients, their physicians and the Canadian healthcare system. The use of biosimilars allows more patients to benefit from the advantages of biologic therapies while helping to reduce growing costs to the healthcare system and generate savings that can be reinvested in healthcare resources,” says Michel Robidoux, President and CEO of Sandoz Canada. “The approvals of Ziextenzo® and Riximyo® expand our portfolio of biosimilars in oncology. They also reinforce our status as the leading biosimilar and generic pharmaceutical company in Canada, which relies on our strong experience in these areas, our commitment to reliable supply and the excellence of our patient service programs.”

Sandoz Canada’s biosimilars portfolio includes biologic drugs covering the therapeutic areas of oncology, rheumatology, immunology and endocrinology.

A biosimilar biologic drug, or biosimilar, is a biologic drug that has been shown to be similar to a brand-name drug already authorized for sale (referred to as a reference biologic drug). Biosimilars may become commercially available following the expiry of patents and data protection periods of the reference biologic drug. They have the potential to improve access to effective treatments while reducing the current economic burden on the Canadian healthcare system, patients, physicians and taxpayers as a whole4.

“Sandoz, a division of Novartis, is a world leader in the field of biosimilars. The company invests in research and development to improve patients’ quality of life and liberate healthcare resources through increased access to affordable biosimilars. With the Novartis group fully integrated end-to end model, we proudly ensure the reliable development, manufacture and supply of our full biosimilars portfolio in compliance with the industry’s highest quality standards”, says Karine Matteau, Vice President, Bio-Generic Hospital/Physician channel and Head Biosimilars at Sandoz Canada. “Sandoz markets eight biosimilar drugs worldwide and we look forward to count five of them in Canada within the next twelve months.”

34552,AstraZeneca Plans to Advance the Combination of Neutralizing Antibody for COVID-19 into Clinical in Next Two Months,Advancing our discovery of novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies against COVID-19,"AstraZeneca has licensed Vanderbilt University’s coronavirus-neutralizing Abs & plans to advance a pair of these mAbs into clinical development as a combination therapy for COVID-19. The agreement follows AstraZeneca and Vanderbilt collaboration in Apr’20
 AstraZeneca has evaluated the ability of 1,500+ mAbs to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibit its capacity to infect healthy cells in a laboratory setting. Based on pre-clinical results, the company has signed an exclusive license to six Abs currently in Vanderbilt’s portfolio targeting COVID-19. 2 out of 6 mAbs will progress into clinical evaluation as a combination approach within the next 2mos.
 Additionally, AstraZeneca has signed an interagency agreement with DARPA and BARDA to support the development of mAb against COVID-19 including P-I clinical study and the manufacturing of the investigational product for testing in P-I","Furthering the advancement towards the discovery of novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies to prevent and treat the progression of COVID-19, AstraZeneca has signed new agreements with academia and US government agencies and confirms plans to progress a combination approach consisting of a pair of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

New agreements with academia and US government agencies

AstraZeneca has licensed coronavirus-neutralising antibodies from Vanderbilt University, US, and plans to advance a pair of these mAbs into clinical development as a potential combination therapy for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. This agreement builds on the Company’s collaboration agreement with Vanderbilt, announced in April 2020.

Following rapid mobilisation of its global research efforts, AstraZeneca has evaluated the ability of more than 1,500 mAbs to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibit its capacity to infect healthy cells in a laboratory setting. Based on these pre-clinical results, the Company has signed an exclusive license to six candidate antibodies currently in Vanderbilt’s portfolio that target the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Two mAbs from these six will progress into clinical evaluation as a combination approach within the next two months.

AstraZeneca has also signed an interagency agreement with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the US Department of Defense, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the US Department of Health and Human Services, to support the company’s efforts to develop a mAb treatment against SARS-CoV-2, including a Phase I clinical trial and the manufacturing of the investigational product for testing in Phase I.

By combining two monoclonal antibodies that bind to distinct parts of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into what potentially could be a single preventative therapy, we hope to improve its effectiveness in neutralising the virus. These collaborations help ensure potential medicines that can prevent or treat COVID-19 are accelerated as quickly and safely as possible.

Mene PangalosExecutive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D

Monoclonal antibodies: a promising approach against COVID-19

mAbs mimic natural antibodies. It is hoped that an antibody-based treatment could neutralise the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus, in theory, be given as a preventative option for those exposed to the virus, as well as to treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected by the virus. It also has the potential to provide immediate effect in the patient.

A possible future antibody-based treatment could potentially be used as a preventative approach for COVID-19 and could be complementary to vaccines, e.g. for people who may not be able to have a vaccination or to provide added protection for high-risk populations. In addition, we plan to evaluate our monoclonal antibody combination candidate as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19.

The spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the primary target being explored for potential COVID-19 mAbs. The spike protein is responsible for binding and fusing the virus to the host cell membrane. The aim is that by targeting the spike protein, the antibody will be able to neutralise the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by affecting its capacity to infect healthy cells.

There are three key areas on the spike protein for which researchers around the world are exploring antibody-based treatments: the receptor binding domain, the N-terminal domain and the stem.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
 
AstraZeneca plans to progress a combination approach consisting of two mAbs that bind to distinct parts on the receptor binding domain. It is anticipated that the combination approach may increase the efficacy of the treatment and reduce the impact of any mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The mAbs will also have an extended half-life, engineered using proprietary technology to extend their longevity in the body.

Part of a comprehensive COVID-19 response

AstraZeneca’s comprehensive response to the COVID-19 global pandemic also includes a landmark agreement with the University of Oxford for the global development and distribution of the University’s potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2. The Company has also quickly moved to test new and existing medicines from multiple therapy areas to treat the infection.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AstraZeneca-11.jpg,Biotech|COVID-19,Astrazeneca,Neutralizing Antibody,COVID-19|Biotech|advance|Against|antibody|combination|Neutralizing,publish,6/10/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/advancing-our-discovery-of-novel-coronavirus-neutralising-antibodies-against-covid-19/,https://pharmashots.com/34552/astrazeneca-plans-to-advance-the-combination-of-neutralizing-antibody-for-covid-19-into-clinical-in-next-two-months/

Companies establish a discovery research collaboration to create additional differentiated antibody therapeutics for cancer
AbbVie to pay Genmab an upfront payment of USD 750 million with total potential milestone payments of up to USD 3.15 billion
Copenhagen, Denmark and North Chicago, Illinois; June 10, 2020 – Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) announced today that Genmab and AbbVie have signed a broad collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize three of Genmab’s early-stage investigational bispecific antibody product candidates and enter into a discovery research collaboration for future differentiated antibody therapeutics for cancer. The companies will partner to develop Genmab’s next-generation bispecific antibody programs, epcoritamab (DuoBody®-CD3xCD20), DuoHexaBody®-CD37 and DuoBody-CD3x5T4. The collaboration combines Genmab’s world-class discovery and development engine and next-generation bispecific antibody therapeutic candidates with AbbVie’s deep clinical expertise, innovative antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) platform and global commercial leadership in hematological cancers.

The discovery research collaboration will combine proprietary antibodies from both companies along with Genmab’s DuoBody technology and AbbVie’s payload and ADC technology to select and develop up to four additional differentiated next-generation antibody-based product candidates, potentially across both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Genmab’s DuoBody-CD3 technology engages and directs cytotoxic T cells selectively to tumors to elicit an immune response towards malignant tumor cells. AbbVie’s ADC technology allows the delivery of a therapeutic toxin directly to cancer cells while sparing normal, healthy cells, providing for a more targeted, less toxic treatment approach.

“This transformative collaboration will allow us to accelerate, broaden and maximize the development of some of our promising early-stage bispecific antibodies, including epcoritamab, with the ultimate goal of bringing these potential therapies much faster to cancer patients,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. “Today’s announcement marks the beginning of a new journey for Genmab that combines our world-class knowledge in antibody biology and deep expertise in truly innovative next-generation antibody technology platforms, with AbbVie’s R&D prowess and their leadership position in hematological cancers.”

“Epcoritamab is a strong fit for our robust hematological oncology franchise”, said Michael Severino, M.D., Vice Chairman and President, AbbVie. “By combining the strengths of our two organizations, we can advance the treatment landscape for patients battling cancer.”

Collaboration Details
This collaboration will provide for the joint development and commercialization of the three bispecific antibody therapeutic candidates. For epcoritamab, the companies will share commercial responsibilities in the U.S. and Japan, with AbbVie responsible for further global commercialization. Genmab will book net sales in the U.S. and Japan and receive tiered royalties on remaining global sales. For DuoHexaBody-CD37, DuoBody-CD3x5T4 and any product candidates developed as a result of the companies’ discovery research collaboration, Genmab and AbbVie will share responsibilities for global development and commercialization in the U.S. and Japan. Genmab retains the right to co-commercialize these products, along with AbbVie, outside of the U.S. and Japan. For the discovery research partnership, Genmab will conduct Phase 1 studies for these programs. AbbVie retains the right to opt-in to program development.

Except for these royalty-bearing sales, the parties share in pre-tax profits from the sale of products on a 50:50 basis. Included in these potential milestones are up to USD 1.15 billion in payments related to clinical development and commercial success across the three existing bispecific antibody programs. In addition, if all four next-generation antibody product candidates developed as a result of the discovery research collaboration are successful, Genmab is eligible to receive up to USD 2.0 billion in option exercise and success-based milestone payments.

As a result of this agreement, Genmab is improving its financial guidance for 2020.

OUTLOOK

(DKK million) Revised Guidance Previous Guidance
Revenue 9,100 – 9,500 4,750 – 5,150
Operating expenses (3,850) – (3,950) (3,850) – (3,950)
Operating income 5,200 – 5,600 850 – 1,250
Revenue
We expect our 2020 revenue to be in the range of DKK 9,100 – DKK 9,500 million, an increase of DKK 4,350 million compared to our previous guidance. The increase is due to nearly 90% of the USD 750 million upfront payment from this agreement being recognized immediately with the remainder being recognized over a number of years. The other elements of our original revenue guidance remain unchanged and are primarily related to DARZALEX royalties of DKK 4,075 – 4,475 million. Such royalties are based on estimated DARZALEX net sales of USD 3.9 – 4.2 billion. We project cost reimbursement income of approximately DKK 475 million which is related to our collaborations with Seattle Genetics and BioNTech. The remainder of our revenue is approximately DKK 200 million and consists of milestones and other royalties.

Operating Expenses
We anticipate our 2020 operating expenses will continue to be in the range of DKK 3,850 – 3,950 million. From the execution date of the agreement, our operating costs will include 50% of the costs for epcoritamab, DuoHexaBody-CD37 and DuoBody-CD3x5T4 and 100% of the costs for the discovery research collaboration. We expect that the reduction in our operating costs due to partner contribution to the existing clinical programs will be offset by increased investment to further expand and accelerate the partnership programs.

Operating Result
We now expect our operating income to be approximately DKK 5,200 to DKK 5,600 million in 2020.

In addition to factors already mentioned, the estimates above are subject to change due to numerous reasons, including but not limited to the achievement of certain milestones associated with our collaboration agreements; the timing and variation of development activities (including activities carried out by our collaboration partners) and related income and costs; DARZALEX sales and corresponding royalties to Genmab; and currency exchange rates (the 2020 guidance assumes a USD/DKK exchange rate of 6.5). The financial guidance assumes that no significant new agreements are entered into during 2020 that could materially affect the results.

About Epcoritamab (DuoBody-CD3xCD20)
Epcoritamab (DuoBody-CD3xCD20) is a bispecific antibody created using Genmab’s proprietary DuoBody technology. Epcoritamab is designed to target CD3, which is expressed on T cells and is part of the T cell receptor signaling complex, and CD20, a clinically well validated therapeutic target. CD20 is expressed on a majority of B cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In a number of laboratory models, epcoritamab has shown highly effective killing of CD20+ tumors and induced potent tumor cell lysis across a panel of B cell tumor lines. Epcoritamab is currently evaluated in a Phase 1/2 study for multiple hematological B cell malignancies.

Complete dose escalation data for epcoritamab was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program. The data and preliminary activity from the Phase 1/2 study of subcutaneous epcoritamab in patients with relapsed / refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) are highly encouraging showing substantial single-agent activity for epcoritamab with a manageable safety profile. In the study, epcoritamab induced rapid and deep responses in heavily pretreated patients with B-NHL across different subtypes and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed.

June 09, 2020 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
PORTLAND, Ore.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–UbiVac, Inc. (www.ubivac.com) today announced it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of UbiVac’s investigational product, DPV-001™, a first-in-class cancer vaccine that exploits autophagy, in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb’s anti-OX40 (BMS-986178) combined with sequenced administration of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo (nivolumab). The Phase 1b multicenter trial will test the hypothesis that combination immunotherapy with the DPV-001 cancer vaccine and anti-OX40 will augment anticancer immunity in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer.

“UbiVac is thrilled to be working with Bristol Myers Squibb, a world leader in immuno-oncology, to research this innovative cancer vaccine therapy, combined with anti-OX40 and checkpoint blockade, and evaluate whether this treatment boosts anticancer immunity in patients with advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer”

Triple Negative Breast Cancer is negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and HER2 receptors, and therefore treatment options are limited. This type of breast cancer tends to metastasize frequently, and occur in younger patients (less than 50 years of age) and those with the inherited BRCA1 mutation.

This is the first clinical trial to combine a cancer vaccine (DPV-001), that educates the immune system to destroy cancer cells, with a T cell agonist, Bristol Myers Squibb’s anti-OX40 (BMS-986178), that amplifies immune system activity. Patients also will receive anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint therapy, Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, which takes the brakes off the immune system.

“UbiVac is thrilled to be working with Bristol Myers Squibb, a world leader in immuno-oncology, to research this innovative cancer vaccine therapy, combined with anti-OX40 and checkpoint blockade, and evaluate whether this treatment boosts anticancer immunity in patients with advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer,” said Bernard A. Fox, PhD., President and CEO of UbiVac and the Harder Family Chair for Cancer Research at the Earle A. Chiles Research Institute and Providence Cancer Institute. The trial will be led by David Page, MD, at Providence Portland Medical Center and enroll patients in Portland and at other centers in the U.S. “I am excited to lead this first-in-human trial, which builds on 25 years of immunotherapy research from the Earle A. Chiles Research Institute,” said Dr. Page. “We believe that cutting-edge immunotherapy combinations have the potential to induce long-lasting anticancer immunity and translate into clinical responses in patients with triple negative breast cancer.”

About UbiVac’s Innovative Cancer Vaccine Technology

The lead biologic, DRibble Platform Vaccine 001, DPV-001, is a dendritic cell-targeted microvesicle containing short-lived proteins that are thought to represent the dominant HLA-presented epitopes on the surface of cancer cells. These microvesicles are packaged with multiple TLR and NOD agonists, together with 15 DAMPs and chaperones. The microvesicle vaccine also contains more than 100 proteins that are overexpressed by the average triple negative breast cancer and as many as 1700 altered peptide ligands that can augment immunity against cancer antigens. Together this formulation drives B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as innate components of the host’s immune system to mediate anticancer function.

In preclinical models this vaccine can convert tumors that are considered “cold” because they lack immune cells into tumors that are “hot” with cancer killer cells. This is important as many human tumors are thought to be unresponsive to immunotherapy because they lack immune cells capable of recognizing their cancer and are considered to be “cold” tumors. “Based on these data we believe UbiVac’s DRibble platform vaccine technology combined with anti-OX40 will light a fire in the immune system of patients with cold tumors, turning them into hot tumors that will be more responsive to checkpoint blockade,” Hong-Ming Hu, PhD, CSO at UbiVac, said.

About UbiVac

UbiVac is a privately held, clinical stage immunotherapy company engaged in the research and development of therapeutic vaccines to combat cancer. With innovative, first-in-class platform technology that couples an off-the-shelf DC-targeted cancer vaccine with more than 100 cancer antigens for most adenocarcinomas and squamous cell cancers, UbiVac believes it is highly complementary to current and developing drug portfolios. UbiVac also has a pipeline of vaccines under development to target COVID-19, rare diseases and to prevent cancer in patients at high risk of developing disease. Founded by Dr. Bernard A. Fox, Dr. Hong-Ming Hu and Mr. Bernard A. Fox, in Portland, Oregon in 2005, UbiVac is a spinout of the Robert W. Franz Cancer Center, Earle A. Chiles Research Institute at Providence Portland Medical Center. In 2011 UbiVac, in cooperation with Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), created UbiVac CMV to license sdCMV.

The CE marking strengthen its presence in the lucrative glucose monitoring market and boost its product portfolio
 The Dexcom G6 utilizes small, wearable sensor and transmitter to continuously measure and send glucose levels wirelessly to a receiver or compatible smart device, giving patients real-time glucose data without pricking their finger. In patients, patients aged ≤17yrs. can also wear their device on the upper buttocks
 The system also offers customizable alerts and alarms to help avoid fluctuating blood sugar events. In Feb’ 20, Dexcom G6 CGM System has received the CE Mark for use during pregnancy in the EU and expected to be made available in UK in Spring 2020","DexCom, Inc. DXCM recently announced that the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) System has obtained CE Marking across Europe for attaching on the back of the upper arm, thereby offering patients more choice when it comes to comfortably wearing their device. This development is likely to not only strengthen its presence in the lucrative glucose monitoring market but also boost product portfolio.

Notably, the FDA approved Dexcom G6 CGM System allows patients to know their glucose data and indications, which helps in making treatment decisions without the need of fingersticks and calibration.

Benefits of the Development

This new option will now enable all patients in Europe (over the age of two) to wear their Dexcom G6 on the back of the upper arm or the abdomen. In fact, patients till the age of 17 can also wear their device on the upper buttocks.



The CE Marking comes as a breakthrough development for all Dexcom G6 users, thereby highlighting the company’s commitment toward innovation with respect to diabetes management.

Another Development

In February, DexCom — the leader in CGM — made an announcement that the Dexcom G6 CGM System has received the CE Mark for use during pregnancy in the European Union. It will be made available soon starting with the United Kingdom in Spring 2020.

Pregnant women with Type 1, Type 2 or gestational diabetes can face serious problems (both for the mother and child) if the glucose levels are not monitored and controlled closely. With the solutions for diabetes management during pregnancy being limited, the CE Mark for the Dexcom G6 offers more choice for both healthcare professionals and patients to manage the disease.

Market Prospects

Per a report by Grand View Research, the global CGM device market size was valued at $3.93 billion in 2019 and is estimated to witness a CAGR of 12.7% during the forecast period (2020-2027). Rising cases of diabetes and higher adoption of CGM devices have been driving the market.

 An interim analysis will be conducted when ~100 patients have been evaluated for 1EPs. The study will be conducted in clinical sites across Russia and other EU countries. Additionally, RedHill is initiating P-IIa study with opaganib in the US","The multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical study of opaganib for severe COVID-19 patients is planned to be conducted in Russia and additional European and other countries

—
In parallel, a Phase 2a clinical study of opaganib for severe COVID-19 patients is being initiated in the U.S.

TEL-AVIV, Israel and RALEIGH, N.C., June 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (Nasdaq: RDHL) (“RedHill” or the “Company”), a specialty biopharmaceutical company, today announced that it has submitted a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) with the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation for a Phase 2/3 clinical study evaluating opaganib (Yeliva®, ABC294640)1 in patients hospitalized with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19) and pneumonia.

Mark L. Levitt, M.D., Ph.D., Medical Director at RedHill, said: “We are moving rapidly to advance our development program with opaganib for COVID-19. We are expanding the development program to Russia and additional countries, in parallel with the U.S. clinical study, in order to accelerate the collection of robust data on the potential efficacy of opaganib against COVID-19.”

The multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 study is planned to enroll 270 subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring hospitalization and treatment with supplemental oxygenation. Subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either opaganib or placebo, on top of standard-of-care therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the proportion of patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation by day 14. An unblinded futility interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 100 subjects have been evaluated for the primary endpoint.

The study is planned to be conducted in clinical sites across Russia and additional European and other countries.

In parallel, RedHill is initiating enrollment for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical study with opaganib in the U.S. This study is set to enroll up to 40 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring hospitalization and supplemental oxygenation. This clinical trial is not powered for statistical significance.

Gilead Raday, RedHill’s Chief Operating Officer, added: “We are working closely with government agencies worldwide to allow more patients access to opaganib through clinical studies and compassionate use programs, and are also evaluating governmental funding opportunities for our COVID-19 development programs to address the urgent need for effective therapies.”

A total of 141 subjects have been dosed with opaganib to date in ongoing and completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies in oncology indications, in pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers in the U.S., under the existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved expanded access requests for oncology patients and under the expanded access for COVID-19 patients in Israel, establishing safety and tolerability in humans both in the U.S. and ex-U.S.

The Company previously announced encouraging preliminary findings from six COVID-19 patients requiring high-flow supplemental oxygenation treated with opaganib in Israel under compassionate use. All six patients analyzed demonstrated pronounced clinical improvement following treatment initiation with opaganib, substantial improvement in biomarkers including decreased required supplemental oxygenation, higher lymphocyte counts and decreased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. All six patients analyzed were weaned from supplemental oxygen and discharged from the hospital on room air without having to receive mechanical ventilation.

About Opaganib (ABC294640, Yeliva®)
Opaganib, a new chemical entity, is a proprietary, first-in-class, orally-administered, sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2) selective inhibitor with anticancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities, targeting multiple oncology, inflammatory and gastrointestinal indications. By inhibiting SK2, opaganib blocks the synthesis of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid-signaling molecule that promotes cancer growth and pathological inflammation.

Pre-clinical data have demonstrated both anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities of opaganib, with the potential to reduce lung inflammatory disorders, such as pneumonia, and mitigate pulmonary fibrotic damage. Several prior pre-clinical studies support the potential role of SK2 in the replication-transcription complex of positive-strand single-stranded RNA viruses, similar to coronavirus, and its inhibition may potentially inhibit viral replication. Pre-clinical in vivo studies2 have demonstrated that opaganib decreased fatality rates from influenza-virus infection and ameliorated Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced lung injury by reducing the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids.

Opaganib was originally developed by U.S.-based Apogee Biotechnology Corp. and completed multiple successful pre-clinical studies in oncology, inflammation, GI and radioprotection models, as well as a Phase 1 clinical study in cancer patients with advanced solid tumors.

Opaganib received Orphan Drug designation from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma and is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2a in advanced cholangiocarcinoma and in a Phase 2 study in prostate cancer. Opaganib is also being evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus (COVID-19).

The development of opaganib has been supported by grants and contracts from U.S. federal and state government agencies awarded to Apogee Biotechnology Corp., including from the NCI, BARDA, the U.S. Department of Defense and the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development.

Opdivo is associated with the following Warnings and Precautions including immune-mediated: pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, skin adverse reactions, encephalitis, other adverse reactions; infusion-related reactions; embryo-fetal toxicity; and increased mortality in patients with multiple myeloma when Opdivo is added to a thalidomide analogue and dexamethasone, which is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.1 Please see the Important Safety Information section below.

“Many cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed at the advanced stage, when the disease could have a significant impact on a patient’s health.3 Treatment options can be limited once patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progress,”2,4 said Adam Lenkowsky, general manager and head, U.S., Oncology, Immunology, Cardiovascular, Bristol Myers Squibb. “The approval of Opdivo as a new treatment option for previously treated patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, regardless of PD-L1 expression, highlights our commitment to providing new options to address the unmet needs of patients and brings us another step closer to understanding the full potential of immunotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers.”1,2,5,6,7

About ATTRACTION-3

ATTRACTION-3 (NCT02569242) is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, open-label global study evaluating Opdivo versus taxane chemotherapy (investigator’s choice of docetaxel or paclitaxel) in patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, refractory or intolerant to at least one prior fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based regimen. 1,2 The trial included patients regardless of tumor PD-L1 status, but tumor specimens were evaluated prospectively using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay at a central laboratory.1

The trial excluded patients who were refractory or intolerant to taxane therapy, had brain metastases that were symptomatic or required treatment, had autoimmune disease, used systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants or had apparent tumor invasion of organs adjacent to the esophageal tumor or had stents in the esophagus or respiratory tract.1 Patients were randomized to receive Opdivo 240 mg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (n=210) or investigator’s choice of taxane chemotherapy (n=209) of either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n=65), or paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 intravenously once a week for 6 weeks followed by 1 week off (n=144).1,2 Patient enrollment occurred predominantly in Asia, with the United States and Europe accounting for the remainder.2 Patients were treated until disease progression, assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), or unacceptable toxicity.1

The major efficacy outcome measure was OS.1 Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 and duration of response (DOR).1 There was no statistically significant difference between the two arms for ORR (19.3% [33/171, 95% CI: 13.7 to 26.0] versus 21.5% [34/158, 95% CI: 15.4 to 28.8] for Opdivo (0.6% complete response [CR] and 18.7% partial response [PR]) and investigator’s choice chemotherapy (1.3% CR and 20.3% PR), respectively; p=0.6323).1 The median PFS was 1.7 months (95% CI: 1.5 to 2.7) for Opdivo versus 3.4 months (95% CI: 3.0 to 4.2) for investigator’s choice chemotherapy (HR 1.1; 95% CI: 0.9 to 1.3), however it was not tested due to the pre-specified hierarchical testing strategy.1 This trial was sponsored by Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. of Japan, Bristol Myers Squibb’s development partner for Opdivo.8

Select Safety Profile from ATTRACTION-3

The safety of Opdivo was evaluated in ATTRACTION-3 in 209 patients.1 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients receiving Opdivo.1 Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients who received Opdivo were pneumonia, esophageal fistula, interstitial lung disease and pyrexia. The following fatal adverse reactions occurred in patients who received Opdivo: interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (1.4%), pneumonia (1.0%), septic shock (0.5%), esophageal fistula (0.5%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), pulmonary embolism (0.5%), and sudden death (0.5%).1 Opdivo was discontinued in 13% of patients and was delayed in 27% of patients for an adverse reaction.1 The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥20% of Opdivo-treated patients were rash (22%) and decreased appetite (21%).1

About Esophageal Cancer

In the United States, it is estimated that approximately 18,440 new cases of esophageal cancer will be diagnosed and approximately 16,170 deaths will result from the disease this year alone.9 Esophageal cancer is a type of gastrointestinal cancer that starts in the inner layer of the esophagus (the mucosa) and grows.10 The mucosa is normally lined with squamous cells, and cancer starting in these cells is called squamous cell carcinoma, and accounts for less than 30% of esophageal cancers in the United States.10 For about 25% of patients, the disease is diagnosed in the advanced stage, which is typically harder to treat.3,7

Indication

OPDIVO® (nivolumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) after prior fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based chemotherapy.

The recommended dosage of OPDIVO for this indication is 240 mg IV infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks or 480 mg IV infusion over 30 minutes every 4 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.1

OPDIVO (10 mg/mL) is an injection for intravenous (IV) use.1

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and for symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or more severe pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold until resolution for Grade 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, fatal cases of immune-mediated pneumonitis have occurred. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 (of more than 5 days duration), 3, or 4 colitis. Withhold OPDIVO monotherapy for Grade 2 or 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 or recurrent colitis upon re-initiation of OPDIVO. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Addition of an alternative immunosuppressive agent to the corticosteroid therapy, or replacement of the corticosteroid therapy, should be considered in corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis if other causes are excluded.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater transaminase elevations. Withhold OPDIVO for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for Grade 3 or 4. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (35/1994) of patients.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency, autoimmune thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis, signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, thyroid function prior to and periodically during treatment, and hyperglycemia. Administer hormone replacement as clinically indicated and corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hypophysitis. Withhold for Grade 2 or 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 hypophysitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 3 or 4 adrenal insufficiency. Withhold for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 adrenal insufficiency. Administer hormone-replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Initiate medical management for control of hyperthyroidism. Withhold OPDIVO for Grade 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 hyperglycemia.

In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (12/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, hypothyroidism or thyroiditis resulting in hypothyroidism occurred in 9% (171/1994) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 2.7% (54/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, diabetes occurred in 0.9% (17/1994) of patients.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grades 2-4 increased serum creatinine. Withhold OPDIVO for Grade 2 or 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 increased serum creatinine. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction occurred in 1.2% (23/1994) of patients.

Immune-Mediated Skin Adverse Reactions

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some cases with fatal outcome. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 3 or 4 rash. Withhold for Grade 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 rash. For symptoms or signs of SJS or TEN, withhold OPDIVO and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment; if confirmed, permanently discontinue. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated rash occurred in 9% (171/1994) of patients.

Immune-Mediated Encephalitis

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated encephalitis. Evaluation of patients with neurologic symptoms may include, but not be limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Withhold OPDIVO in patients with new-onset moderate to severe neurologic signs or symptoms and evaluate to rule out other causes. If other etiologies are ruled out, administer corticosteroids and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for immune-mediated encephalitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, encephalitis occurred in 0.2% (3/1994) of patients. Fatal limbic encephalitis occurred in one patient after 7.2 months of exposure despite discontinuation of OPDIVO and administration of corticosteroids.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.

If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.

Infusion-Related Reactions

OPDIVO can cause severe infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in <1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on mechanism of action, OPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for at least 5 months after the last dose.

Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone

In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.

Lactation

It is not known whether OPDIVO is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from OPDIVO, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 5 months after the last dose.

Serious Adverse Reactions

In Attraction-3, serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=209). Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients who received OPDIVO were pneumonia, esophageal fistula, interstitial lung disease and pyrexia. The following fatal adverse reactions occurred in patients who received OPDIVO: interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (1.4%), pneumonia (1.0%), septic shock (0.5%), esophageal fistula (0.5%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), pulmonary embolism (0.5%), and sudden death (0.5%).

Common Adverse Reactions

In Attraction-3, the most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥20% of OPDIVO-treated patients (n=209) were rash (22%) and decreased appetite (21%).

34653,"Celltrion to Evaluate Remsima (biosimilar, infliximab) Against COVID-19 in the UK",First drugs announced in major COVID-19 drugs trial,"Celltrion collaborates with the University of Oxford and University Hospitals Birmingham to study the efficacy of Remsima (CT-P13) as a potential treatment for COVID-19
 UHB will test a series of new drugs in a CATALYST trial. If the CATALYST study indicates benefit CT-P13 it would then be assessed in larger-scale studies in one of the UK national platform trials RECOVERY or REMAP-CAP
 Additionally, UHB will evaluate Izana Bioscience’s Namilumab (IZN-101) which is a mAb in a late-stage studies for RA and ankylosing spondylitis","Two UK drugs companies will be the first to partner with the Universities of Birmingham and Oxford as part of a major new UK drugs trial to test potential therapeutics to treat patients hospitalised with COVID-19.

In what could be a significant development in the fight against the virus the CATALYST trial, which is a collaboration with University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB), will test a series of new drugs, including those already in use for patients with cancer and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Designed by the Inflammation – Advanced and Cell Therapy Trials Team (I-ACT) at the University of Birmingham’s Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, the trial is being run in close partnership with UHB and the Birmingham National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR BRC) and delivered in close collaboration with the Oxford and University College London NIHR BRC’s.

Oxford based biopharmaceutical company Izana Bioscience will provide the first of four potential treatments to be tested. Namilumab (IZN-101) is a fully human monoclonal antibody already in late-stage trials to treat rheumatoid arthritis and an inflammatory disease called ankylosing spondylitis. It targets a ‘cytokine’ called GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor), which is naturally secreted by immune cells in the body but, in uncontrolled levels, is believed to be a key driver of the excessive and dangerous lung inflammation seen in COVID-19 patients.

The second drug, Infliximab (CT-P13) developed by Slough based Celltrion Healthcare UK, is an anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy that is designed to attach to a protein involved in inflammation and is currently used as a treatment other inflammatory conditions including eight autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome under the trade name Remsima®.

It is hoped that by using drugs that target the most serious symptoms of the virus, the severity of the disease could be reduced leading to a reduction in the number of patients needing to be admitted to intensive care and ultimately, a reduction in virus related deaths.

Dr Ben Fisher, co-clinical investigator of the CATALYST trial from the University of Birmingham’s Institute of Inflammation and Ageing and Consultant Rheumatologist at UHB said: “There has been a tremendous effort to pull together this initiative so rapidly. Emerging evidence is demonstrating a critical role for anti-inflammatory drugs in the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19 infection. In the CATALYST study we hope to show with a single dose of these kinds of drugs in hospitalised patients, that we are able to delay or prevent the rapid deterioration into intensive care and requirement for invasive ventilation in this critical patient group.”

“We hope that by using a treatment that is already used to treat inflammation in other autoimmune conditions we may be able to manage inflammation associated with COVID-19 early,” said Sir Marc Feldmann, Professor of Immunology, University of Oxford. “If, when people are initially admitted to hospital, we are able to keep symptoms within manageable levels, this may reduce the number of patients who need to be admitted to intensive care”.

Dr Someit Sidhu, Chief Executive and Co-founder of Izana Bioscience, said: “We are proud to be supporting the CATALYST trial led by the highly experienced team at the University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham, Europe’s largest integrated critical care centre. We believe namilumab can play a significant role in dampening the hyper-inflammation seen in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and are committed to working with regulators and partners across the world to ensure this potential therapy can be developed for patients with COVID-19 who urgently need treatments. This is a particularly significant moment for me, supporting the global response to this pandemic through the work of the team at University Hospitals Birmingham – the hospital where I trained as a junior doctor before going on to found Izana”

Dr Dan Casey, Medical Advisor at Celltrion Healthcare UK said: “We’re eager to put our wealth of expertise and heritage in the treatment of inflammation towards tackling the COVID-19 outbreak. CT-P13 has been used for several years in the treatment of inflammatory conditions which makes it a good candidate for trialling in the treatment of COVID-19 due to its widespread availability and well-established safety profile”.

The trials exciting new adaptive trial design allows for more rapid testing of each drugs effectiveness, with up to 40 patients recruited to each arm. The effect of each drug will be measured by the amount of oxygen in the blood as well as using other severity indicators of the disease (i.e organ failure). Drugs that show reductions in the amount of oxygen needed by the patient and in other severity measures will be recommended for further testing within large ongoing national trials.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/celltrion-2.jpg,Biosimilars,Celltrion,Remsima | infliximab,COVID-19|Biosimilar|Against|Britain|Celltrion|Evaluate,publish,6/11/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/first-drugs-announced-in-major-covid-19-drugs-trial/,https://pharmashots.com/34653/celltrion-to-evaluate-remsima-biosimilar-infliximab-against-covid-19-in-the-uk/

The transaction will not impact Novo Nordisk’s previously communicated operating profit outlook for 2020. Novo Nordisk will fund the upfront payment from financial reserves and the ongoing share buyback programme will not be impacted.

The acquisition of Corvidia Therapeutics and its lead candidate, ziltivekimab, is aligned with Novo Nordisk’s strategy to expand its presence across a range of cardiometabolic diseases that are closely linked to Novo Nordisk’s core business within diabetes and obesity. Ziltivekimab is being evaluated in a phase 2b dose-finding clinical trial in patients who have an increased risk of ASCVD with CKD and inflammation.

“We believe that ziltivekimab has the potential to become a first- and best-in-class treatment to lower the burden of cardiovascular disease in a patient population that is at high risk of major adverse cardiovascular events,” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk.

”This acquisition recognises the important scientific work Corvidia has been doing over the last five years in cardio-renal diseases with a focus on inflammation,” said Marc de Garidel, chief executive officer of Corvidia Therapeutics. “In Novo Nordisk, we have found a partner that has deep expertise in cardiometabolic disease, a proven track record of success in conducting cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOT), and the infrastructure to accelerate the development of ziltivekimab in order to help patients who need it most.”

The transaction is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary conditions.

Novo Nordisk was represented by Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP as legal advisor. Corvidia Therapeutics was represented by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as exclusive financial advisor and Goodwin Procter LLP as legal advisor.

About ziltivekimab

Ziltivekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6, with extended half-life technology. Ziltivekimab has completed two early-stage trials in chronic kidney disease patients where ziltivekimab administered at low doses reduced the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation.

Ziltivekimab is currently in an ongoing phase 2b trial (RESCUE) to evaluate ziltivekimab as a once-a-month subcutaneous injection in patients with CKD stage 3-5 and high levels of CRP. RESCUE is designed as a dose-finding trial to enable a global phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial to assess the impact of ziltivekimab on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a patient population with elevated cardiovascular risk.

About the INSTRIDE Studies
The INSTRIDE 1 and INSTRIDE 2 studies were randomized, confirmatory clinical trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mylan’s proposed insulin glargine, MYL-1501D, versus branded insulin glargine, Lantus. INSTRIDE 1 was a 52-week noninferiority study in 558 T1DM patients, while INSTRIDE 2 was a 24-week study in 560 T2DM (including insulin-naïve) patients. In both studies, patients were randomized to receive either once daily MYL-1501D or Lantus and the primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints included glycemic endpoints like change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose and insulin dose, as well as safety endpoints like systemic reactions, device-related safety issues and immunogenicity. The safety, efficacy and immunogenicity data from these studies in T1DM and T2DM patients indicated that there were no differences in the Semglee and Lantus arms.

Important Safety Information
Semglee is a long-acting human insulin analog indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Do not use during episodes of hypoglycemia or if hypersensitive to insulin glargine or it’s excipients. Patients should be instructed to never share the prefilled pen even if the needle is changed. Changes to a patient’s insulin regimen should be done under close supervision with increased blood glucose monitoring as hyper- or hypoglycemia may occur. Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction with insulin, including Semglee and it may be life-threatening. Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Medication errors can result from accidental mix-ups among insulin products. Instruct patients to always check the insulin label before administration. Severe, life-threatening generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis can occur with insulin products, including Semglee. If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Semglee and treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. Monitor potassium levels for hypokalemia. Fluid retention and heart failure have been reported with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones and Semglee.

Completed enrollment of younger adults in the Phase 2 study of mRNA-1273 (n=300); also completed enrollment of the sentinel group of older adults (n=50)

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Jun. 11, 2020– Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced progress on late-stage development of mRNA-1273, the Company’s mRNA vaccine candidate against COVID-19.

Moderna has finalized the Phase 3 study protocol based on feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The randomized, 1:1 placebo-controlled trial is expected to include approximately 30,000 participants enrolled in the U.S. and is expected to be conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The trial’s primary endpoint will be the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease; key secondary endpoints include prevention of severe COVID-19 disease (as defined by the need for hospitalization) and prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The primary efficacy analysis will be an event-driven analysis based on the number of participants with symptomatic COVID-19 disease. Based on the results of the Phase 1 study, the 100 μg dose level was chosen as the optimal dose level to maximize the immune response while minimizing adverse reactions. Moderna has completed manufacture of vaccine required to start the Phase 3 study. The Company expects dosing in the Phase 3 study to begin in July.

With the Phase 3 dose being finalized at 100 μg, the Company remains on track to be able to deliver approximately 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, beginning in 2021 from the Company’s internal U.S. manufacturing site and strategic collaboration with Lonza.

“We look forward to beginning our Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273 with some 30,000 participants in July,” said Tal Zaks, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at Moderna. “Moderna is committed to advancing the clinical development of mRNA-1273 as safely and quickly as possible to demonstrate our vaccine’s ability to significantly reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease.”

The first cohort of healthy adults ages 18-54 years (n=300) in the Phase 2 study of mRNA-1273 is fully enrolled, 13 days after the first participant was dosed. The sentinel participants in the cohort of older adults ages 55 years and above (n=50) is fully enrolled. This Phase 2 study, being conducted by Moderna, is evaluating the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two vaccinations of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart. The Company intends to enroll 600 healthy participants across two cohorts of adults ages 18-54 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300). Each participant will be assigned to receive placebo, a 50 μg or a 100 μg dose at both vaccinations. Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination.

On May 6, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed its review of the Company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for mRNA-1273 and on May 11, the FDA granted it Fast Track designation. On May 18, Moderna announced initial data from the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 led by NIAID. The Phase 1 study is ongoing with the original cohorts in long-term follow-up and enrollment in 9 of 12 cohorts complete. The NIH will be submitting the Phase 1 data to a peer-reviewed clinical publication.

Funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), partially supported the planning for the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of mRNA-1273 and is supporting the execution of these studies, as well as the manufacturing process scale-up of mRNA-1273. Moderna will also fund costs required to complete the development of mRNA-1273 including portions of the Phase 3 study and the scale up of manufacturing capacity at the final established dosage in order to obtain licensure for mRNA-1273. A summary of the company’s work to date on COVID-19 can be found here.

About mRNA-1273

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was selected by Moderna in collaboration with investigators from Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing.

About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality

Moderna scientists designed the company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. More than 1,600 participants have been enrolled in Moderna’s infectious disease vaccine clinical studies under health authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across Phase 1 studies, the company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has nine development candidates in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

Vaccines against respiratory infections

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults (mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1172 or V172 with Merck)
RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)
COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273)
Influenza H7N9 (mRNA-1851)
Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647)
Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA)
Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189)
To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for seven prophylactic vaccines (H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3, CMV and Zika). Moderna’s CMV vaccine is currently in a Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna’s investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.

 The company anticipates the filing of 351(k) biosimilar application for its biosimilar insulin glargine candidate by the end of 2022
 Lannett/HEC’s insulin glargine is a biosimilar to Sanofi’s Lantus (the reference biologic) and met its PK/PD safety endpoints in its study","PHILADELPHIA, June 11, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE: LCI) today said that representatives from the company spoke with and received guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the clinical advancement program of its biosimilar insulin glargine partnered product candidate. Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin used to treat adults with Type 2 diabetes, as well as adults and pediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes, for the control of high blood sugar. Total U.S. sales of the glargine related products, according to IQVIA, were approximately $9.5 billion for the 12 months ending April 2020, although actual biosimilar market values are expected to be lower.

“At the Biosimilar Biological Product Development (BPD) Type II meeting held earlier this week the FDA provided positive feedback on the clinical and CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls) advancement of our biosimilar insulin glargine that was consistent with our expectations,” said Tim Crew, chief executive officer of Lannett. “Our path forward is clear with regard to what is expected in the planned 351(k) biosimilar application, which we anticipate will be filed in calendar year 2022. We will work with our strategic partner to complete all the necessary development activity, including human clinical trials, in accordance with FDA’s guidance.”

Crew added, “Biosimilar insulin glargine represents a significant opportunity for Lannett, given the notably large addressable market. Moreover, we believe only a relatively small number of competitors have the technical expertise and requisite resources to develop and manufacture such a complex product.”

The company previously announced positive results from the first human study evaluating insulin glargine that Lannett is developing with its strategic alliance partners within the HEC Group of companies (HEC). The trial confirmed that the Lannett/HEC biosimilar insulin glargine was biosimilar to US-approved Lantus® (the reference biologic) in terms of meeting all pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) safety endpoints in the study.

Lantus® is a registered trademark of Sanofi S.A.

First studies evaluate safety and efficacy in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19

Two-antibody ‘cocktail’ is designed to help protect against viral escape

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced initiation of the first clinical trial of REGN-COV2, its investigational dual antibody cocktail for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The REGN-COV2 clinical program will consist of four separate study populations: hospitalized COVID-19 patients, non-hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 patients, uninfected people in groups that are at high-risk of exposure (such as healthcare workers or first responders) and uninfected people with close exposure to a COVID-19 patient (such as the patient’s housemate). The placebo-controlled trials will be conducted at multiple sites.

“We have created a unique anti-viral antibody cocktail with the potential both to prevent and treat infection, and also to preempt viral ‘escape,’ a critical precaution in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “REGN-COV2 could have a major impact on public health by slowing spread of the virus and providing a needed treatment for those already sick – and could be available much sooner than a vaccine. The antibody cocktail approach may also have long-term utility for elderly and immuno-compromised patients, who often do not respond well to vaccines. Ultimately, the world needs multiple solutions for COVID-19, and the innovative biopharma industry is collectively working hard to help as many people as possible with a variety of complementary approaches.”

Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company’s proprietary VelocImmune® mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies isolated from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. They selected the two most potent, non-competing and virus-neutralizing antibodies and have scaled them up for clinical use with the company’s in-house VelociMab® and manufacturing capabilities. The two antibodies bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus’s spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment, as demonstrated in upcoming Science publications of preclinical research.

Regeneron used the same ‘rapid response’ capabilities and cocktail approach to develop REGN-EB3, a novel triple antibody treatment for Ebola that is now under regulatory review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). REGN-COV2’s preclinical development and preclinical/clinical manufacturing has been funded in part with federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

The first two adaptive Phase 1/2/3 studies are evaluating REGN-COV2 (REGN10933+REGN10987) as a treatment for hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The Phase 1 portion will focus on virologic and safety endpoints, and the Phase 2 portion will focus on virologic and clinical endpoints. Data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies will be used to refine the endpoints and determine size for the Phase 3 studies.

“We are particularly excited to begin studies of REGN-COV2, which is a novel antibody cocktail targeted specifically against SARS-CoV-2,” said trial investigator Dr. Suraj Saggar, Chief of Infectious Disease at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey. “Over the last long months, we have learned that repurposing existing medicines unfortunately does not offer a broadly effective solution for COVID-19. For this reason, we need to investigate custom-designed approaches like REGN-COV2. The first studies will evaluate if REGN-COV2 can improve disease outcomes in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19.”

About Regeneron’s Anti-Viral Antibodies
When faced with a harmful pathogen, such as a virus or bacteria, the human immune system typically produces antibodies to fight the invader. Specifically, the immune system produces ‘anti-viral’ antibodies that recognize, bind, and kill or neutralize the virus. Vaccination involves injecting a dead or weakened virus, or a critical small piece of a virus, to induce this protective immune response, resulting in the same antibodies the immune system would typically make in a person who actually had the infectious disease.

Regeneron’s core technologies allow for rapid and efficient generation of these protective anti-viral antibodies outside of the body, derived from either genetically-humanized mice or convalescent humans. The resulting antibodies correspond to the most potent of anti-viral antibodies that could be elicited by a vaccine or through exposure to a pathogen. These antibodies can be delivered to people via injection, providing “passive immunity” and protection from the disease immediately, though they must be re-administered to remain effective over time. These antibodies can also treat an existing infection, unlike vaccines which can only be used preventatively.

The concept that drug cocktails can prevent viral escape has previously been demonstrated for traditional antiviral drugs used to treat HIV and other viruses. In the upcoming Science publications, Regeneron scientists report the fundamental realization that this can also be true for antibody-based therapies. Regeneron’s preclinical studies demonstrate that, in the setting of a single therapeutic antibody that blocks the ability of a virus to infect healthy cells, spontaneously arising mutant forms of the virus are able to ‘escape’ or evade the antibody’s blocking action. These mutants are then ‘selected’ (i.e., are able to survive and proliferate despite the single antibody treatment) and may ultimately become the dominant strain of the virus. Regeneron therefore pursues a multi-antibody cocktail approach designed to decrease the potential for the virus to escape.

Regeneron has developed additional technologies that allow for the large-scale manufacturing and purification of these anti-viral antibodies, potentially allowing many people to be granted immunity before vaccines become widely available.

June 11, 2020 07:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time
OSAKA, Japan–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to divest a portfolio of select non-core over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription pharmaceutical products sold exclusively in Asia Pacific to Celltrion Inc. (“Celltrion”), an Incheon, South Korea-based biopharmaceutical company specializing in the research, development and manufacturing of small molecules, biosimilars and innovative drugs. Takeda will receive $266 million USD upfront in cash and up to an additional $12 million USD in potential milestone payments, subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions.

“Across our Growth & Emerging Markets, Takeda must focus on accelerating the commercial availability of our highly innovative medicines for patients living with complex and rare conditions, and expanding our approach to Access to Medicines across the Region”

The portfolio to be divested to Celltrion includes a variety of OTC products and pharmaceutical products in the Cardiovascular, Diabetes and General Medicine therapeutic areas sold predominantly in Australia, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, which are part of Takeda’s Growth & Emerging Markets Business Unit. The portfolio generated FY 2018 net sales of approximately $140 million USD, driven by strong sales of prescription products Nesina® and Edarbi®. While the products included in the sale continue to play important roles in meeting patient needs in these countries, they are outside of Takeda’s chosen business areas – Gastroenterology (GI), Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology and Neuroscience – that are core to its global long-term growth strategy.

“Across our Growth & Emerging Markets, Takeda must focus on accelerating the commercial availability of our highly innovative medicines for patients living with complex and rare conditions, and expanding our approach to Access to Medicines across the Region,” said Ricardo Marek, President, Growth & Emerging Markets Business Unit, Takeda. “Doing so, better addresses patient unmet needs. While we remain committed to Asia Pacific, and the Emerging Markets, divesting non-core products helps achieve those goals.”

“This announcement marks continued progress on our commitment to divest non-core products as we remain focused on maintaining our financial discipline and rapid deleveraging following our acquisition of Shire,” said Costa Saroukos, Chief Financial Officer, Takeda. “One of several transactions since the launch of the divestment program, the sale announced today will further focus Takeda on our five key business areas and our pipeline of innovative medicines. We look forward to continuing to execute and deliver on Takeda’s financial commitments, including paying down debt and focusing our portfolio.”

Takeda has made strong progress on its ongoing divestiture program. In March 2020, Takeda completed sales of non-core assets spanning the Russia-CIS region to STADA for $660 million USD and in countries spanning the Near East, Middle East and Africa region to Acino for $200 million USD. In July 2019, Takeda completed the divestiture of Xiidra® to Novartis for up to $5.3 billion USD. Additionally, earlier this year, Takeda announced the sales of non-core products in Latin America to Hypera Pharma for $825 million USD and in Europe to Orifarm Group for up to approximately $670 million USD, including the sale of two manufacturing sites in Denmark and Poland.

Takeda intends to use the proceeds from its divestitures to continue to reduce its debt and accelerate deleveraging toward its target of 2x net debt/adjusted EBITDA within March 2022 – March 2024.

Transaction Details

Takeda has entered into an agreement to sell a portfolio of 18 select OTC and prescription pharmaceutical assets sold in Australia, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand to Celltrion for a total value of up to $278 million USD. Takeda will receive $266 million USD upfront in cash and up to an additional $12 million USD in potential milestone payments, subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions.

Takeda and Celltrion have also entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement under which Takeda will continue to manufacture the portfolio of divested products and supply them to Celltrion. Under the terms of the agreement, Celltrion will acquire the rights, title and interest to the products in the portfolio exclusive to these countries.

The transaction is expected to close by end of the calendar year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, receipt of required regulatory clearances and, where applicable, compliance with local works council requirements. Until then, Takeda remains the owner of these products and responsible for ensuring patient access to them.

Takeda is being advised by BofA Securities as its financial advisor and White & Case is its legal advisor in this transaction.

The system utilizes SmartGuard algorithm and stabilizes blood sugar levels and further improves glucose control
 The MiniMed 780G system enables the personalization of glucose goals with an adjustable target setting as low as 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L). The system automates the delivery of both basal insulin and correction boluses every 5mins. to help diabetic patients avoid highs and lows in blood sugar
 Additionally, the Bluetooth connectivity of the system enables user’s real-time glucose data and trends on compatible iOS and Android smartphones via apps. The company expects to launch MiniMed 780G system in select European countries in H2’20","Next Generation Closed Loop Insulin Pump System Features 
Auto-Correction Algorithm and Bluetooth Connectivity

DUBLIN, June 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced CE (Conformité Européenne) Marking of its MiniMed™ 780G system, a next generation closed loop insulin pump system for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in people age 7 to 80 years. Leveraging the company’s most advanced SmartGuard™ algorithm, the system automates the delivery of both basal insulin and correction boluses every five minutes to help people with diabetes avoid highs and lows with greater ease. The MiniMed 780G system enables the personalization of glucose goals with an adjustable target setting as low as 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) — lower than any other advanced hybrid closed loop system — and is designed to help stabilize blood sugar levels and further improve glucose control.

“We wanted to design a system that further simplifies diabetes management and adapts to people’s life with the goal of enhancing their experience in a seamless way,” said Sean Salmon, Executive Vice President and President of the Diabetes Group at Medtronic. “We know it can be challenging to have to calculate carbohydrate intake before every snack or meal on a daily basis to ensure the right amount of insulin is dosed. With this system, users will have an extra layer of coverage for those times they miscalculate their carbs or forget to pre-bolus with analgorithm that automatically corrects for high glucose when needed. We want to help people spend more time living their life and less time worrying about their diabetes management — we’re confident this system delivers on that important goal.”

Patients who participated in the clinical study provided feedback that the MiniMed 780G system “made life with diabetes and control so much easier” and that it made “life significantly easier.”

In addition to the automated algorithm which includes technology from DreaMed Diabetes, the MiniMed 780G system was designed to be easy to use by requiring less input from the user1. With the addition of Bluetooth® connectivity, the MiniMed 780G system will enable users and their care partners to see real-time glucose data and trends on compatible iOS and Android smartphones via apps. Additionally, healthcare providers will find that managing patients on the system is simple as there are only a few settings that need adjustment to enable optimal use of the technology.

“I am incredibly proud of the strong collaboration that resulted in this meaningful step forward with the MiniMed 780G system, which the clinical trial has demonstrated to be a beneficial tool for a wide range of patients and particularly adolescents,” said Professor Moshe Phillip, director of the Institute for Endocrinology and Diabetes, National Center of Childhood Diabetes, Schneider Children’s Medical Center of Israel, co-founder and chief science officer, DreaMed Diabetes. “By continuing to increase the automation of insulin pump systems, we can further reduce burden for people living with diabetes while simultaneously driving positive clinical outcomes.”

The system is expected to begin shipping this Fall in select countries in Europe. In the United States, the MiniMed 780G system is investigational use only and not approved for sale.

The data from three trials using the next generation advanced hybrid closed loop system from Medtronic will be presented in a symposium at the virtual 80th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association.

 Symposium: The Next Generation of Automated Insulin Delivery Systems for Persons with Type 1 Diabetes – Four New Clinical Trials
 June 12, 2:00 – 4:00 pm (CDT)
The MiniMed 780G system is part of the new Medtronic portfolio of insulin pumps with smartphone connectivityvia Bluetooth. Additional systems with CE Mark include the MiniMed™ 770G2 system which uses the same hybrid closed loop technology as the current MiniMed™ 670G system that is available in many parts of the world. There is also a MiniMed™ 720G3 system with CE Mark that provides readings from a Medtronic glucose sensor without automating any insulin delivery based off those readings. These MiniMed™ 700 series pumps will be made available in countries around the world based on local market approvals and regulations.

1 When the MiniMed 780G system is not using the SmartGuard feature, pump functions are operating in manual mode. In manual mode, the sensor glucose readings from Guardian™ Sensor 3 are not intended to be used directly for making therapy adjustments, but rather to provide an indication of when a finger stick/BG meter reading may be required. All therapy adjustments should be based on measurements obtained using a home glucose monitor and not on values provided by the Guardian™ Sensor 3 in manual mode.

34789,AstraZeneca To Supply 400M Doses of Vaccines to IVA by the End of 2020,AstraZeneca to supply Europe with up to 400 million doses of Oxford University’s vaccine at no profit,"AstraZeneca has signed an agreement with EU’s IVA, spearheaded by Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands, to supply up to 400M doses of the University of Oxford’s AZD1222, with deliveries starting by the end of 2020
 The collaboration allows IVA to accelerate the supply of the vaccine and to provide equitable access to all participating countries across the EU
 Additionally, AstraZeneca had signed a similar kind of agreement with US, UK, CEPI, GAVI for $700M doses, and collaborated with SII for 1B doses. Last month, Oxford University has initiated P- II/III UK trial of AZD1222 in ~10,000 adult volunteers","Company exploring further additional global
capacity to provide broad and equitable access
AstraZeneca has reached an agreement with Europe’s Inclusive Vaccines Alliance (IVA), spearheaded by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, to supply up to 400 million doses of the University of Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine, with deliveries starting by the end of 2020.

With today’s agreement, the IVA aims to accelerate the supply of the vaccine and to make it available to other European countries that wish to participate in the initiative. The IVA is committed to providing equitable access to all participating countries across Europe.

AstraZeneca continues to build a number of supply chains in parallel across the world, including for Europe. The Company is seeking to expand manufacturing capacity further and is open to collaborating with other companies in order to meet its commitment to support access to the vaccine at no profit during the pandemic.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “This agreement will ensure that hundreds of millions of Europeans have access to Oxford University’s vaccine following approval. With our European supply chain due to begin production soon, we hope to make the vaccine available widely and rapidly. I would like to thank the governments of Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands for their commitment and swift response.”

The Company has recently completed similar agreements with the UK, US, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi the Vaccine Alliance for 700 million doses, and it agreed a licence with the Serum Institute of India for the supply of an additional one billion doses, principally for low- and middle-income countries. Total manufacturing capacity currently stands at two billion doses.

Oxford University last month announced the start of a Phase II/III UK trial of AZD1222 in about 10,000 adult volunteers. Other late-stage trials are due to begin in a number of countries. AstraZeneca recognises that the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical programme with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk.

The Company’s comprehensive pandemic response also includes rapid mobilisation of AstraZeneca’s global research efforts to discover novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies to prevent and treat progression of the COVID-19 disease, with the aim of reaching clinical trials in the next three to five months. Additionally, the Company has quickly moved into testing of new and existing medicines to treat the infection, including the CALAVI trials underway for Calquence (acalabrutinib) and the DARE-19 trial for Farxiga (dapagliflozin) in COVID-19 patients.

Financial Considerations

Today’s announcement is not anticipated to have any significant impact on the Company’s financial guidance for 2020; costs to manufacture the vaccine are anticipated to be offset by funding by governments.

AZD1222

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, now known as AZD1222, was developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, working with the Oxford Vaccine Group. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold (adenovirus) virus that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack COVID-19 if it later infects the body.

The recombinant adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1) was chosen to generate a strong immune response from a single dose and it is not replicating, so cannot cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual. Vaccines made from the ChAdOx1 virus have been given to more than 320 people to date and have been shown to be well tolerated, although they can cause temporary side effects such as a temperature, influenza-like symptoms, headache or a sore arm.

AstraZeneca

AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three therapy areas – Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism, and Respiratory & Immunology. Based in Cambridge, UK, AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide.

free until another pharmaceutical product or vaccine is approved for the treatment or
prevention of COVID 19 by the USFDA or EMA or the WHO announcing the end of the
public health emergency. Zydus will leverage its ability to scale up production to reach
patients across India and across the 127 countries in Gilead’s Global Patient Solution region.
Remdesivir is an investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity
both in vitro and in vivo in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens,
including Ebola, Marburg, MERS and SARS. In vitro testing conducted by Gilead has
demonstrated that Remdesivir is active against the virus that causes COVID-19. The safety
and efficacy of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 are being evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase
3 clinical trials.
Remdesivir must be administered intravenously. Under this EUA, the 10-day dosing duration
is suggested for patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the 5-day dosing duration is suggested for patients not
requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO. If a patient on the 5-day dosing
duration does not demonstrate clinical improvement after five days, treatment may be
extended for up to five additional days (10 days total).

The study enrolled its first patient last month & assesses the efficacy and safety of the baricitinib + remdesivir (4mg, qd) vs remdesivir","– Study Will Further Understanding of Baricitinib’s Potential as a COVID-19 Treatment – Data Will Complement Ongoing NIAID Trial and Investigator-Initiated Trials

INDIANAPOLIS, June 15, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced today that the first patient has been enrolled in a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo–controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib, an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor licensed from Incyte, in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Baricitinib, marketed as OLUMIANT®, is approved in 70 countries as a treatment for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Lilly expects to enroll 400 patients in the trial, with data expected in the next few months. The study will be conducted in the U.S., Europe and Latin America and includes patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have at least one elevated marker of inflammation but do not require invasive mechanical ventilation at study entry.

In COVID-19 infection, increased disease severity can be associated with a hyperinflammatory state. It is hypothesized that through JAK1 and JAK2 inhibition, baricitinib may reduce the cytokine storm associated with the complications of this infection. In addition, baricitinib may have a role in inhibiting the host cell proteins that assist in viral reproduction, reducing the ability of infected cells to make more virus. A manuscript detailing this mechanism of action of baricitinib in COVID-19 has been accepted for publication by EMBO Molecular Medicine.

The primary endpoint for Lilly’s study is the proportion of patients who die or require non-invasive ventilation/high-flow oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation by Day 28 in patients treated with 4 mg of baricitinib daily (with background therapy) compared to placebo (with background therapy). Patients will receive baricitinib or placebo for up to 14 days or until discharge from the hospital. Key secondary outcomes of this study include the proportion of patients with clinical improvement at different time points, time to recovery, duration of hospitalization, number of ventilator-free days and mortality over a 28-day period.

“Lilly is committed to fighting this global pandemic, and this includes testing whether existing medicines including baricitinib could help treat the complications of COVID-19 in patients,” said Patrik Jonsson, Lilly senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. “This randomized controlled study is an important step in our understanding of baricitinib as a potential COVID-19 treatment.”

“While the approach to addressing COVID-19 continues to evolve, we’re pleased to partner with Lilly in this trial to assess baricitinib’s potential in the fight against COVID-19 and look forward to learning more about its impact on patients,” said Patrick Milligan, M.D., of Community Health Network in Indianapolis, U.S., one of the first sites participating in the study.

“Following upon the success of remdesivir to treat moderate to severe COVID-19, hospitalized patients are still in need of novel approaches to reduce mortality,” said Vincent C. Marconi, M.D., professor of medicine and global health at Emory University School of Medicine and Emory’s Rollins School of Public Health. “Several ongoing studies with baricitinib will provide necessary data about this treatment that may combine antiviral activity with suppression of cytokine storm.”

The data from Lilly’s trial will complement data from the study of baricitinib with remdesivir in the second phase of the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This study – which enrolled its first patient last month – assesses the efficacy and safety of the combination of a 4-mg daily dose of baricitinib plus remdesivir, compared to remdesivir.

Lilly is also supporting select ongoing multisite and single-site investigator-initiated trials in Europe and North America for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections. These studies by academic and government institutions will provide information on hundreds of additional patients treated with baricitinib and either placebo or active comparators.

Should research efforts for baricitinib in COVID-19 prove successful, Lilly will continue to create adequate supply to support both appropriate clinical and investigational use.

Studying baricitinib in controlled trials is important in order to better characterize its potential benefits and understand the safety of its use as a COVID-19 treatment. The U.S. prescribing information for the approved use of baricitinib for RA includes boxed warnings regarding the use of baricitinib, including warnings about risk for developing blood clots and serious infections.

About Lilly’s COVID-19 Efforts
Lilly is bringing the full force of its scientific and medical expertise to attack COVID-19 around the world. We are fighting the pandemic with everything we can: discovering potential medicines to treat and prevent COVID-19, maintaining a reliable supply of our medicines, and supporting patients and communities in times of need. Lilly is studying multiple approaches to treat COVID-19, including potential antibodies designed specifically to attack the virus and existing Lilly medicines to understand their potential in treating complications of COVID-19.

Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients
OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS 

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:
Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to ≥5x and ≥10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse reactions (≥1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

About OLUMIANT®
OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies, and approved outside of the U.S. for patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs.i There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.ii OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.i

In December 2009, Lilly and Incyte announced an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of baricitinib and certain follow-on compounds for patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expanded indication for GARDASIL9 for the prevention of oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. The oropharyngeal and head and neck cancer indication is approved under accelerated approval based on effectiveness in preventing HPV-related anogenital disease. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. The trial is currently underway.

“At Merck, working to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers has been a priority for more than two decades,” said Dr. Alain Luxembourg, director, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “Today’s approval for the prevention of HPV-related oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers represents an important step in Merck’s mission to help reduce the number of men and women affected by certain HPV-related cancers.”

GARDASIL 9 is a vaccine indicated in females 9 through 45 years of age for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; and genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11.

GARDASIL 9 is indicated in males 9 through 45 years of age for the prevention of anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; anal precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; and genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11.

GARDASIL®9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant) is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast, or after a previous dose of GARDASIL 9 or GARDASIL® [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant].

Both men and women can be at risk for HPV-attributable oropharyngeal cancer; however, this cancer affects men five times more than women.1 For most people, HPV clears on its own. But, for those who don’t clear the virus, it can cause certain cancers. Oropharyngeal cancer can arise as a result of HPV infection in the oropharynx, which includes the soft palate, side and back wall of the throat, tonsils, and back one-third of the tongue. According to a recent model published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV-attributable oropharyngeal cancer has surpassed cervical cancer as the most prevalent type of HPV-related cancer in the U.S.1

1 The CDC analyzed data from the U.S. Cancer Statistics (USCS) to assess the incidence of HPV-associated cancers and to estimate the annual number of cancers caused by HPV, overall and by state, during 2012 to 2016.

The estimated number of HPV-attributable cancers was calculated by multiplying the average number of HPV-associated cancers by the percentage of HPV-attributable cancers diagnosed from 1993 to 2005, before HPV vaccination was available in the U.S.

The detection of HPV DNA in an HPV study is not enough to determine that HPV caused the cancer.

Not all cervical and oropharyngeal cancers are caused by HPV.

Important Information About GARDASIL 9

GARDASIL 9 does not eliminate the necessity for vaccine recipients to undergo screening for cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers as recommended by a healthcare provider.

GARDASIL 9 has not been demonstrated to provide protection against diseases caused by:

HPV types not covered by the vaccine
HPV types to which a person has previously been exposed through sexual activity
Not all vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers are caused by HPV, and GARDASIL 9 protects only against those vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.

GARDASIL®9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant) is not a treatment for external genital lesions; cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers; or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN), or anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN).

Vaccination with GARDASIL 9 may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.

Select Safety Information for GARDASIL 9

GARDASIL 9 is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast, or after a previous dose of GARDASIL 9 or GARDASIL® [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant].

Because vaccinees may develop syncope, sometimes resulting in falling with injury, observation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic movements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported following HPV vaccination. When syncope is associated with tonic-clonic movements, the activity is usually transient and typically responds to restoring cerebral perfusion.

Safety and effectiveness of GARDASIL 9 have not been established in pregnant women.

The most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions in females were injection-site pain, swelling, erythema, and headache. The most common (≥10%) local and systemic reactions in males were injection-site pain, swelling, and erythema.

The duration of immunity of GARDASIL 9 has not been established.

Dosage and Administration for GARDASIL 9

GARDASIL 9 should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid or anterolateral area of the thigh.

For individuals 9 through 14 years of age, GARDASIL 9 can be administered using a 2-dose or 3-dose schedule. For the 2-dose schedule, the second dose should be administered 6-12 months after the first dose. If the second dose is administered less than 5 months after the first dose, a third dose should be given at least 4 months after the second dose. For the 3-dose schedule, GARDASIL 9 should be administered at 0, 2 months, and 6 months.
For individuals 15 through 45 years of age, GARDASIL 9 is administered using a 3-dose schedule at 0, 2 months, and 6 months.
About HPV and HPV-related Cancers and Diseases

According to the CDC, an estimated 14 million new HPV infections occur every year in the United States. HPV is so common that 80% of people who are sexually active get HPV at some point in their life. For most people, HPV clears on its own; but for those who don’t clear the virus, it could cause certain cancers and diseases. There is no way to know which people who have HPV will develop cancer or other health problems. GARDASIL®9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant) helps protect against seven HPV types that cause the majority of HPV-related cancers in the United States. Persistent HPV infection can also lead to pre-cancerous lesions that may require additional follow-up procedures. With the exception of cervical cancer, there is no routinely recommended screening for the detection of HPV-related cancers.

BOSTON, Mass – June 15, 2020 – Akili today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted clearance for EndeavorRxTM (AKL-T01) as a prescription treatment for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Delivered through a captivating video game experience, EndeavorRx is indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8-12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. See full indication below. Persistent attention issues have a significant impact on the daily lives of millions of people. Attention impairments are a key component of ADHD for many children yet are often overshadowed by more overt symptoms of ADHD.

 

EndeavorRx was reviewed through FDA’s de novo pathway and its clearance creates a new class of digital therapeutics. EndeavorRx is designed to directly target and activate neural systems through the presentation of sensory stimuli and motor challenges to improve cognitive functioning.

 

“We’re proud to make history today with FDA’s decision”, said Eddie Martucci, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Akili. “With EndeavorRx, we’re using technology to help treat a condition in an entirely new way as we directly target neurological function through medicine that feels like entertainment. Families are looking for new ways to help their children with ADHD. With today’s decision by FDA, we’re excited to offer families a first-of-its-kind non-drug treatment option and take an important first step toward our goal to help all people living with cognitive issues.”

 

EndeavorRx was granted clearance based on data from five clinical studies in more than 600 children diagnosed with ADHD, including a prospective, randomized, controlled study published in The Lancet Digital Health journal, which showed EndeavorRx improved objective measures of attention in children with ADHD. After four weeks of EndeavorRx treatment, one-third of children no longer had a measurable attention deficit on at least one measure of objective attention. Further, about half of parents saw a clinically meaningful change in their child’s day-to-day impairments after one month of treatment with EndeavorRx; this increased to 68% after a second month of treatment. Improvements in ADHD impairments following a month of treatment with EndeavorRx were maintained for up to a month.

 

“For children living with ADHD, improving their ability to focus and resist distraction is critical to their daily functioning and performance in school,” said Elysa Marco, M.D., cognitive and behavioral child neurologist and Clinical Executive for Neurodevelopmental Medicine at Cortica Healthcare. “Unlike traditional ADHD medications, EndeavorRx is designed to specifically target inattention. Based on the benefits my research participants and patients have experienced, I am thrilled that EndeavorRx is moving from the lab to the clinic to play an essential role as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for children with ADHD.”

 

The EndeavorRx treatment will be available with a prescription to families soon. Akili believes that cognitive impairments require the same constant attention and care as with any other chronic condition. EndeavorRx will be released as the centerpiece of the Endeavor Care Program, which includes the EndeavorRx treatment and Akili Care,TM a mobile tracking app and personal support services for caregivers. Easily accessible from home, EndeavorRx is downloaded from the App Store by families on their mobile devices and does not require any additional equipment.

 

“The clearance of EndeavorRx marks the culmination of nearly a decade of research and development and was fueled by the commitment of our team and collaborators to challenge the status quo of medicine. This would not have been possible without the dedication of our clinical research partners and hundreds of families who gave their time and energy to participate in our clinical trials,” said Scott Kellogg, senior vice president of medical devices at Akili.

 

For families who have accessed EndeavorRx through FDA’s COVID-19 enforcement discretion guidance, Akili is committed to a seamless transition for them to the prescription program as appropriate.

 

About EndeavorRx

EndeavorRx is built on the Akili Selective Stimulus Management engine (SSMETM) core technology, a proprietary technology designed for the targeted activation of specific neural systems in the brain to treat diseases with associated cognitive dysfunction. SSME presents specific sensory stimuli and simultaneous motor challenges designed to target and activate the neural systems that play a key role in attention function while using adaptive algorithms to personalize the treatment experience for each individual patient. This enables second by second monitoring of patient progress completing the treatment sessions, and continuously challenges each patient to an optimized level, encouraging patients to improve their performance. Driven by the core belief at Akili that effective medicine can also be fun and engaging, EndeavorRx is delivered through an action video game experience. The captivating experience of EndeavorRx is designed to drive engagement and compliance.

 

Clinical Evidence Supporting EndeavorRx

The EndeavorRx research program includes three studies in ADHD (STARS-ADHD, STARS-Adjunct and ADHD-POC) and two pilot studies in ADHD with different comorbidities (Sensory Processing Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder). The pivotal STARS-ADHD study was a multi-center, randomized, blinded, controlled study in 348 children diagnosed with ADHD, and results were recently published in The Lancet Digital Health journal. In the pivotal study, EndeavorRx showed a statistically significant improvement compared to an educational-style video game control (p=0.006) on a change in the Attention Performance Index (API) of the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®), a computerized test cleared by FDA to evaluate the effects of interventions in ADHD. In the STARS-Adjunct open-label study, statistically significant improvement was seen in the IRS (a parent-reported clinician-administered scale of ADHD impairments) from baseline to after 4-weeks of treatment in both children on stimulants and off any ADHD medication.No serious adverse events have been associated with EndeavorRx in any study to date. Some study participants (9.3%) experienced non-serious treatment-related adverse events with EndeavorRx, including frustration, headache, dizziness, emotional reaction, nausea or aggression.

 

EndeavorRx Indication for Use

EndeavorRx is indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8-12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. Patients who engage with EndeavorRx demonstrate improvements in a digitally assessed measure Tests of Variables of Attention (TOVA) of sustained and selective attention and may not display benefits in typical behavioral symptoms, such as hyperactivity. EndeavorRx should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include: clinician-directed therapy, medication, and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder.

June 14, 2020 08:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time
INCHEON, South Korea–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Data presented as part of the Virtual Edition of the 25th EHA Annual Congress (EHA25 Virtual Congress) show that a regimen of Truxima® (biosimilar rituximab), lenalidomide and acalabrutinib (R2A) may be well tolerated and effective in relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma.1 Lenalidomide and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors have shown potential in the treatment of aggressive B-cell lymphoma, and recent studies suggest both agents may be particularly effective in a subset of large B-cell lymphomas. The objective of this Phase II clinical trial was to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of the R2A regimen in relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma.1

Between the first enrolment in July 2019 and the data cut-off in February 2020, a total of 22 patients were treated with a median follow up of 3.2 months. The majority of patients (73%) had non-germinal centre B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (non-GCB DLBCL). In each cycle of treatment, patients were treated with rituximab 375mg/m2 day 1 intravenous injection, lenalidomide 20mg day 1 to day 21 once daily, and acalabrutinib 100mg day 1 to day 28 twice daily. Each cycle of treatment was delivered over 4 weeks (28 days), and each patient received 6 cycles. Acalabrutinib maintenance therapy was then given in responders for up to one year.1

The primary endpoint for this single arm, multicenter, investigator-initiated study was the overall response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoints included complete remission (CR) rate, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety profile. In the 13 patients who underwent disease assessment following the R2A regimen, objective response was observed in 69% of patients and CR was observed in 31% of patients. The 6-month PFS rate was 83% and only one patient experienced disease progression after the initial objective response.1

Throughout the study, out of 22 patients, dose reduction was performed in 3 and 1 patients for lenalidomide and acalabrutinib respectively due to haematologic toxicities. 3 patients experienced higher than grade 2 toxicity and the most common adverse event regardless of grade was skin toxicity, observed in 4 patients. The data indicate that the R2A regimen was therefore well tolerated in Korean relapse/refractory B-cell lymphoma patients, with initial analysis in non-GCB DLBCL patients showing a promising response.1

Combination regimens can improve patient outcomes, however, combining high-cost treatments can make the cost unsustainable. Payers are therefore increasingly looking for new pricing models and ways to manage the budget impact of combination treatments.2 The introduction of biosimilar rituximab to the R2A regimen may have the potential to reduce the overall cost of treatment.

Youngil Koh, Associate Professor at Seoul National University Hospital and principal investigator of the trial, said, “Despite the introduction of new drugs for the treatment of lymphoma, there has been rising concern over the cost of treatment. Biosimilars have the potential to explore better treatment regimens and increase access to novel drugs and new regimens. By incorporating biosimilar rituximab into combination therapies alongside new drugs, the overall cost burden can be reduced, enhancing patient access.”

Mr. Hyoung-Ki Kim, Vice Chairman at Celltrion Healthcare said, “There is a rising interest towards lenalidomide and acalabrutinib in the haematology community and Celltrion Healthcare is committed to continuing its innovative research into new regimens such as R2A combination therapy to support patient care.”

Recently, the WHO recognised the importance of access to rituximab and awarded prequalification to Truxima®, making this the first rituximab similar biotherapeutic product to be prequalified by the organisation.3 Mr Kim said, “The prequalification of this treatment marks another step forward in making this medicine available in many countries around the world as an affordable therapeutic option.”

Notes to Editors:

About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 4,5,6,7

There are more than 60 different subtypes of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), however diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are the most common subtype accounting for 30-40% of adult NHLs. Global epidemiological data is limited, however, it is thought that the incidence is 7 cases per 100,000 people.

DLBCL is an aggressive condition and it is common to find patients with advanced disease at the point of diagnosis. The most commonly exhibited symptom is one or more painless swellings, and other general symptoms include heavy sweating at night, high temperatures that arise with no obvious cause and weight loss. Of DLBCL patients, 30-40% are thought to relapse and 10% of patients have refractory disease. Patients with relapsed refractory DLBCL if left untreated have a life expectancy of 3 to 4 months.

About Truxima® (biosimilar rituximab)3,8

Truxima® is a mAb that targets CD20, a transmembrane protein found on the surface of most B-cells. By binding specifically to CD20, Truxima® depletes B-cells by three main mechanisms: Induction of apoptosis, stimulation of CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity) and stimulation of ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity). Truxima® approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis. Truxima® is the first rituximab similar biotherapeutic product to be prequalified by the World Health Organization (May 2020).

KENILWORTH, N.J. & NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), today announced the presentation of results from the Phase 3 VERTIS CV cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial that evaluated STEGLATRO (ertugliflozin), an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, versus placebo, added to background standard of care treatment, in more than 8,200 patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic CV disease across 531 centers in 34 countries. The study met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority on major adverse CV events (MACE), which is composed of a composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, compared to placebo.

“The VERTIS CV results add to the growing body of evidence regarding the clinical profile of ertugliflozin, including its safety in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease,” said Dr. Christopher P. Cannon, cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, the study’s lead author. “Although not a part of the hierarchical testing sequence, the results indicated the potential of ertugliflozin to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.”

Overall, the primary MACE outcome was reported in 11.9% (n=653) of patients treated with STEGLATRO (5 mg and 15 mg doses), compared with 11.9% (n=327) of patients treated with placebo (HR=0.97; 95.6% CI [0.85-1.11]; p<0.001 for non-inferiority). The key secondary endpoints of superiority for ertugliflozin versus placebo were not met. These key secondary endpoints included: time to the first occurrence of the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), time to CV death alone and time to the first occurrence of the composite of renal death, dialysis/transplant or doubling of serum creatinine. The pre-specified endpoint of HHF, while not a part of the hierarchical testing sequence, showed a 30% reduction in the risk of HHF for ertugliflozin versus placebo (2.5% vs. 3.6%; HR=0.70; 95% CI [0.54-0.90]).

“The results of the VERTIS CV trial are a significant and important addition to the overall evidence for the cardiovascular safety profile of ertugliflozin,” said Dr. Sam Engel, associate vice president, Merck clinical research, diabetes and endocrinology.

“We sincerely thank the patients and investigators for their participation in the VERTIS CV study and commitment to the clinical evaluation of ertugliflozin,” said Dr. James Rusnak, senior vice president and chief development officer, internal medicine, Pfizer Global Product Development.

The safety profile of STEGLATRO was consistent with that reported in previous studies.

STEGLATRO is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The results of VERTIS CV trial were presented today at the American Diabetes Association’s virtual 80th Scientific Sessions.

About VERTIS CV

The VERTIS CV (NCT01986881) trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, event-driven trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic CV disease. The primary endpoint of the study was non-inferiority on MACE, a composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, compared to placebo. The study was designed to evaluate CV safety (non-inferiority) to satisfy the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on demonstration of CV safety for novel anti-hyperglycemic agents in the pre-approval and post-approval time periods. The two doses of ertugliflozin were pre-specified to be pooled for assessment of cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

VERTIS CV enrolled 8,246 adults (40 years of age or older) with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic CV disease, including patients 65 years of age or older and those with renal impairment or heart failure. More than 99% of patients had established CV disease. Coronary artery disease was reported in 75.9% of patients, cerebrovascular disease in 22.9%, peripheral arterial disease in 18.7%, and history of heart failure in 23.7%. Enrolled patients were randomized to receive ertugliflozin 5 mg (n=2,752), ertugliflozin 15 mg (n=2,747) or placebo (n=2,747) once-daily, added to background standard of care treatment at 531 centers in 34 countries. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.5 years and the mean study drug treatment period was 2.9 years for ertugliflozin and 2.8 years for placebo.

Key secondary endpoints included superiority versus placebo on time to the composite of CV death or HHF, CV death alone and the composite of renal death, dialysis/transplant or doubling of serum creatinine. A hierarchical testing sequence was used across the primary and key secondary hypotheses for the pooled ertugliflozin group versus placebo. Other secondary efficacy outcomes that were not part of the hierarchical statistical testing sequence, but were pre-specified in the protocol, included time to first occurrence of: MACE plus (MACE or hospitalization for unstable angina), fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, individual components of MACE and all-cause death.

Indications and Usage for STEGLATRO (ertugliflozin)

STEGLATRO (ertugliflozin) is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. STEGLATRO is not recommended in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Selected Safety Information for STEGLATRO (ertugliflozin)

Contraindications: STEGLATRO is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease, or on dialysis, and/or a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to ertugliflozin.

Hypotension: STEGLATRO causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating STEGLATRO, particularly in patients with impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients (≥65 years), patients with low systolic blood pressure, or patients on diuretics. Before initiating STEGLATRO, volume status should be assessed and corrected if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy.

Ketoacidosis: Ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization, has been reported in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes receiving sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), including STEGLATRO. Some cases were fatal. Assess patients with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue STEGLATRO, evaluate, treat promptly, and ensure risks for ketoacidosis are resolved prior to restarting. Before initiating, consider risk factors. Consider temporarily discontinuing STEGLATRO for at least 4 days prior to scheduled surgery. Monitor patients and temporarily discontinue STEGLATRO in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (eg, prolonged fasting due to acute illness or post-surgery). Educate patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis. Instruct patients to discontinue STEGLATRO and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function: STEGLATRO causes intravascular volume contraction and can cause renal impairment. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Before initiating STEGLATRO, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury. Consider temporarily discontinuing STEGLATRO in any setting of reduced oral intake or fluid losses; monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue STEGLATRO promptly and institute treatment.

STEGLATRO increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating STEGLATRO. Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiating STEGLATRO and periodically thereafter. Use of STEGLATRO is not recommended when eGFR is persistently between 30 and less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Cases of pyelonephritis also have been reported in patients treated with STEGLATRO in clinical trials. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated.

Lower Limb Amputations: An increased risk for lower limb amputation has been observed in clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. Across seven Phase 3 clinical trials with STEGLATRO, nontraumatic lower limb amputations were reported in 1 (0.1%) patient in the comparator group, 3 (0.2%) patients in the STEGLATRO 5-mg group, and 8 (0.5%) patients in the STEGLATRO 15-mg group. A causal association between STEGLATRO and lower limb amputation has not been definitively established. Before initiating STEGLATRO, consider factors that may predispose patients to the need for amputations. Monitor patients and discontinue STEGLATRO if complications occur. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care.

Hypoglycemia With Concomitant Use With Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Insulin and insulin secretagogues (eg, sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. STEGLATRO may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with STEGLATRO.

Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier’s Gangrene): A rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention has been reported in post-marketing surveillance in females and males with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with STEGLATRO presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue STEGLATRO, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

Genital Mycotic Infections: STEGLATRO increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients who have a history of genital mycotic infections or who are uncircumcised are more likely to develop genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat appropriately.

Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C): Dose-related increases in LDL-C can occur with STEGLATRO. Monitor and treat as appropriate.

Macrovascular Outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with STEGLATRO.

The most common adverse reactions associated with STEGLATRO (≥5%) were female genital mycotic infections.

IDEAYA Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: IDYA) and GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) announce a strategic partnership in Synthetic Lethality, an emerging field in Oncology.

The strategic partnership includes IDEAYA’s Synthetic Lethality programs MAT2A, Pol Theta, and Werner Helicase programs, which are projected to reach clinical trials within the next three years. IDEAYA has solved the crystal structures for each of its MAT2A, Pol Theta and Werner Helicase programs, enabling structure-based drug design, and has demonstrated in vivo proof of concept in relevant animal models for its MAT2A and Pol Theta programs.

Synthetic Lethality is one of four core research focus areas for GSK in oncology. In synthetic lethality, cells tolerate the loss of single genes in isolation but not together in combination. When tumor suppressor genes are functionally lost in cancer, this mode of action can be used to exploit tumor-specific vulnerabilities through new medicines for patients with cancer.

“GSK is the ideal strategic partner for IDEAYA, as this partnership enables compelling potential combinations and the opportunity to build the industry leading Synthetic Lethality pipeline that targets molecularly defined populations in several major solid tumors, including potentially lung, prostate, breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancer,” said Yujiro S. Hata, Chief Executive Officer and President, IDEAYA Biosciences.

IDEAYA will lead the MAT2A program through early clinical development. IDEAYA is responsible for all costs of the MAT2A program prior to the GSK option exercise. Thereafter, IDEAYA is responsible for 20% of global development costs.

IDEAYA will receive a 50% US profit share and ex-US royalties for the MAT2A and Werner Helicase programs and is responsible for 20% of global development costs for licensed products being developed with GSK. IDEAYA will receive global royalties for the Pol Theta program, and GSK will cover all research, development, and commercialization costs. GSK will be responsible for all commercialization activities and costs globally for licensed products. The collaboration agreement is conditional upon customary conditions including regulatory review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

35023,Novartis' Cosentyx (secukinumab) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Active Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis,Novartis Cosentyx receives FDA approval for new indication to treat active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis,"The approval is based on P-III PREVENT study assessing the safety and efficacy of Cosentyx (150mg with/out loading dose) vs PBO in 555 adult patients with active nr-axSpA that were biologic treatment naïve or had an inadequate response / were intolerant to an anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy (anti-TNFs)
 The P-III PREVENT study resulted in meeting its 1EPs i.e. 40% improvement in ASAS40 @52wks.; improvement in both load and without load arms @16wks. as assessed by ASQoL; @16wks. greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 PCS score & MCS score; no new safety signals were detected
 Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human biologic targeting IL-17A and has received EMA’s approval for nr-axSpA in Apr’2020","FDA approval for Cosentyx® is based on the Phase III PREVENT trial, demonstrating efficacy in active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), which is part of the axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) disease spectrum
There are an estimated 2.7M people living with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in the US; however, it remains significantly underdiagnosed1,2
nr-axSpA approval is the fourth indication for Cosentyx, which is backed by five years of clinical data supporting long-term safety and efficacy across moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)3-8
Basel, June 17, 2020 — Novartis, a leader in rheumatology and immuno-dermatology, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Cosentyx® (secukinumab) for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), confirming Cosentyx efficacy in addressing the axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) disease spectrum9.

“The results from the PREVENT trial show that there was a significant reduction in disease activity for patients treated with Cosentyx versus placebo,” said Atul Deodhar, MD, professor of medicine and medical director of Rheumatology Clinics at Oregon Health & Science University, and an investigator in the PREVENT clinical trial. “This approval brings a new therapeutic option to people living with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.”

The approval of Cosentyx for nr-axSpA is based on efficacy and safety outcomes from the PREVENT Phase III study, which included 555 adults with active nr-axSpA that were biologic treatment naïve or had an inadequate response / were intolerant to an anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy (anti-TNFs). Cosentyx met the primary endpoints achieving statistically significant improvements versus placebo in the signs and symptoms of nr-axSpA, as measured by at least a 40% improvement in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS40) response criteria in biologic-naïve individuals at week 5210.

nr-axSpA patients treated with Cosentyx showed improvement in both load and without load arms compared to placebo-treated patients at Week 16 in health-related quality of life as measured by the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) questionnaire (Least Squares mean change: Week 16: -3.5 and -3.6 -vs -1.8, respectively). General health status and quality of life was assessed by the Short Form health survey (SF-36). At Week 16, patients treated with Cosentyx showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) score and in the mental component summary (MCS) score10. The safety profile of Cosentyx in the PREVENT trial was shown to be consistent with previous clinical trials. No new safety signals were detected3-8,10.

nr-axSpA is part of the axSpA spectrum, which is characterized by inflammatory arthritis of the spine associated with chronic inflammatory back pain11. The axSpA disease spectrum also includes AS, in which joint damage is visible on x-ray, and nr-axSpA, in which joint damage is generally not visible on x-ray1,12. The physical limitations of axSpA can affect activities of daily living as well as leisure activities causing limitations for patients13,14.

“There is a need for additional treatment options. Having a new treatment option for the axSpA community is truly encouraging,” said Cassie Shafer, Chief Executive Officer of the Spondylitis Association of America. “Helping reduce the burden on people living with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis by improving symptoms that affect their daily lives remains a critical focus for the SAA.”

In April 2020, Novartis received European Medicines Agency approval of Cosentyx for the treatment of nr-axSpA15.

About Cosentyx (secukinumab)
Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human biologic that directly inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), an important cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nr-axSpA16,17. Cosentyx has been studied clinically for more than 13 years. The medicine is backed by robust investigational evidence, including five years of clinical data supporting long-term safety and efficacy across moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)3-8. These data strengthen the unique position of Cosentyx as a comprehensive treatment across axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriatic disease, supported by more than 340,000 patients treated worldwide since launch18-20.

About PREVENT
PREVENT is a two-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (with a two-year extension phase) to investigate the efficacy and safety of Cosentyx, in patients with active nr-axSpA. The study enrolled 555 male and female adult patients with active nr-axSpA (with onset before 45 years of age, spinal pain rated as ≥40/100 on a visual analog scale (VAS) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4) and who had been taking at least two different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the highest dose up to 4 weeks prior to study start. Patients may have previously taken a TNF inhibitor (not more than one) but had had an inadequate response. Of the 555 patients enrolled in the study, 501 (90%) were biologic naive. Patients were allocated to one of three treatment groups: Cosentyx 150 mg subcutaneously with loading dose (Induction: 150 mg Secukinumab subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks, then maintenance with 150 mg Secukinumab monthly); Cosentyx 150 mg no loading dose (150 mg Secukinumab subcutaneously monthly), or placebo (induction of subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks, followed by maintenance of once-monthly)10.

The primary endpoints are the proportion of biologic-naïve patients achieving an ASAS40 response with Cosentyx 150 mg at weeks 16 and 52. Secondary endpoints include change in BASDAI over time and change in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score with CRP (ASDAS-CRP)10.

ASAS40 is achieved when there is a measure of an improvement of at least 40% and an improvement of at least 20 units on a 0–100 scale in at least three of the following domains: Patient global assessment, Pain assessment, Function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)), and Inflammation (morning stiffness severity and duration) and no worsening in the remaining domains21. BASDAI assesses a patient’s disease activity on six measures: fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain/swelling, enthesitis, morning stiffness duration and morning stiffness severity21.

35031,Sanofi Report Results of Avalglucosidase alfa in P-III COMET Study for Late Onset Pompe Disease,Sanofi’s investigational enzyme replacement therapy shows clinically meaningful improvement in critical manifestations of late-onset Pompe disease,"The P-III COMET study involves assessing avalglucosidase alfa (20 mg/kg) vs alglucosidase alfa (SOC, 20 mg/kg) IV infusion q2w for 49 wks. After 49 wks., patients previously receiving SOC switched to avalglucosidase alfa for the ongoing open-label treatment portion of the study
 Results: met its 1EPs i.e. demonstrating non-inferiority in improving respiratory function, FVC (% predicted) (2.89 vs 0.46); 2EPs is measured mobility with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) (32.21 vs 2.19 mts.); pre-specified preliminary analysis evaluating percent-predicted FVC and 6MWT in those patients who switched (switch patients)@49 wks. for the OLE period of the trial showed 0.15-point improvement in FVC and 23.32-meter improvement in 6MWT
 Avalglucosidase alfa is an investigational ERT for Pompe disease designed to improve the delivery of enzyme to the cells in the muscles and is evaluated in ongoing P-II NEO-EXT study in patients with LOPD for a duration of up to ~ 8 yrs. in patients from the P-I /II NEO1 study. The regulatory submissions to be anticipated in H2’20","Avalglucosidase alfa showed a 2.4-point improvement in percent-predicted forced vital capacity, an important measure of respiratory function in Pompe disease, compared to alglucosidase alfa (standard of care)
Patients treated with avalglucosidase alfa walked 30 meters farther than those treated with standard of care, as measured by the 6-minute walk test
Global regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2020
PARIS – June 16, 2020 – Sanofi’s investigational enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), avalglucosidase alfa, showed clinically meaningful improvement in critical manifestations (respiratory impairment and decreased mobility) of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) according to results from the Phase 3 trial presented today at a Sanofi-hosted scientific session. Avalglucosidase alfa met the primary endpoint demonstrating non-inferiority in improving respiratory function compared to alglucosidase alfa (standard of care) in patients with LOPD. These data will form the basis for global regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of this year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations to avalglucosidase alfa for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease.

The trial primary endpoint evaluated the change in respiratory muscle function using percent-predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) in the upright position. Patients treated with avalglucosidase alfa had a 2.4-point greater improvement in percent-predicted FVC compared to patients treated with standard of care (95% CI, -0.13 / 4.99), a numerical improvement in respiratory function that surpassed the study-designed measure of non-inferiority (p=0.0074).

The primary endpoint was also measured for superiority. Superiority statistical significance was not achieved for the avalglucosidase alfa arm (p=0.0626). As a result, per the hierarchy of the study protocol, formal statistical testing for all secondary endpoints was not conducted.

A key secondary endpoint in the trial measured mobility with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Patients treated with avalglucosidase alfa walked 30 meters farther (95% CI, 1.33 / 58.69) than patients treated with standard of care. Other secondary endpoints assessed respiratory muscle strength, motor function, and quality of life.

“Pompe disease can be debilitating as it progressively deteriorates the muscles. It’s important that potential new treatment options offer patients clinically meaningful improvement across multiple measures of respiratory and motor function,” said Jordi Diaz-Manera, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Neuromuscular Disorders, Translational Medicine and Genetics at the John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Center, Newcastle University, UK. “The findings from the Phase 3 trial are very encouraging and add to the growing body of clinical evidence demonstrating the potential of avalglucosidase alfa to offer a new treatment option in addressing the hallmark symptoms of this disease.”

Also presented were results from a pre-specified preliminary analysis evaluating percent-predicted FVC and 6MWT in those patients who switched (switch patients) at 49 weeks from standard of care to avalglucosidase alfa for the open-label extension period of the trial. Due to sequential enrollment, preliminary analysis results at the time of data presentation were available at 97 weeks for 20 out of 49 switch patients for percent-predicted FVC, and 21 out of 49 switch patients for 6MWT. In these switch patients, avalglucosidase alfa demonstrated a 0.15-point improvement in FVC (95% CI, -1.95 / 2.25) and a 23.32-meter improvement in 6MWT (95% CI, -3.87 / 50.51).

“We’re pleased that avalglucosidase alfa showed clinically meaningful improvement both in respiratory function and mobility, as measured by well-established standard Pompe disease outcome measures,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “These results underscore our ambition to establish avalglucosidase alfa as a new standard of care treatment for Pompe disease.”

The safety profile of avalglucosidase alfa was found to be comparable to standard of care. Over the double-blinded 49-week period, 44 patients in the avalglucosidase alfa arm and 45 patients in the standard of care arm experienced an adverse event(s) (AEs). There were 6 patients with severe AEs in the avalglucosidase alfa arm and 7 patients in the standard of care arm. Fewer patients presented with serious adverse events (SAEs) in the avalglucosidase alfa arm (8 patients, including 1 patient with potentially treatment-related SAEs) compared to the standard of care arm (12 patients, including 3 patients with potentially treatment-related SAEs). In the standard of care arm of the trial, 4 patients had AEs leading to study withdrawal and 1 patient died due to an SAE of acute myocardial infarction (unrelated to treatment). In the avalglucosidase alfa arm, there were no patient discontinuations or deaths. Fewer patients in the avalglucosidase alfa arm (25.5%) experienced at least one protocol-defined infusion-associated reaction compared to the alglucosidase alfa arm (32.7%). Immunogenicity data is being analysed and will be presented at a future medical congress or publication.

Trial design

The randomized, double-blind, Phase 3, head-to-head COMET trial enrolled 100 previously untreated pediatric and adult patients with LOPD across 56 centers in 20 countries. Patients were randomized to receive either avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg or alglucosidase alfa (standard of care) 20 mg/kg intravenous infusion every two weeks for 49 weeks. After 49 weeks, patients previously receiving standard of care switched to avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg for the ongoing open-label treatment portion of the study.i

About Pompe disease

Pompe disease is caused by a genetic deficiency or dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), resulting in build-up of glycogen in muscles, including the proximal muscles and the diaphragm, and eventually causing progressive and irreversible muscle damage. This rare disease affects an estimated 50,000 people worldwide and can manifest at any age from infancy to late adulthood. Pompe disease is often classified as late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) or infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD). Patients with LOPD typically present any time after the first year of life to late adulthood. The hallmark symptoms of LOPD are impaired respiratory function and skeletal muscle weakness, which often leads to impaired mobility. Patients often require wheelchairs to assist with mobility and may require mechanical ventilation to help with breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in patients with Pompe disease. Pompe disease is classified as IOPD when symptoms begin prior to one year of age. In addition to skeletal muscle weakness, heart function is also commonly impacted.

About Avalglucosidase alfa

The goal of ERT for Pompe disease is to deliver enzyme into the lysosomes within muscle cells to replace the missing or deficient GAA that is needed to prevent build-up of glycogen in the muscles. Avalglucosidase alfa is an investigational ERT for Pompe disease designed to improve the delivery of enzyme to the cells in the muscles, most notably into skeletal muscle. With approximately 15-fold increase in mannose-6-phosphate content compared to standard of care alglucosidase alfa, avalglucosidase alfa aims to help improve cellular enzyme uptake and enhance glycogen clearance in target tissues.ii The clinical relevance of this difference has not been confirmed.

Beyond the Phase 3 COMET trial, the avalglucosidase alfa clinical development program includes the ongoing Phase 2 NEO-EXT trialiii investigating the long-term safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and exploratory efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in patients with LOPD for a duration of up to approximately 8 years in participants from the Phase 1 / 2 NEO1 trial. Also, the ongoing Phase 2 mini-COMET trialiv is investigating the safety and efficacy of treatment with avalglucosidase alfa in patients who have infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and were previously treated with alglucosidase alfa. For more information about the avalglucosidase alfa clinical development program, please visit https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Avalglucosidase alfa has not been approved by the U.S. FDA or any other regulatory agency worldwide for the uses under investigation.

 The study demonstrated median PFS (6.3 mos. vs 1.0 mos.), reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 85%, mORR of 9.4%, mOS (15.1 mos. vs 6.6 mos.), reduced the risk of death by 64%
 Qinlock (ripretinib) is kinase inhibitor targeted to treat adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)","WALTHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–May 15, 2020– Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:DCPH) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved QINLOCK™ (ripretinib) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who have received prior treatment with 3 or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. The FDA previously granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations as well as Priority Review for QINLOCK and reviewed the New Drug Application (NDA) under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program. The QINLOCK NDA is also part of Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among participating international health authorities. QINLOCK targets the broad spectrum of KIT and PDGFRα mutations known to drive GIST.

“Today’s approval of QINLOCK establishes a new standard of care for patients who have received three prior therapies,” said Margaret von Mehren, MD, Chief of Sarcoma Oncology and Associate Director for Clinical Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “GIST is a complex disease and the majority of patients who initially respond to traditional tyrosine kinase inhibitors eventually develop tumor progression due to secondary mutations. In the INVICTUS study, QINLOCK has demonstrated compelling clinical benefit in progression-free and overall survival. QINLOCK is well tolerated and is a crucial new therapy for these patients with a high unmet need.”

“The FDA approval of QINLOCK is an exciting milestone for people with GIST who have been waiting for a new treatment option designed specifically for their disease,” said Steve Hoerter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Deciphera. “I would like to thank the patients, their families and caregivers, and the healthcare professionals who made the QINLOCK clinical studies possible. With their contributions and the dedication of the team at Deciphera, we are delivering on our promise to provide important new medicines for the treatment of cancer.”

The FDA approval was based on efficacy results from the pivotal Phase 3 INVICTUS study of QINLOCK in patients with advanced GIST as well as combined safety results from INVICTUS and the Phase 1 study of QINLOCK. In INVICTUS, QINLOCK demonstrated a median progression-free survival of 6.3 months compared to 1.0 month in the placebo arm and significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 85% (hazard ratio of 0.15, p<0.0001). In addition, QINLOCK demonstrated a median overall survival of 15.1 months compared to 6.6 months in the placebo arm and reduced the risk of death by 64% (hazard ratio of 0.36).

The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were alopecia, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, myalgia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES), and vomiting. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation occurred in 8% of patients, dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 24% of patients and dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 7% of patients who received QINLOCK.

Deciphera Pharmaceuticals plans to make QINLOCK commercially available in the U.S. next week.

Deciphera is committed to supporting GIST patients and removing barriers to access. As part of that commitment, Deciphera has established Deciphera AccessPoint, a patient support program that provides reimbursement and financial assistance programs for eligible patients.

About the INVICTUS Phase 3 Study

INVICTUS is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicenter clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of QINLOCK compared to placebo in patients with advanced GIST whose previous therapies have included imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. Patients were randomized 2:1 to either 150 mg of QINLOCK or placebo once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by independent radiologic review using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The median PFS in the study was 6.3 months compared to 1.0 month in the placebo arm and significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 85% (hazard ratio of 0.15, p<0.0001). Secondary endpoints as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST include Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Overall Survival (OS). QINLOCK demonstrated an ORR of 9.4% compared with 0% for placebo (p =0.0504). QINLOCK also demonstrated a median OS of 15.1 months compared to 6.6 months in the placebo arm and reduced the risk of death by 64% (hazard ratio of 0.36).

About QINLOCK (ripretinib)

Indications and Usage

QINLOCK (ripretinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who have received prior treatment with 3 or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. For more information visit QINLOCK.com.

Important Safety Information

There are no contraindications for QINLOCK.

Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES): In INVICTUS, Grade 1-2 PPES occurred in 21% of the 85 patients who received QINLOCK. PPES led to dose discontinuation in 1.2% of patients, dose interruption in 2.4% of patients, and dose reduction in 1.2% of patients. Based on severity, withhold QINLOCK and then resume at same or reduced dose.

New Primary Cutaneous Malignancies: In INVICTUS, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) occurred in 4.7% of the 85 patients who received QINLOCK with a median time to event of 4.6 months (range 3.8 to 6 months). In the pooled safety population, cuSCC and keratoacanthoma occurred in 7% and 1.9% of 351 patients, respectively. In INVICTUS, melanoma occurred in 2.4% of the 85 patients who received QINLOCK. In the pooled safety population, melanoma occurred in 0.9% of 351 patients. Perform dermatologic evaluations when initiating QINLOCK and routinely during treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Continue QINLOCK at the same dose.

Hypertension: In INVICTUS, Grade 1-3 hypertension occurred in 14% of the 85 patients who received QINLOCK, including Grade 3 hypertension in 7% of patients. Do not initiate QINLOCK in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Monitor blood pressure as clinically indicated. Based on severity, withhold QINLOCK and then resume at same or reduced dose or permanently discontinue.

Cardiac Dysfunction: In INVICTUS, cardiac failure occurred in 1.2% of the 85 patients who received QINLOCK. In the pooled safety population, cardiac dysfunction (including cardiac failure, acute left ventricular failure, diastolic dysfunction, and ventricular hypertrophy) occurred in 1.7% of 351 patients, including Grade 3 adverse reactions in 1.1% of patients.

In INVICTUS, Grade 3 decreased ejection fraction occurred in 2.6% of the 77 patients who received QINLOCK and who had a baseline and at least one post-baseline echocardiogram. Grade 3 decreased ejection fraction occurred in 3.4% of the 263 patients in the pooled safety population who received QINLOCK and who had a baseline and at least one post-baseline echocardiogram.

In INVICTUS, cardiac dysfunction led to dose discontinuation in 1.2% of the 85 patients who received QINLOCK. The safety of QINLOCK has not been assessed in patients with a baseline ejection fraction below 50%. Assess ejection fraction by echocardiogram or MUGA scan prior to initiating QINLOCK and during treatment, as clinically indicated. Permanently discontinue QINLOCK for Grade 3 or 4 left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: QINLOCK has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold QINLOCK for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of QINLOCK after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: QINLOCK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1week after the final dose. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 1 week after the final dose. QINLOCK may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential.

Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were alopecia, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, myalgia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, PPES, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥4%) were increased lipase and decreased phosphate.

The safety and effectiveness of QINLOCK in pediatric patients have not been established.

Administer strong CYP3A inhibitors with caution. Monitor patients who are administered strong CYP3A inhibitors more frequently for adverse reactions. Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers.

About GIST

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a cancer affecting the digestive tract or nearby structures within the abdomen, most often presenting in the stomach or small intestine. GIST is the most common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract, with approximately 4,000 to 6,000 new GIST cases each year in the United States and a similar incidence rate in European and other countries. Most cases of GIST are driven by a spectrum of mutations. The most common primary mutations are in KIT kinase, representing approximately 80% of cases, or in PDGFRα kinase, representing approximately 6% of cases. Current therapies are unable to inhibit the full spectrum of primary and secondary mutations, which drives resistance and disease progression. Estimates for 5-year survival range from 48% to 90%, depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis.

About Deciphera Pharmaceuticals

Deciphera, a commercial biopharmaceutical company, is decoding cancer at the molecular level and leveraging its proprietary kinase switch control technology to develop therapies for hard-to-treat cancers. The Company has one FDA-approved product, QINLOCK, a broad-spectrum KIT and PDGFRα inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with fourth-line GIST and is using its platform to develop a diverse pipeline of drug candidates designed to improve outcomes for patients with cancer.

 Artesunate’s (IV) safety and efficacy was examined vs standard of care drug in three trials including the South East Asian Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial (SEAQUAMAT) and the African Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial (AQUAMAT) enrolling 6,886 patients and reported reduced mortality (34.7% vs 22.5%)
 The CDC will continue the process of manufacturing investigational IV artesunate available under the CDC-sponsored expanded access IND 76,725, in effect per FDA’s authorization since 2007 until nationwide availability of Amivas-produced Artesunate for Injection is in place in the next few months","FREDERICK, Md., May 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ —

Artesunate for Injection 110 mg, powder and solvent for solution is approved by FDA for initial treatment of severe malaria in adult and pediatric patients.
Artesunate for Injection is in a group of drugs known as “artemisinin derivatives” and is on the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines.
Since 2007, Investigational Intravenous (IV) Artesunate has been available in the US only through an expanded access investigational new drug (IND) program managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). FDA approval allows Amivas (US), LLC to manufacture, distribute and commercialize Artesunate for Injection.
Amivas was formed in 2016 expressly for the purpose of making this life-saving drug readily available in the US.
Approximately 2,000 US cases of malaria are diagnosed annually. Without appropriate treatment, about 15 percent become severe. Mortality from untreated severe malaria (particularly cerebral malaria) approaches 100 percent.
Amivas (US), LLC, specialists in treatments for rare and neglected tropical diseases, including severe malaria, announced today that Artesunate for Injection 110 mg, powder and solvent for solution has received marketing approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Artesunate for Injection is indicated for the initial treatment of severe malaria in adult and pediatric patients. It is the first FDA-approved product that Amivas, headquartered in Frederick, Maryland, has introduced to their commercial portfolio.

Amivas will now manufacture, distribute, and commercialize Artesunate for Injection and is completing set-up of a nationwide product distribution network. Prior to FDA approval, access to investigational IV Artesunate had been managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since 2007 via an expanded access investigational new drug (IND) program. Additional information regarding commercial availability of Artesunate for Injection as produced by Amivas will be posted to https://ivartesunate.com. The CDC will continue to make investigational IV artesunate available under the CDC-sponsored expanded access IND 76,725, in effect per FDA’s authorization since 2007 until nationwide availability of Amivas-produced Artesunate for Injection is in place in the next few months.

“We are extremely pleased to have secured this important regulatory milestone for Artesunate for Injection,” said Bryan Smith, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Amivas. “As most medical professionals know, when a patient with severe malaria arrives in the clinic, emergency room or elsewhere, immediate treatment with a safe, efficacious, fast-acting, injectable therapy is absolutely critical to saving that life. Given today’s FDA approval of Artesunate for Injection and the deep expertise that Amivas can bring to the challenges of treating rare tropical diseases, we look forward to making significant ongoing contributions to saving the lives of patients with severe malaria.”

Until Amivas’ Artesunate for Injection is available in hospitals, healthcare professionals seeking IV artesunate for treatment of patients with severe malaria should contact the CDC for obtaining investigational IV artesunate (www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment/artesunate.html (770-488-7788) Monday–Friday, 9 am–5 pm EST. Outside these hours, providers should call 770-488-7100). This transition will progress rapidly in coming months. Updates will appear on CDC and Amivas webpages.

Development of Artesunate for Injection in the US has been under US Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC). Within USAMRDC, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the US Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) joint collaborative work has provided the CDC a constant supply of IV artesunate since 2007. USAMMDA established a cooperative research and development agreement with Amivas to modernize Artesunate manufacture and register the product with the FDA.

“FDA approval of Artesunate for Injection is another notable achievement for the US Army in its long history of developing therapies for combating malaria. With a lack of alternate FDA approved therapies to treat life-threatening severe malaria, Artesunate for Injection fills a critical gap for the military and US population. This difficult undertaking was accomplished through a competitively bid, public/private partnership and is testament to the professionalism and dedication of the team involved,” said Major Victor Zottig, PhD, Artesunate Product Manager for USAMMDA.

Bryan Smith, MD, himself a US Army Veteran, further commented, “Proceeds from the sale of any Priority Review Voucher (PRV) that may be awarded to Amivas have been earmarked to support a US Army nominated Veteran charity, to augment global supply of IV Artesunate and to continue post-marketing studies agreed with FDA.”

Clinical Studies
The safety and efficacy of IV Artesunate was studied in three trials including the South East Asian Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial (SEAQUAMAT)[i] and the African Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial (AQUAMAT). These two studies examined a total of 6,886 patients and included adults, children and pregnant women. IV Artesunate reduced mortality by 34.7 percent and 22.5 percent compared with the injectable standard of care drug in the SEAQUMAT and AQUAMAT studies respectively. Data were also collected between January 2007 and December 2010 on 102 US patients with severe or complicated malaria who were supplied IV Artesunate under the CDC expanded access protocol. Ninety two patients received at least one administration of drug at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours. These US patients included adults, children, pregnant women and older adults. Most were Black or African American, 25 percent were White, 9 percent were Asian. Seven patients died from complications of severe malaria (mortality rate, 6.9 percent). Primary funding source for the data analysis from patients enrolled in the CDC study was the Office of the Surgeon General, Department of the US Army. While no service personnel were actively recruited into any of the clinical trials of IV Artesunate, several service members were offered emergency treatment under the CDC protocol.

Important Safety Information
Contraindications
Known serious hypersensitivity to artesunate, such as anaphylaxis.

Warnings and Precautions
Post Artesunate Delayed Hemolysis: Post-artesunate delayed hemolysis is characterized by decreased hemoglobin with laboratory evidence of hemolysis (such as decreased haptoglobin and increased lactate dehydrogenase) occurring at least 7 days after initiating artesunate treatment. Cases of post-treatment hemolytic anemia severe enough to require transfusion have been reported. Monitor patients for 4 weeks after artesunate treatment for evidence of hemolytic anemia. Since a subset of patients with delayed hemolysis after artesunate therapy have evidence of immune-mediated hemolysis, consider performing a direct antiglobulin test to determine if therapy, e.g. corticosteroids, is necessary.

Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity to artesunate including cases of anaphylaxis have been reported during the use of parenteral artesunate (including Artesunate for Injection). If hypotension, dyspnea, urticaria, or generalized rash occur during administration of Artesunate for Injection, consider discontinuing Artesunate for Injection administration and continuing therapy with another antimalarial drug.

Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions (2 percent or greater) occurring more frequently in patients receiving intravenous artesunate in the SEAQUAMAT trial were acute renal failure requiring dialysis, hemoglobinuria, and jaundice. The most common adverse reactions in the CDC expanded access protocol were anemia (65 percent), transaminase increase (27 percent), thrombocytopenia (18 percent), hyperbilirubinemia (14 percent), acute renal failure (10 percent), leukocytosis (10 percent), acute respiratory distress syndrome (8 percent), lymphopenia (7 percent), neutropenia (5 percent), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3 percent), elevated creatinine (3 percent), pneumonia (3 percent), pulmonary edema (3 percent), and diarrhea (3 percent).

Drug Interactions
Published clinical reports or in vitro reports indicate that concomitant use of Artesunate for Injection with oral ritonavir, nevirapine, or UGT inducers may decrease dihydroartemisinin (DHA) AUC and Cmax, which may reduce the efficacy of Artesunate for Injection. If Artesunate for Injection is co-administered with ritonavir, nevirapine or strong UGT inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin), monitor for possible reduced antimalarial efficacy of Artesunate for Injection.

Published reports of in vitro data indicate that concomitant use of Artesunate for Injection with UGT inhibitors may increase DHA AUC and Cmax, which may increase DHA associated adverse reactions. Monitor for adverse reactions when co-administering Artesunate for Injection with strong UGT inhibitors (e.g., axitinib, vandetanib, imatinib, diclofenac).

Use in Specific Populations
Pregnancy: There are serious risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe malaria during pregnancy; delaying treatment of severe malaria in pregnancy may result in serious morbidity and mortality to the mother and fetus. Pregnancy outcomes reported from a prospective surveillance study with intravenous artesunate are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, and or fetal death.

Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Artesunate for Injection for the treatment of severe malaria have been established in pediatric patients.

Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Artesunate for Injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects.

About Malaria and Severe Malaria
Malaria is one of the world’s leading killers of people, especially children. Severe malaria, a medical emergency, typically includes neurologic symptoms, severe anemia, acute renal injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or jaundice, as a large number of the patient’s red blood cells become infected by a malaria parasite. Uncomplicated falciparum malaria can progress rapidly to severe forms of the disease, especially in people with no or low immunity, and severe falciparum malaria is almost always fatal without treatment. Prompt, effective treatment within 24-48 hours of the onset of malaria symptoms is necessary.

Malaria is a rare disease in the US. Therefore, it is not always recognized, diagnosed and treated in timely fashion. Nearly all cases in the US occur in persons who acquire the infection while in a malaria endemic area and who are diagnosed after returning to the US. Most are US residents with no acquired immunity to malaria and who are, therefore, at risk of developing severe malaria. A major contributing factor to continued malaria-associated mortality in the US is delay in initiation of appropriate treatment. Malaria chemoprophylaxis and the use of bed nets and insect repellants help reduce the risk of contracting malaria.

About Amivas
Amivas is a US joint venture focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of therapeutic products for the treatment of infectious diseases. Headquartered in Frederick, Maryland, Amivas was formed in 2016 expressly for the purpose of bringing treatments to market for rare and neglected tropical diseases.

 Fensolvi (leuprolide acetate) is a novel six-month, subcutaneous leuprolide acetate an gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist with small injectable suspension pproved for the treatment of pediatric patients two years of age and older with Central Precocious Puberty","BUFFALO GROVE, Ill., May 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Tolmar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its New Drug Application for FENSOLVI® (leuprolide acetate) for injectable suspension for the treatment of pediatric patients two years of age and older with central precocious puberty (CPP). CPP is a rare disease defined as the onset of puberty before age eight in girls and before age nine in boys.

FENSOLVI® (leuprolide acetate) for Injectable Suspension for Pediatric Patients with Central Precocious Puberty 45mg every 6 months; for subcutaneous injection
Leuprolide acetate is the most widely used treatment for CPP. Fensolvi utilizes an innovative proprietary polymeric gel technology that forms an in-situ solid after injection and releases leuprolide acetate in a sustained and controlled manner over time. This polymeric gel technology enables a small volume of injection of only 0.375mL, subcutaneous administration, and a six-month dosing cycle.

“We are very enthusiastic about our clinical data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of Fensolvi. The six-months dosing schedule, small volume of injection, and subcutaneous administration are important new product features,” said Dr. Stuart Atkinson, MB ChB, Vice President and Head of Medical Affairs, Tolmar Pharmaceuticals.

Fensolvi Efficacy and Safety

FDA approval was based on results from a multicenter, open-label, single arm Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of leuprolide acetate (LA) 45 mg for injectable suspension in 64 children with central (gonadotropin-dependent) precocious puberty. The study achieved its primary endpoint, with 87 percent of children achieving a serum luteinizing hormone concentration of <4 IU/L at six months post injection. The study also demonstrated that Fensolvi suppressed sex hormones to pre-pubertal levels, and stopped or reversed the progression of clinical signs of puberty.

“Children with CPP require treatment for several years and missing treatment or stopping treatment too soon may lead to significant short stature and misalignment between chronological age and physical and emotional development,” said Karen Klein, M.D., Associate Clinical Professor, Rady Children’s Hospital, University of California San Diego. “Fensolvi offers treating physicians and their patients with CPP a safe and effective treatment option that is administered twice a year with a small injection volume that has the potential to improve compliance.”

Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly mild or moderate, with none leading to withdrawal from the study. The most common TEAEs were injection site pain (31%), nasopharyngitis (22%), and fever (17%).

About Central Precocious Puberty (CPP)

Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-dependent central precocious puberty (CPP) is the premature development of signs of sexual maturation occurring in girls younger than eight and in boys younger than nine years of age. CPP patients are at risk of having significantly short stature as adults in addition to social, psychological and emotional issues, including lower self-esteem, stress, anxiety and depression, all of which may negatively impact quality of life. CPP is believed to have a five- to twenty-fold higher incidence in girls than in boys and is estimated to occur in one in 5,000-10,000 children.

About Fensolvi® (leuprolide acetate) for injectable suspension

Fensolvi (leuprolide acetate) for injectable suspension is a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients two years of age and older with CPP. It is a prescription drug, given by injection.

Fensolvi is the first and only six-month, subcutaneous leuprolide acetate with a small injection volume that allows flexibility in selection of injection site and enables administration in an office setting. Fensolvi represents an effective, safe and convenient treatment option for this vulnerable patient group, and its profile aligns with twice-yearly visits to the pediatric endocrinologist’s office.

Information about FENSOLVI is available at fensolvi.com.

Important Safety Information for Fensolvi® (leuprolide acetate) for injectable suspension
FENSOLVI (leuprolide acetate) for injectable suspension is a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist used to treat patients 2 years of age and older with central precocious puberty (CPP). CPP may be diagnosed when signs of sexual maturity begin to develop in girls under the age of 8 or in boys under the age of 9.

FENSOLVI is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to any drug that is in the same class as FENSOLVI, in individuals who are allergic to any of the ingredients in FENSOLVI, or in individuals who are pregnant. FENSOLVI may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient.

During the first few weeks of treatment, increases in gonadotropins and sex steroids above baseline may result in an increase in signs and symptoms of puberty including vaginal bleeding in girls.

Psychiatric events have been reported in patients taking GnRH agonists. Events include emotional lability, such as crying, irritability, impatience, anger, and aggression. Patients should be monitored for development or worsening of psychiatric symptoms.

Convulsions have been observed in patients treated with GnRH agonists with or without a history of seizures, epilepsy, cerebrovascular disorders, central nervous system anomalies or tumors, and in patients on concomitant medications that have been associated with convulsions such as bupropion and SSRIs.

The most common adverse events seen with FENSOLVI were: injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, headache, cough, abdominal pain, injection site erythema, nausea, constipation, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchospasm, productive cough and hot flush.

Please see Full Prescribing Information for FENSOLVI for additional important safety information.

35083,Gilead to Initiate P-II/III Study Evaluating Remdesivir in Pediatric Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19,Gilead Sciences Statement on Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Remdesivir in Pediatric Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19,"Gilead will begin enrollment in P-II/III clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy of remdesivir in ~50 pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including newborns through adolescents
 The trial will be conducted at 30+ sites in the US and EU. Remdesivir is available to pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 under our compassionate use program since Feb’2020 as well as under the US FDA’s EUA
 Remdesivir is an investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity both in vitro / in vivo in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, MERS and SARS","Foster City, Calif., June 17, 2020 – Gilead Sciences today issued the following statement from Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences:

“From the onset of the pandemic, Gilead has advanced the development of our investigational antiviral remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19, in parallel with emerging knowledge about the disease. While the novel coronavirus appears to disproportionally affect adults – especially the elderly and those with underlying health conditions – concerning reports have been documented of children and young adults being hospitalized with COVID-19 and related autoimmune symptoms. Gilead has provided remdesivir to pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 under our compassionate use program since February of this year as well as under the U.S. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) granted last month, and we are now taking additional steps to gather data on the drug in this important population.

Coordinating closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Gilead has designed and will soon begin enrollment of an open-label, single-arm Phase 2/3 clinical trial that will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of remdesivir in treating approximately 50 pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including newborns through adolescents. This important trial will be conducted at more than 30 sites in the United States and Europe.

The pediatric study is the latest demonstration of Gilead’s commitment to continued research on remdesivir that may help address emerging patient needs, with the goal of improving outcomes for people with the disease in communities around the world.”

About Remdesivir
Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens. Multiple ongoing international Phase 3 clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The approval status of remdesivir varies by country. In countries where remdesivir has not been approved by the regional health authority, remdesivir is an investigational drug, and the safety and efficacy of remdesivir has not been established. In the U.S., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted remdesivir an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19; severe disease is defined as patients with an oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This authorization is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process. For information about the authorized use of remdesivir and mandatory requirements of the EUA in the U.S., please review the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers and FDA Letter of Authorization available at www.gilead.com/remdesivir.

35094,Roche Reports Results of Tecentriq + CT in P-III IMpassion031 Study for Patients with Early Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Roche’s Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy (including Abraxane) meets primary endpoint of improved pathological complete response, regardless of PD-L1 status, as initial treatment for people with early triple-negative breast cancer","The P-III IMpassion031 study involves assessing of Tecentriq + CT (Abraxane, nab-paclitaxel; followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) vs PBO + CT in 333 people in a ratio (1:1) with previously untreated, early TNBC, regardless of PD-L1 expression
 Results: met its 1EPs by demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in pathological complete response. Patients who received the Tecentriq combination as a neoadjuvant treatment had evidence of tumor tissue detectable at the time of surgery, regardless of PD-L1 expression
 Tecentriq + nab-paclitaxel is currently approved in 70+ countries worldwide, including the US and across EU, for the treatment of adults with unresectable LA/metastatic TNBC in people whose tumors express PD-L1","IMpassion031 data will be discussed with health authorities globally, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency
Tecentriq is the only approved cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, a very aggressive and difficult-to-treat form of breast cancer

Basel, 18 June 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the Phase III IMpassion031 study, evaluating Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy (Abraxane®, albumin-bound paclitaxel; nab-paclitaxel; followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) in comparison to placebo plus chemotherapy (including Abraxane), met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in pathological complete response (pCR) for the treatment of people with early triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), regardless of PD-L1 expression.

“Triple-negative breast cancer remains an aggressive disease with high rates of recurrence,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Our goal in treating TNBC at its earliest stages is to provide people with the best chance for a future cure. Adding Tecentriq to chemotherapy now has the potential to help women with TNBC at multiple different stages of the disease.”

In the study, fewer patients who received the Tecentriq combination as a neoadjuvant (before surgery) treatment had evidence of tumour tissue detectable at the time of surgery (known as pCR), regardless of PD-L1 expression, in comparison to the control arm. Neoadjuvant treatment may allow a doctor to quickly assess whether a medicine is working and may also reduce a tumour’s size so it is easier to surgically remove. pCR is a common measure of neoadjuvant treatment effect and can be assessed more quickly than traditional endpoints in early stage breast cancer.

Safety for the Tecentriq combination appeared to be consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines and no new safety signals were identified. Results of the IMpassion031 study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and will be discussed with global health authorities including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA).

The IMpassion031 study is the second positive Phase III study from Roche demonstrating the benefit of Tecentriq in TNBC, and the first Tecentriq study to demonstrate benefit in early TNBC. Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is currently approved in more than 70 countries worldwide, including the US and across Europe, for the treatment of adults with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC in people whose tumours express PD-L1 (IC≥1%).

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMpassion031 study
The IMpassion031 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel; followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) in comparison to placebo plus chemotherapy, in people with previously untreated, early TNBC. The study enrolled 333 people who were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive Tecentriq or placebo plus chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) setting. Treatment with Tecentriq continued adjuvantly (after surgery) for those in the Tecentriq arm of the study. The primary endpoint is pCR using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and in the PD-L1-positive population. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), event-free survival, disease-free survival and quality of life measures.

About triple-negative breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women with more than 2 million diagnosed worldwide each year.1 TNBC represents ~15% of all breast cancers and is more common in women under the age of 50, compared with other forms of breast cancer.2-4 It is defined by the lack of expression and/or amplification of the targetable receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and HER2 amplification.5 Patients with metastatic TNBC generally experience rapid progression and shorter OS compared to other subtypes of breast cancer.3

About Roche in breast cancer
Roche has been advancing breast cancer research for more than 30 years with the goal of helping as many people with the disease as possible. Our medicines, along with companion diagnostic tests, have contributed to bringing breakthrough innovations in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers. As our understanding of breast cancer biology rapidly improves, we are working to identify new biomarkers and approaches to treatment for all forms of early and advanced breast cancer, including triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive.

Our targeted medicines Herceptin, Perjeta, Kadcyla and Tecentriq are continuing to transform the treatment of early and advanced HER2-postive and triple-negative breast cancers and, through our Tecentriq and ipatasertib clinical programmes, we hope to bring new treatment combinations to people with breast cancer, ultimately improving outcomes.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for people with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

About Roche in cancer immunotherapy
Roche’s rigorous pursuit of groundbreaking science has contributed to major therapeutic and diagnostic advances in oncology over the last 50 years, and today, realising the full potential of cancer immunotherapy is a major area of focus. With over 20 molecules in development, Roche is investigating the potential benefits of immunotherapy alone, and in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapies or other immunotherapies with the goal of providing each person with a treatment tailored to harness their own unique immune system to attack their cancer. Our scientific expertise, coupled with innovative pipeline and extensive partnerships, gives us the confidence to continue pursuing the vision of finding a cure for cancer by ensuring the right treatment for the right patient at the right time.

In addition to Roche’s approved PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), Roche’s broad cancer immunotherapy pipeline includes other checkpoint inhibitors, such as tiragolumab, a novel cancer immunotherapy designed to bind to TIGIT, individualised neoantigen therapies and T-cell bispecific antibodies.

From today, Galaxy Watch Active2 users in South Korea can measure

and track their blood pressure via the Samsung Health Monitor App

anytime, anywhere1

 

Samsung Electronics announced today that the Samsung Health Monitor application has launched in South Korea, following its clearance by South Korea’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) earlier this year. From today, Galaxy Watch Active2 users in Korea can access the Samsung Health Monitor app.2

 

To monitor blood pressure on the Galaxy Watch Active2, users will need to first calibrate with a traditional cuff. They will then be able to tap to “Measure” the blood pressure anytime, anywhere through pulse wave analysis via the Galaxy Watch Active2 wrist sensors.1 The Samsung Health Monitor app analyzes the relationship between the calibration value and the blood pressure change to determine the blood pressure.3

 

When you measure your blood pressure with the Galaxy Watch Active2, the measurement results can be synced to the Samsung Health Monitor app on your Galaxy phone. You can track your blood pressure by days, weeks or months and choose to share this information with your doctor for review or consultation.

 

Electrocardiogram (ECG) tracking will also be supported on the Samsung Health Monitor app in South Korea within the third quarter of this year. Together, the ground-breaking blood pressure and ECG technology will help users monitor and manage their health by providing on-demand measurements.

 

It also means that the Galaxy Watch Active2 now boasts some of Samsung’s most advanced health and wellness capabilities to date, offering users a range of services to help track exercise, sleep, stress and much more.4 It provides users with an easy and convenient way to monitor their wellbeing and receive added health insights.

 

“The launch of the Samsung Health Monitor app demonstrates Samsung’s dedication to providing accessible and convenient healthcare for all by integrating advanced hardware and best-in-class software technology,” said TaeJong Jay Yang, Corporate SVP and Head of Health Team, Mobile Communications Business at Samsung Electronics. “We’re delighted that Galaxy Watch Active2 users in Korea can now access the new app and receive insights to help them manage their health. We look forward to expanding the app to all future Galaxy Watch products.”

 

To measure blood pressure, users must have the Samsung Health Monitor app installed on both the Galaxy Watch Active2 and the Galaxy smartphone. The Samsung Health Monitor app is automatically installed on the Galaxy Watch Active2 by updating the Watch Software to the latest version via the Galaxy Wearable app. The smartwatch app will then open a link, which will direct users to the smartphone app download page in the Galaxy Store app.

 

 

1 To ensure accuracy, users should calibrate their device at least every four weeks.

2 Requires Galaxy smartphone, running Android 7.0 or above and Galaxy Watch Active2 or upcoming Galaxy Watch device(s) to be paired.

3 Users should measure their blood pressure when at rest, as they would do with a traditional cuff, and refrain from measuring when they are working out, smoking or drinking.

The establishment of our GCC hub marks the first launch in the Middle East to complement our existing network of eight other hubs across Emerging Markets, boosting the capabilities to provide world-leading services to their patients. We are very excited about this collaboration that will support diabetes patients and facilitate the disease management.”

 

GCC countries have some of the highest prevalence of diabetes in the world, linked to the similarly high levels of obesityi, and the number of people in GCC countries with type-2 diabetes is projected to increase by 96.3% by 2035ii.

 

Studies have shown that diabetes control is poor amongst adults with type-2 diabetes in the GCC. As a result, the region has a disproportionate number of diabetes complications, for example GCC countries are responsible for 40%-70% of the world’s diabetes-related foot amputationsii. Increased awareness and education about the best ways to manage diabetes and reduce the risk of developing serious complications have been identified as key to addressing the impact of diabetes in the regioni.

 

Gendius’ Intellin® platform uses artificial intelligence to actively monitor patients’ diabetes management and uses their clinical history to highlight their risk for developing diabetes-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, amputation, and blindness. Its algorithms analyse users’ health and wellbeing data to provide individually tailored, clinically-validated educational content and guidance to help people with diabetes to manage their condition more effectively.

 

Intellin® is compatible with more than 150 apps and connected health devices, ranging from Fitbit and Garmin devices, to more specialist blood glucose monitors and blood pressure cuffs. Once connected, Intellin® can automatically collect and analyse users’ health data without requiring manual input.

35122,Genmab and Janssen's Darzalex Faspro (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj) Receive the US FDA's Approval to Treat Multiple Myeloma in Adults,"Genmab Announces U.S. FDA Approval of Subcutaneous Formulation of Daratumumab, DARZALEX FASPRO™ (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), for the Treatment of Patients with Multiple Myeloma","The approval is based on two studies: COLUMBA (MMY3012, P-III) study and P-II PLEIADES (MMY2040) study, which involves assessing of subcutaneous daratumumab (1800 mg) with rHuPH20 2,000 U/mL, combination with either bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-VRd) or bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP)
 In Feb 2019, results from COLUMBA study were announced, presented in oral sessions at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting and the 24th European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress. Additionally, in Dec 2019, an update of the COLUMBA data as well as data from the PLEIADES study were presented during poster sessions at the 61st ASH Annual Meeting
 DARZALEX FASPRO is a fixed dose formulation administered every three to five minutes to patients with multiple myeloma in the US","Copenhagen, Denmark; May 01, 2020 – Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has approved the use of the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab, DARZALEX FASPRO™ (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj). The Biologics License Application (BLA) for this formulation was submitted by Genmab’s licensing partner, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen) in July 2019. DARZALEX FASPRO is approved for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma: in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT); in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for ASCT and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy; and as monotherapy, in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent. DARZALEX FASPRO is a fixed-dose formulation that can be administered over approximately three to five minutes, significantly less time than intravenous DARZALEX®, which is given over several hours. In August 2012, Genmab granted Janssen an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab.

The approval was based on data from two studies: the Phase III non-inferiority COLUMBA (MMY3012) study, which compared the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab to the intravenous formulation in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and data from the Phase II PLEIADES (MMY2040) study, which is evaluating subcutaneous daratumumab in combination with different standard multiple myeloma treatment regimens. The topline results from the COLUMBA study were announced in February 2019 and subsequently presented in oral sessions at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and the 24th European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress. An update of the COLUMBA data as well as data from the PLEIADES study were presented during poster sessions at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2019.

“The approval of the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab, DARZALEX FASPRO, is a landmark event in the development of daratumumab. Not only is it now the first and only subcutaneous CD38 antibody approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, the subcutaneous administration of DARZALEX FASPRO considerably reduces treatment burden, as the fixed-dose injection is administered in approximately three to five minutes, offering patients a more convenient treatment experience. As seen in the pivotal study supporting the approval, this reduction in infusion time from hours to minutes led to higher satisfaction levels for patients and in addition, infusion-related reactions were both mild and significantly reduced with this formulation of daratumumab. We are very much looking forward to the launch of DARZALEX FASPRO in the U.S. and the potential for positive impact it will have on the lives of the patients receiving the drug,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab.

About the COLUMBA (MMY3012) study
The Phase III trial (NCT03277105) is a randomized, open-label, parallel assignment study that included 522 adults diagnosed with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Patients were randomized to receive either: subcutaneous (SC) daratumumab, as 1,800 mg daratumumab with rHuPH20 2,000 U/mL once weekly in Cycle 1 and 2, every two weeks in Cycles 3 to 6, every 4 weeks in Cycle 7 and thereafter until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or the end of study; or 16 mg/kg IV daratumumab once weekly in Cycle 1 and 2, every two weeks in Cycles 3 to 6, every 4 weeks in Cycle 7 and thereafter until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or the end of study. The co-primary endpoints of the study are overall response rate and Maximum trough concentration of daratumumab (Ctrough; defined as the serum pre-dose concentration of daratumumab on Cycle 3 Day 1).

About the PLEIADES (MMY2040) study
The Phase II trial (NCT03412565) is a non-randomized, open-label, parallel assignment study that includes 265 adults either newly diagnosed or with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma are being treated with 1,800 mg SC daratumumab in combination with either bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-VRd) or bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP). Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma are being treated with 1,800 mg SC daratumumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd). An additional cohort of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma treated with daratumumab plus carfilzomib and dexamethasone (D-Kd) was subsequently added to the study. The primary endpoint for the D-VMP, D-Kd and D-Rd cohorts is overall response rate. The primary endpoint for the D-VRd cohort is very good partial response or better rate.

DARZALEX FASPRO™ (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab, is approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma: in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for ASCT; in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for ASCT and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy; and as monotherapy, in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a PI and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent. DARZALEX FASPRO is the first subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved in the U.S. for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

Daratumumab is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to the CD38 molecule, which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. Daratumumab triggers a person’s own immune system to attack the cancer cells, resul cvfting in rapid tumor cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action and through immunomodulatory effects, in addition to direct tumor cell death, via apoptosis (programmed cell death).1,2,3,4,5,6

Daratumumab is being developed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. under an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab from Genmab. A comprehensive clinical development program for daratumumab is ongoing, including multiple Phase III studies in smoldering, relapsed and refractory and frontline multiple myeloma settings. Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess the potential of daratumumab in other malignant and pre-malignant diseases in which CD38 is expressed, such as amyloidosis and T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Daratumumab has received two Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA for certain indications of multiple myeloma, including as a monotherapy for heavily pretreated multiple myeloma and in combination with certain other therapies for second-line treatment of multiple myeloma.

35125,Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) Receives the US FDA's Approval as Monotherapy for Patients with Unresectable or Metastatic Tumor Mutational Burden-High Solid Tumors,"FDA Approves Second Biomarker-Based Indication for Merck’s KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), Regardless of Tumor Type","The accelerated approval is based on KEYNOTE-158 study assessing Keytruda (200mg, q3w). In a study, 1,050 patients were included in the efficacy analysis population in which TMB was analyzed in the subset of 790 patients with sufficient tissue for testing based on protocol-specified testing requirements, out of 790, 102 had tumors identified as TMB-H, defined as TMB ≥10 mut/Mb
 Results: In patients whose tumors were TMB-H, ORR (29%); CR (4%); PR (25%); after a median follow-up time of 11.1 mos. mDOR (not reached). In a pre-specified analysis of patients with TMB ≥13 mut/Mb: ORR (37%); CR (3%); PR (34%), In an exploratory analysis in 32 patients whose cancer had TMB ≥10 mut/Mb & <13 mut/Mb, the ORR (13%); median duration of exposure (4.9mos.)
 The FDA also approved FoundationOne CDx test as the companion diagnostic to identify patients with solid tumors that are TMB-H (≥10 mutations/ megabase) who may benefit from immunotherapy treatment with Keytruda monotherapy","KEYTRUDA Is Now Approved for Adult and Pediatric Patients with Unresectable or Metastatic Tumor Mutational Burden-High (TMB-H) [≥10 Mutations/Megabase] Solid Tumors, as Determined by an FDA-Approved Test, That Have Progressed Following Prior Treatment and Who Have No Satisfactory Alternative Treatment Options

KEYTRUDA Is the First Checkpoint Inhibitor Approved for These Patients with TMB-H Solid Tumors

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) [≥10 mutations/megabase (mut/Mb)] solid tumors, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with TMB-H central nervous system cancers have not been established.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.

“For the second time, KEYTRUDA monotherapy is now approved based on a biomarker rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “TMB-H, defined as 10 mutations per megabase or more, can help identify patients most likely to benefit from KEYTRUDA. We’re pleased that our collaborative efforts to advance biomarker research have resulted in our ability to provide a new treatment option that addresses a high unmet medical need for these patients with cancer.”

“As physicians, we are always looking to find new options for patients, especially in the second-line or higher treatment setting,” said Roy S. Herbst, M.D., Ph.D., ensign professor of medicine (medical oncology) and professor of pharmacology, Yale School of Medicine; chief of medical oncology, Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital; and associate cancer center director for translational research, Yale Cancer Center. “It’s great to see the use of innovative biomarkers and immunotherapy come together with this approval and encouraging that we now have an option for patients with TMB-H tumors across cancer types, including rare cancers.”

The FDA also approved FoundationOne® CDx test as the companion diagnostic to identify patients with solid tumors that are TMB-H (≥10 mutations/ megabase) who may benefit from immunotherapy treatment with KEYTRUDA monotherapy.

“These approvals stem from years of research into how TMB levels may influence a patient’s response to immunotherapy,” said Brian Alexander, M.D., M.P.H., chief medical officer, Foundation Medicine. “It’s critical that healthcare professionals have access to a validated genomic test to measure TMB in clinical tumor assessments and pinpoint those who are more likely to respond. We’re proud to be collaborating with Merck to help match appropriate patients to this important treatment.”

Data Supporting the Approval

The accelerated approval was based on data from a prospectively-planned retrospective analysis of 10 cohorts (A through J) of patients with various previously treated unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with TMB-H, who were enrolled in KEYNOTE-158 (NCT02628067), a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label trial evaluating KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks). The trial excluded patients who previously received an anti-PD-1 or other immune-modulating monoclonal antibody, or who had an autoimmune disease, or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. TMB status was assessed using the FoundationOne CDx assay and pre-specified cutpoints of ≥10 and ≥13 mut/Mb, and testing was blinded with respect to clinical outcomes. Tumor response was assessed every nine weeks for the first 12 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) in the patients who received at least one dose of KEYTRUDA as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ.

In KEYNOTE-158, 1,050 patients were included in the efficacy analysis population. TMB was analyzed in the subset of 790 patients with sufficient tissue for testing based on protocol-specified testing requirements. Of the 790 patients, 102 (13%) had tumors identified as TMB-H, defined as TMB ≥10 mut/Mb. The study population characteristics of these 102 patients were: median age of 61 years (range, 27 to 80); 34% age 65 or older; 34% male; 81% White; and 41% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 and 58% ECOG PS of 1. Fifty-six percent of patients had at least two prior lines of therapy.

In the 102 patients whose tumors were TMB-H, KEYTRUDA demonstrated an ORR of 29% (95% CI, 21-39), with a complete response rate of 4% and a partial response rate of 25%. After a median follow-up time of 11.1 months, the median DOR had not been reached (range, 2.2+ to 34.8+ months). Among the 30 responding patients, 57% had ongoing responses of 12 months or longer, and 50% had ongoing responses of 24 months or longer.

In a pre-specified analysis of patients with TMB ≥13 mut/Mb (n=70), KEYTRUDA demonstrated an ORR of 37% (95% CI, 26-50), with a complete response rate of 3% and a partial response rate of 34%. After a median follow-up time of 11.1 months, the median DOR had not been reached (range, 2.2+ to 34.8+ months). Among the 26 responding patients, 58% had ongoing responses of 12 months or longer, and 50% had ongoing responses of 24 months or longer. In an exploratory analysis in 32 patients whose cancer had TMB ≥10 mut/Mb and <13 mut/Mb, the ORR was 13% (95% CI, 4-29), including two complete responses and two partial responses.

The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 4.9 months (range, 0.03 to 35.2 months). The most common adverse reactions for KEYTRUDA (reported in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, constipation, pain and abdominal pain.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions

Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Erez Israeli, CEO of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, commented, “We are excited about the approval of ELYXYB. It reaffirms our commitment to innovation and to develop meaningfully differentiated products that address significant unmet needs of patients and physicians, leading to better health outcomes.”

According to Anil Namboodiripad, PhD, Sr. Vice President of the Proprietary Products Group, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, “ELYXYB is an oral solution of celecoxib formulated using a self-micro emulsifying drug delivery system that improves solubility and bioavailability of the drug leading to better absorption1. This allows for administration of a lower dose without affecting bioavailability. In pivotal studies, ELYXYB demonstrated a rapid onset of action which is critically important to patients suffering from acute migraine attacks. The results from pivotal studies with ELYXYB established efficacy of celecoxib in the treatment of migraine with very few adverse events. For patients who suffer from the debilitating and disruptive effects of migraine, there continues to be a need for reliable and efficacious treatment options. ELYXYB’s oral solution dosage form makes it convenient for patients to take it immediately upon emergence of migraine attacks.”

INDICATION AND USAGE

ELYXYB is indicated in adults for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura.

Limitations of Use:

ELYXYB is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION:

WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL EVENTS

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in the treatment and may increase with duration of use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
ELYXYB is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
ELYXB is contraindicated in patients with:

Known hypersensitivity to celecoxib, any components of the drug product, or sulfonamides (4)
History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (4)
In the setting of CABG surgery (4)
To minimize the potential risk for an adverse cardiovascular (CV) event in NSAID-treated patients, use ELYXYB for the fewest number of days per month as needed, based on individual treatment goals. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

Avoid the use of ELYXYB in patients with a recent myocardial infarction (MI) unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If ELYXYB is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

NSAIDs, including ELYXYB, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with celecoxib. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Avoid the use of ELYXYB in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If ELYXYB is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs, including ELYXYB.

Long-term administration of NSAIDs, including celecoxib, the active ingredient in ELYXYB, has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with severe renal impairment. The renal effects of celecoxib may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month), including ELYXYB, may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.

NSAIDs, including ELYXYB, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk.

Most common adverse reaction (at least 3% and greater than placebo) is dysgeusia.

These are not all the side effects associated with ELYXYB.

Please see Patient Information, Instructions For Use, Medication Guide and Full Prescribing Information for ELYXYB (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/212157s000lbl.pdf).

 Kynmobi sublingual film used to treat short-term (acute), intermittent “off” episodes in people with Parkinson’s disease with expected availability in Sep 2020","MARLBOROUGH, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Sunovion) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KYNMOBI™ (apomorphine HCI) sublingual film (APL-130277) for the acute, intermittent treatment of OFF episodes in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). OFF episodes are the re-emergence or worsening of PD symptoms otherwise controlled with oral levodopa/carbidopa. They may be characterized, in part, by tremor, stiffness, slowed movement or other symptoms. These disruptive episodes can occur in the morning upon waking and throughout the day. KYNMOBI dissolves under the tongue to help people with PD improve their OFF symptoms as needed.

“Today’s approval of KYNMOBI advances treatment options for people with Parkinson’s disease who experience OFF episodes and the associated disruption of everyday activities,” said Antony Loebel, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer at Sunovion. “We are pleased to offer the Parkinson’s disease community a novel treatment option that we believe offers a convenient way for patients to rapidly improve impaired movements and better control their motor symptoms when they need it.”

Parkinson’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease in which dopamine producing cells are lost. It is projected that 1.2 million Americans will be living with PD by 2030.1 Within the first four to six years after diagnosis, regardless of disease severity, up to 60 percent of people with PD experience OFF episodes.2

“Several years after a person is diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease they may notice problems such as having trouble getting out of bed in the morning or having difficulty getting out of a chair, or that they feel frozen while trying to walk as the effect of their maintenance medication diminishes,” said Stewart Factor, D.O., Professor of Neurology, Director of the Movement Disorders Program and Vance Lanier Chair of Neurology at Emory University School of Medicine. “The approval of KYNMOBI affords health care providers with a needed option that can be added to their patients’ medication regimen to adequately address OFF episodes as their Parkinson’s disease progresses.”

“We know from our research and discussions with the Parkinson’s community that OFF episodes can significantly disrupt a patient’s daily life,” said Todd Sherer, Ph.D., CEO, The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. “The Foundation supported early clinical development of sublingual apomorphine, and this approval brings an important new treatment option for people with PD who experience OFF.”

Sunovion expects KYNMOBI to be available in U.S. pharmacies in September 2020.

Medical information, patient assistance and other information about KYNMOBI can be obtained by calling Sunovion Answers at 1-844-596-6624 (844-KYNMOBI) Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET.

ABOUT KYNMOBI™

KYNMOBI (apomorphine hydrochloride) sublingual film, a novel formulation of apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, is the first and only sublingual therapy for the fast-acting, on-demand treatment of OFF episodes associated with Parkinson’s disease. KYNMOBI may be used up to five times a day.

Phase 3 clinical trial results, published in Lancet Neurology,demonstrated that patients with PD receiving KYNMOBI experienced significant improvements in motor symptoms at 30 minutes after dosing at week 12, with a mean reduction of 7.6 points, compared to placebo, on the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III score. Initial clinical improvements were seen at 15 minutes post-administration. Additionally, a significantly higher percentage of people treated with KYNMOBI had a patient-rated full ON response within 30 minutes at week 12, compared with people receiving placebo. KYNMOBI was generally well-tolerated. Among the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events in this study (occurring in more than 5 percent of patients and at a rate greater than placebo) were nausea, oropharyngeal reactions, somnolence and dizziness.

Important Safety Information

INDICATION

KYNMOBITM (apomorphine hydrochloride) sublingual film is a prescription medicine used to treat short-term (acute), intermittent “off” episodes in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD).

It is not known if KYNMOBI is safe and effective in children.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR KYNMOBI (apomorphine hydrochloride) SUBLINGUAL FILM

Do not take KYNMOBI if you are taking certain medicines to treat nausea called 5HT3 antagonists, including ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron. People taking ondansetron together with apomorphine, the active ingredient in KYNMOBI, have had very low blood pressure and lost consciousness or “blacked out.”

Do not use KYNMOBI if you are allergic to apomorphine hydrochloride or to any of the ingredients in KYNMOBI. KYNMOBI also contains a sulfite called sodium metabisulfite. Sulfites can cause severe, life‐threatening allergic reactions in some people. An allergy to sulfites is not the same as an allergy to sulfa. People with asthma are more likely to be allergic to sulfites. Call your healthcare provider if you have hives, itching, rash, swelling of the lips, tongue and mouth, redness of your face (flushing), throat tightness, trouble breathing or swallowing.

Before starting KYNMOBI, tell your healthcare provider:

About all of your medical conditions, including if you:

● have difficulty staying awake during the daytime

● have liver problems

● have dizziness

● have kidney problems

● have fainting spells

● have heart problems

● have low blood pressure

● have had a stroke or other brain problems

● have asthma

● have a mental problem called a major psychotic disorder

● are allergic to any medicines containing sulfites

● drink alcohol

● are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if KYNMOBI will harm your unborn baby

● are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if KYNMOBI passes into your breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take KYNMOBI or breastfeed.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including:

● prescription medicines

● over-the-counter medicines

● vitamins

● herbal supplements

KYNMOBI may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines can affect how KYNMOBI works. Taking KYNMOBI with other medicines may cause serious side effects. If you take nitroglycerin under your tongue (sublingual) while using KYNMOBI, your blood pressure may decrease and cause dizziness. You should lie down before and after taking sublingual nitroglycerin.

KYNMOBI can cause serious side effects, including:

nausea and vomiting. Nausea is a common side effect of KYNMOBI. Nausea and vomiting can happen with KYNMOBI. Your healthcare provider may prescribe a medicine called an antiemetic, such as trimethobenzamide to help prevent nausea and vomiting.
sleepiness or falling asleep during the day. Sleepiness is a serious, and common side effect of KYNMOBI. Some people treated with KYNMOBI may get sleepy during the day or fall asleep without warning while doing everyday activities such as talking, eating, or driving a car.
dizziness. Dizziness is a serious, and common side effect of KYNMOBI. KYNMOBI may lower blood pressure and cause dizziness. Dizziness can happen when KYNMOBI treatment is started or when the KYNMOBI dose is increased. Do not get up too fast from sitting or after lying down, especially if you have been sitting or lying down for a long period of time.
mouth (oral) irritation. Mouth (oral) irritation is a common side effect of KYNMOBI. You should call your healthcare provider if you develop any of these signs or symptoms.
redness
mouth sores (ulceration)
dryness of the mouth, lips or tongue
swelling
pain
pain with swallowing
falls. The changes that can happen with PD, and the effects of some PD medicines, can increase the risk of falling. KYNMOBI may also increase your risk of falling.
hallucinations or psychotic-like behavior. KYNMOBI may cause or make psychotic-like behavior worse including hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real), confusion, excessive suspicion, aggressive behavior, agitation, delusional beliefs (believing things that are not real), and disorganized thinking.
strong (intense) urges. Some people with PD have reported new or strong uncontrollable urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, increased urges to spend money (compulsive shopping), and other intense urges, while taking PD medicines, including KYNMOBI. If you or your family members notice that you have strong urges, talk to your healthcare provider. The strong urges may go away if your KYNMOBI dose is lowered or stopped.
high fever and confusion. KYNMOBI may cause a problem that can happen in people who suddenly lower their dose, stop using, or change their dose of KYNMOBI. Symptoms include:
very high fever
confusion
stiff muscles
changes in breathing and heartbeat
Do not stop taking KYNMOBI or change your dose unless you are told to do so by your healthcare provider.

heart problems. If you have shortness of breath, fast heartbeat, chest pain, or feel like you are going to pass out (faint) while taking KYNMOBI, call your healthcare provider or get emergency help right away.
tissue changes (fibrotic complications). Some people have had changes in the tissues of their pelvis, lungs, and heart valves when taking medicines called nonergot derived dopamine agonists like KYNMOBI.
prolonged painful erections (priapism). KYNMOBI may cause prolonged, painful erections in some people. If you have a prolonged and painful erection, you should call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.
The most common side effects of KYNMOBI include:

nausea
dizziness
sleepiness
mouth swelling, pain, or sores
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

About Parkinson’s Disease and OFF Episodes

By 2030, it is estimated that 1.2 million people in the U.S. and an estimated 10 million people worldwide will be living with Parkinson’s disease (PD).1 PD is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms, including tremor at rest, rigidity and impaired movement, as well as significant non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment and mood disorders. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease3, and the prevalence of PD is increasing as the world’s population ages.

OFF episodes are the re-emergence or worsening of PD symptoms otherwise controlled with oral levodopa/carbidopa. These episodes may disrupt a person’s ability to perform everyday activities, can cause anxiety and may be burdensome for patients, family and care partners. OFF episodes are experienced by nearly 60 percent of people with PD within the first four to six years of diagnosis, and may worsen in frequency and severity over the course of the illness.2

35143,PRA Collaborates with Microsoft to Foster COVID-19 Monitoring,PRA Teams with Microsoft to Enhance COVID-19 Monitoring,"The collaboration allows Microsoft to integrate its Healthcare Bot service with PRA’s digital platform, providing users who enroll in the COVID-19 monitoring program the ability to use an AI-based chatbot, which responds to COVID-19-related questions, to enhance their own COVID-19 care
 The integration allows organizations that have implemented PRA’s COVID-19 monitoring program to understand the patient flow and to monitor, educate, and individualize care with greater agility
 PRA has rolled out the voluntary program and the Health Harmony mobile app, with the integrated Healthcare Bot service, to 7,000+ of its employees in the US. The COVID-19 monitoring program is available commercially to employers, payers, provider, and health systems and offers three levels of support: the educational program, the quarantine program, and the in-depth monitoring program","A new innovation has just been unveiled to this state-of-the-art commercial COVID-19 Monitoring Program. Microsoft’s Healthcare Bot service has been integrated into PRA’s innovative digital platform, providing users who enroll in the COVID-19 Monitoring Program the ability to use an AI-based chatbot, which can recognize and respond to COVID-19-related questions, to enhance their own COVID-19 care.

The chatbot compares users’ symptoms to U.S. Centers for Disease Control guidance and then recommends one of three available COVID-19 programs in which they should enroll. It achieves this through a series of conversational questions and interactions within PRA’s Health Harmony digital health platform

This makes the enrollment experience more personalized for users and is more accurate in determining what level of COVID-19 care is needed. Any information participants share is confidential. The integration allows organizations that have implemented PRA’s COVID-19 Monitoring Program to understand patient flow and to monitor, educate, and individualize care with greater agility.

“Collaborating closely with leading edge companies like Microsoft, PRA is uniquely positioned to deliver innovative new models of care to patients as their needs evolve, especially in times of crisis and uncertainty,” said Kent Thoelke, EVP and Chief Scientific Officer. “With PRA’s Health Harmony app in their hands, patients can track signs, symptoms and self-manage their own COVID-19-related care, but if symptoms escalate, remote monitoring and the help obtained from a healthcare professional can make all the difference. PRA is giving patients more control and better access to personalized healthcare, right from their own devices and on their own schedule.”

PRA recently rolled out the voluntary program and the Health Harmony mobile app, with the integrated Healthcare Bot service, to more than 7,000 of its employees in the United States. Since March, thousands of users from around the globe have downloaded the app and enrolled in the COVID-19 Monitoring Program.

It has been critically important to remain vigilant and take steps to stay healthy and informed throughout the pandemic. PRA has provided a vital tool to do so through the COVID-19 Monitoring Program. As part of the program, users have been tracking their own COVID-19 symptoms and educating themselves about the disease. The COVID-19 Monitoring Program – available commercially to employers, payers, providers and health systems – offers three levels of support:

The educational program, which provides vital sign tracking, prevention techniques and mental health support for those who are asymptomatic.
The quarantine program, which delivers insights on what to watch for, addresses feelings of fear and isolation, and connects with a healthcare professional for those who have been exposed to COVID-19.
The in-depth monitoring program, which addresses symptom management, frequent monitoring by a healthcare professional and care coordination for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are still at home.
“Healthcare and clinical research should be easily accessible to all people and tailored to fit their unique needs,” said Jean Gabarra, General Manager, Health AI at Microsoft. “When technology like Microsoft’s COVID-19 Healthcare Bot and a user-friendly interface like the Health Harmony app can be combined with the insights and expertise of a global healthcare intelligence partner like PRA, patients’ health and wellbeing will benefit tremendously.”",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PRA-Health.png,COVID-19|DigiHealth,PRA | Microsoft,AI-based chatbot,COVID-19|DigiHealth|Collaborates|Foster|Monitoring,publish,18/6/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/pra-teams-with-microsoft-to-enhance-covid-19-monitoring/,https://pharmashots.com/35143/pra-collaborates-with-microsoft-to-foster-covid-19-monitoring/

35155,AbbVie and Neurocrine's Oriahnn Receive the US FDA's Approval as the First Oral Therapy for the Management of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Due to Uterine Fibroids in Pre-menopausal Women,FDA Approves the First Oral Medication for the Management of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Due to Uterine Fibroids in Pre-menopausal Women,"The approval follows P-III ELARIS UF-I and ELARIS UF-II studies assessing Oriahnn (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules) vs PBO for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women for up to 24mos.
 The study met its 1EPs of clinically meaningful reduction in bleeding (defined as the proportion of women who achieved both at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss at final month of treatment and a total menstrual blood loss amount of < 80 ml), 7/ 10 vs 1/10 women no longer experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding, reduction in bleeding due to uterine fibroids by 50% within the first month of use
 The approval provides women with a non-surgical option addressing unresolved heavy menstrual bleeding. The therapy is expected to be available in the US by the end of Jun’2020","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., May 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), in cooperation with Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: NBIX), announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ORIAHNN™ (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules), with a treatment duration of up to 24 months.2 ORIAHNN is the first FDA-approved non-surgical, oral medication option for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women.2 ORIAHNN is expected to be available in the U.S. by the end of June 2020.

“Women who experience heavy menstrual bleeding as a symptom not only deal with the physical toll of uterine fibroids, but also the burdens surrounding its management while trying to get through with their day-to-day routines,” said Ayman Al-Hendy, M.D., Ph.D., investigator for the ELARIS UF-2 clinical trials, and professor of gynecology and director of translational research at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “This approval provides women with a non-surgical option to help address unresolved heavy menstrual bleeding in an impactful way.”

Uterine fibroids, also called leiomyomas, are estrogen and progesterone-dependent non-cancerous tumors of the uterus and are the most common type of benign tumor in women of reproductive age, affecting up to 70 percent of Caucasian women and up to 80 percent of African American women by age 50.1,3,4,5,6,7 Traditionally, uterine fibroids have been primarily managed by surgery and are the leading reason for the hysterectomies performed in the U.S.1,3,5,8

“It is always deeply rewarding when the years of development our researchers and scientists dedicate to creating a new way to treat patients is successful,” said Michael Severino, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. “ORIAHNN signifies an important advance in how we can care for women with uterine fibroids.”

In the two, randomized Phase 3 uterine fibroid clinical trials, ELARIS UF-I and ELARIS UF-II, ORIAHNN achieved the primary endpoint of clinically meaningful reduction in bleeding (defined as the proportion of women who achieved both at least a 50 percent reduction in menstrual blood loss at final month of treatment and a total menstrual blood loss amount of less than 80 ml), compared with placebo in final month of study for patients, with seven out of 10 women no longer experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding versus one out of 10 women on placebo (P<0.001 for both trials).9 ORIAHNN also reduced heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids by 50 percent within the first month of use.9 The results from these studies were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

ORIAHNN may increase your chances of heart attack, stroke, or blood clots, especially if you are a smoker over 35 years of age with high blood pressure.2 Please see the important safety information below for more information. ORIAHNN is taken twice daily (morning and evening) at approximately the same time each day, with or without food. Use of ORIAHNN should be limited to 24 months due to the risk of continued bone loss, which may not be reversible.2

“We have heard from women with fibroids across the country who have been hopeful for a treatment with the potential to address their bleeding effectively,” said Jenny Rosenberg, executive director of CARE About Fibroids. “The FDA’s approval of an oral treatment for women suffering from heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids marks a step forward in women’s health.”10

Uterine fibroids (also called leiomyomas or myomas) are non-cancerous, hormonally-responsive muscle tissue tumors of the uterus.1,3 Fibroids are the most common type of abnormal growth in a woman’s pelvis and can affect up to 70 percent of Caucasian women and up to 80 of African American women by age 50.1,3,4,5,6,7 Fibroids can range in size, shape, number and location.5 Fibroids can be asymptomatic but, in some women, they can cause symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding.3,4,5 Treatment options for uterine fibroids include surgery (hysterectomy, myomectomy), endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound and medical management with treatments such as oral contraceptives, progestins, selective progesterone receptor modulators, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists.1,9

About ORIAHNNTM (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules)
ORIAHNN is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an oral medication for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women.2 ORIAHNN is an oral combination of elagolix and E2/NETA (estradiol/norethindrone acetate) to help achieve a balance between the reduction of heavy bleeding and associated hypoestrogenic side effects.2

The full U.S. prescribing information, including the medication guide, for ORIAHNN can be found on rxabbvie.com.

USE

ORIAHNN™ (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules) is a prescription medicine used to control heavy menstrual bleeding related to uterine fibroids in women before menopause. It should not be taken for more than 24 months. It is not known if ORIAHNN is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

What is the most important information I should know about ORIAHNN?
ORIAHNN may cause serious side effects, including:

Cardiovascular Conditions
ORIAHNN may increase your chances of heart attack, stroke, or blood clots, especially if you are over 35 years of age and smoke, have uncontrolled high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or are obese. Stop taking ORIAHNN and call your healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have:
Leg pain or swelling that will not go away
Sudden shortness of breath
Double vision, bulging of the eyes, or sudden blindness (partial or complete)
Pain or pressure in your chest, arm, or jaw
Sudden, severe headache unlike your usual headaches
Weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, or trouble speaking
Bone Loss (Decreased Bone Mineral Density [BMD])
While taking ORIAHNN, your estrogen levels may be low. Low estrogen levels can lead to BMD loss.
If you have bone loss on ORIAHNN, your BMD may improve after you stop taking ORIAHNN, but complete recovery may not occur. It is unknown if these BMD changes could increase your risk for broken bones as you age. For this reason, you should not take ORIAHNN for more than 24 months.
Your healthcare provider may order an X-ray test called a DXA scan to check your bone mineral density when you start taking ORIAHNN and periodically after you start.
Your doctor may advise you to take vitamin D and calcium supplements as part of a healthy lifestyle.
Effects on Pregnancy
Do not take ORIAHNN if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, as it may increase the risk of early pregnancy loss.
If you think you may be pregnant, stop taking ORIAHNN right away and call your HCP.
ORIAHNN can decrease your menstrual bleeding or result in no menstrual bleeding at all, making it hard to know if you are pregnant. Watch for other pregnancy signs like breast tenderness, weight gain, and nausea.
ORIAHNN does not prevent pregnancy. You will need to use effective methods of birth control while taking ORIAHNN and for 1 week after you stop taking ORIAHNN. Examples of effective methods can include condoms or spermicide, which do not contain hormones.
Talk to your HCP about which birth control to use during treatment with ORIAHNN. Your HCP may change the birth control you are on before you start taking ORIAHNN.
Do not take ORIAHNN if you:

Have or have had:
A stroke or heart attack
A problem that makes your blood clot more than normal
Blood circulation disorder
Certain heart valve problems or heart rhythm abnormalities that can cause blood clots to form in the heart
Blood clots in your legs (deep vein thrombosis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes (retinal thrombosis)
High blood pressure not well controlled by medicine
Diabetes with kidney, eye, nerve, or blood vessel damage
Certain kinds of headaches with numbness, weakness, or changes in vision, or have migraine headaches with aura if you are over age 35
Breast cancer or any cancer that is sensitive to female hormones
Osteoporosis
Unexplained vaginal bleeding that has not been diagnosed
Liver problems including liver disease
Smoke and are over 35 years old
Are taking medicines known as strong OATP1B1 inhibitors that are known or expected to significantly increase the blood levels of elagolix. Ask your HCP if you are not sure if you are taking this type of medicine.
Have had a serious allergic reaction to elagolix, estradiol, norethindrone acetate, or any of the ingredients in ORIAHNN. Ask your HCP if you are not sure.
FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) is an ingredient in ORIAHNN, which may cause an allergic type reaction such as bronchial asthma in some patients who are also allergic to aspirin.
What should I discuss with my HCP before taking ORIAHNN?
Tell your HCP about all your medical conditions, including if you:

Have or have had:
Broken bones or other conditions that may cause bone problems
Depression, mood swings, or suicidal thoughts or behavior
Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) or jaundice caused by pregnancy (cholestasis of pregnancy)
Are scheduled for surgery. ORIAHNN may increase your risk of blood clots after surgery. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking ORIAHNN before you have surgery. If this happens, talk to your HCP about when to restart ORIAHNN after surgery.
Are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.
Are breastfeeding. It is not known if ORIAHNN can pass into your breastmilk. Talk to your HCP about the best way to feed your baby if you take ORIAHNN.
Tell your HCP about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Women on thyroid or cortisol replacement therapy may need increased doses of the hormone.

Keep a list of your medicines with you to show to your HCP and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

What should I avoid while taking ORIAHNN?

Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice during treatment with ORIAHNN since they may affect the level of ORIAHNN in your blood, which may increase side effects.
What are the possible side effects of ORIAHNN?
ORIAHNN can cause additional serious side effects, including:

Suicidal thoughts, suicidal behavior, and worsening of mood. ORIAHNN may cause suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your HCP or get emergency medical help right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or bother you: thoughts about suicide or dying, attempts to commit suicide, new or worse depression or anxiety, or other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in your mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings.
Abnormal liver tests. Call your HCP right away if you have any of these signs and symptoms of liver problems: jaundice, dark amber-colored urine, feeling tired, nausea and vomiting, generalized swelling, right upper stomach area pain, or bruising easily.
High blood pressure. You should see your HCP to check your blood pressure regularly.
Gallbladder problems (cholestasis), especially if you had cholestasis of pregnancy.
Increases in blood sugar, cholesterol, and fat (triglyceride) levels.
Hair loss (alopecia). Hair loss and hair thinning can happen while taking ORIAHNN, and it can continue even after you stop taking ORIAHNN. It is not known if this hair loss or hair thinning is reversible. Talk to your HCP if this is a concern for you.
Changes in laboratory tests, including thyroid and other hormone, cholesterol, and blood clotting tests.
The most common side effects of ORIAHNN include: hot flashes, headache, fatigue, and irregular periods.

These are not all of the possible side effects of ORIAHNN. Tell your HCP if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. Call your HCP for medical advice about side effects.

Take ORIAHNN exactly as your HCP tells you. The recommended oral dosage of ORIAHNN is one yellow/white capsule in the morning and one blue/white capsule in the evening, with or without food.

This is the most important information to know about ORIAHNN. For more information, talk to your doctor or HCP.

SEATTLE & NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Jun. 18, 2020– Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALPN), a leading clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on developing innovative treatments for cancer and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases, and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced an exclusive worldwide option and license agreement for ALPN-101, a first-in-class dual CD28/ICOS costimulation antagonist.

CD28 and ICOS are key costimulatory molecules that likely play critical roles in multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. ALPN-101 is a potent inhibitor of both CD28 and ICOS pathways with demonstrated efficacy in multiple preclinical disease models, superior to blockade of either pathway alone. Favorable safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been observed in a first-in-human study in adult healthy volunteers.

“We are very pleased to partner ALPN-101 with AbbVie, a world leader in the development and commercialization of innovative immunology therapies,” said Mitchell H. Gold, M.D., Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alpine Immune Sciences. “AbbVie is an ideal partner for ALPN-101, with the therapeutic area expertise, R&D commitment, and global resources needed to maximize ALPN-101’s potential for patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Today’s agreement validates our unique Directed Evolution platform that has yielded multiple product candidates, including ALPN-101. We look forward to working with our colleagues at AbbVie to potentially transform clinical outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease with currently few appealing treatment options.” 

“AbbVie’s expertise in Immunology has led to remarkable breakthroughs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases,” said Tom Hudson, M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie. “ALPN-101’s dual mechanism of action has compelling potential as a next-generation treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases. We are excited to partner with the team at Alpine on the development of this novel therapeutic.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Alpine will receive an upfront payment of $60 million, and will also be eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $805 million for exercise of the option and success-based development, regulatory and commercial milestones. In addition, Alpine is eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of ALPN-101. In exchange, AbbVie will receive an option to an exclusive license for ALPN-101. During the option period, Alpine will conduct a phase 2 study in systemic lupus erythematosus. Upon exercise of the option, AbbVie will conduct all future clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for ALPN-101.

Alpine Immune Sciences will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the option and license agreement and outline the company’s strategic focus moving forward.

 The company plans to conduct the study in 40+ clinical sites across Russia, Italy, the UK, and additional countries with 1EPs as the proportion of patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation by Day 14
 The study follows the ongoing P-IIa study assessing Opaganib in the US and will enroll 40 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring hospitalization and supplemental oxygen. Additionally, the company reported the encouraging preliminary findings of the therapy from six COVID-19 patients requiring high-flow supplemental oxygen in Israel under compassionate use","The multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical study with opaganib in 270 severe COVID-19 patients is planned to be conducted in up to 40 clinical sites across Russia, Italy, the UK and additional countries

—

In parallel, a clinical study of opaganib in up to 40 severe COVID-19 patients has been approved by the FDA and is open for recruitment in the U.S.

TEL-AVIV, Israel and RALEIGH, N.C., June 18, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (Nasdaq: RDHL) (“RedHill” or the “Company”), a specialty biopharmaceutical company, today announced that it has submitted Clinical Trial Applications (CTA) with the UK Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) for a Phase 2/3 clinical study evaluating opaganib (Yeliva®, ABC294640)1 in patients hospitalized with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19, and pneumonia.

Mark L. Levitt, M.D., Ph.D., Medical Director at RedHill, said: “We are quickly advancing the preparations for a global, multi-center powered Phase 2/3 study with opaganib for COVID-19. In line with the global shift from a focus on compassionate use programs to adequately controlled clinical studies, our highest priority is on generating robust data in a controlled setting for regulatory purposes. Following our submission of the Clinical Trial Application in Russia last week, we have submitted similar applications in the UK and Italy, and we are looking to expand the study to additional countries and start treating patients soon. This study, along with the ongoing Phase 2a study in the U.S., should allow us to enroll patients faster to evaluate the efficacy of opaganib against COVID-19 and bring this promising therapy one step closer to those who need it.”

The multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 study is planned to enroll up to 270 subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring hospitalization and treatment with supplemental oxygen. Subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either opaganib or placebo, on top of standard-of-care therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the proportion of patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation by Day 14. An unblinded futility interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 100 subjects have been evaluated for the primary endpoint.

The Company currently plans to conduct the study in up to 40 clinical sites across Russia, Italy, the UK and additional countries.

In parallel, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical study with opaganib in the U.S. is open for recruitment (NCT04414618). This study is set to enroll up to 40 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring hospitalization and supplemental oxygen. This clinical trial is not powered for statistical significance.

The Company previously announced encouraging preliminary findings from six COVID-19 patients requiring high-flow supplemental oxygen treated with opaganib in Israel under compassionate use. All six patients analyzed demonstrated pronounced clinical improvement following treatment initiation with opaganib, substantial improvement in biomarkers, including decreased required supplemental oxygen, higher lymphocyte counts and decreased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. All six patients analyzed were weaned from supplemental oxygen and discharged from the hospital on room air without having to receive mechanical ventilation.

To date, a total of 141 subjects have been dosed with opaganib in ongoing and completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies in oncology indications, in pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers in the U.S., under the existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved expanded access requests for oncology patients and under the expanded access for COVID-19 patients in Israel, establishing safety and tolerability in humans both in the U.S. and ex-U.S.

About Opaganib (ABC294640, Yeliva®)
Opaganib, a new chemical entity, is a proprietary, first-in-class, orally-administered, sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2) selective inhibitor with anticancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities, targeting multiple oncology, inflammatory and gastrointestinal indications. By inhibiting SK2, opaganib blocks the synthesis of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid-signaling molecule that promotes cancer growth and pathological inflammation.

Pre-clinical data have demonstrated both anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities of opaganib, with the potential to reduce lung inflammatory disorders, such as pneumonia, and mitigate pulmonary fibrotic damage. Several prior pre-clinical studies support the potential role of SK2 in the replication-transcription complex of positive-strand single-stranded RNA viruses, similar to SARS-CoV-2, and its inhibition may potentially inhibit viral replication. Pre-clinical in vivo studies2 have demonstrated that opaganib decreased fatality rates from influenza-virus infection and ameliorated Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced lung injury by reducing the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids.

Opaganib received Orphan Drug designation from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma and is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2a in advanced cholangiocarcinoma and in a Phase 2 study in prostate cancer. Opaganib was originally developed by U.S.-based Apogee Biotechnology Corp. and completed multiple successful pre-clinical studies in oncology, inflammation, GI and radioprotection models, as well as a Phase 1 clinical study in cancer patients with advanced solid tumors. Opaganib is also being evaluated for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19).

The development of opaganib has been supported by grants and contracts from U.S. federal and state government agencies awarded to Apogee Biotechnology Corp., including from the NCI, BARDA, the U.S. Department of Defense and the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development.

 In Jan’2020, Innovent granted commercial rights of Byvasda to in the US and Canada to Coherus BioSciences. Byvasda is a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF mAb targeting VEGF receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, thus inhibiting signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt/PKB and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK","19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar), a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug independently developed by Innovent, has been officially approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer in China. BYVASDA® is Innovent’s second monoclonal antibody drug approved by the NMPA following TYVYT® (sintilimab injection, officially approved for treatment of patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in December 2018).

In recent years, the cancer burden in China has been continuously increasing. According to the report of Cancer Today from the WHO’s International Agency for Cancer Research, there were 4.285 million newly diagnosed cancer patients and 2.865 million deaths from cancer in China in 2018. Among the malignant tumors in China, lung cancer ranks first both in incidence rate (0.774 million newly diagnosed patients) and mortality rate (0.691 million deaths). Colorectal cancer ranks second in incidence rate (0.517 million newly diagnosed patients) and fifth in mortality rate (0.245 million deaths). Since the launch of bevacizumab, it has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, and in China it was approved for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab have been well recognized worldwide. Currently there still remains huge unmet clinical demand for bevacizumab treatment in China, as many ordinary Chinese patients cannot afford for it. BYVASDA® is an anti-VEGF humanized monoclonal antibody and a bevacizumab biosimilar independently developed by Innovent. The launch of BYVASDA® will provide Chinese patients with high-quality and relatively more affordable bevacizumab biosimilar injection.

Dr. Hui Zhou, Vice President and Head of Oncology Strategy and Medical Sciences of Innovent, stated: “BYVASDA® is another example of our success with the National Major New Drug Innovation and Development Projects and the second monoclonal antibody drug approved by the NMPA following TYVYT® (sintilimab injection). We hope to bring this high-quality and cost-saving drugs to more patients in need in China as soon as possible. In January 2020, Innovent out-licensed the commercial rights of BYVASDA® in the United States and Canada to Coherus BioSciences, a leading biosimilar company, demonstrated an international recognition of the quality of BYVASDA®. We are looking forward to working together to make BYVASDA® benefit more patients globally.”

About BYVASDA®

BYVASDA® is a bevacizumab biosimilar and a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important factor in angiogenesis that is highly expressed by the endothelial cells in most human tumors. An anti-VEGF antibody binds VEGF selectively with high affinity and blocks its binding to VEGF receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt/PKB and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK. BYVASDA® produces anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the growth, proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, blocking angiogenesis, reducing vascular permeability, blocking blood supply to tumor tissues, inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Since the launch of bevacizumab, it has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab have been well recognized worldwide.

June 18, 2020 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
NEW YORK & BRISBANE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:SGMO), a genomic medicines company, today announced updated follow-up data from the Phase 1/2 Alta study of giroctocogene fitelparvovec (SB-525, or PF-07055480), an investigational gene therapy for patients with severe hemophilia A. All five patients with severe hemophilia A who received the 3e13 vg/kg dose showed sustained factor VIII (FVIII) activity levels, with a median of 64.2% via chromogenic assay (patient-level geometric means after week 9 post-infusion). No patients experienced bleeding events or required FVIII infusions. The factor VIII activity levels reflect measurements up to 61 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest-treated patient in the cohort. These data are being presented today as a late-breaking oral abstract at the World Federation of Hemophilia 2020 World Congress, which is being held virtually from June 14 to June 19, 2020.

“These follow-up data indicate that treatment with giroctocogene fitelparvovec resulted in sustained factor levels up to 14 months following treatment and suggests the potential of this investigational gene therapy to alleviate the treatment burden of current hemophilia disease management.”

Giroctocogene fitelparvovec was generally well tolerated. As previously reported, one patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort had a treatment-related serious adverse event of hypotension (grade 3) and fever (grade 2), with symptoms of headache and tachycardia, which occurred six hours post-infusion with giroctocogene fitelparvovec, and which fully resolved within 24 hours. No other treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. Among the five patients in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort, four received corticosteroids for liver enzyme (alanine aminotransferase, ALT) elevations. Three patients had subsequent ALT elevations that responded to corticosteroids. All episodes of ALT elevations fully resolved with oral corticosteroids.

“We are excited that these data affirm previous findings from this Phase 1/2 study, and that all five patients have sustained levels of factor VIII activity with no bleeding events or use of factor replacement therapy. We are encouraged by the potential of giroctocogene fitelparvovec to demonstrate longer-term durability, an important element for patients living with severe hemophilia A,” said Seng Cheng, Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer’s Rare Disease Research Unit. “The Phase 3 lead in study is ongoing, and we look forward to dosing patients with this investigational gene therapy in the pivotal Phase 3 trial later this year.”

“The current standard of care for severe hemophilia A requires regular infusions to replace missing Factor VIII. Gene therapy, on the other hand, offers a new approach with the potential to provide a one-time treatment that would enable patients to produce the missing factor on their own,” said Bettina M. Cockroft, M.D., M.B.A., Chief Medical Officer of Sangamo. “These follow-up data indicate that treatment with giroctocogene fitelparvovec resulted in sustained factor levels up to 14 months following treatment and suggests the potential of this investigational gene therapy to alleviate the treatment burden of current hemophilia disease management.”

The additional follow-up builds on data presented at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in December 2019, which demonstrated that giroctocogene fitelparvovec was generally well tolerated and resulted in sustained FVIII levels up to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest-treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort at that time. The previously presented data included 11 patients treated across four ascending dose cohorts: 9e11 vg/kg (2 patients), 2e12 vg/kg (2 patients), 1e13 vg/kg (2 patients) and 3e13 vg/kg (5 patients). Pfizer and Sangamo plan to present further follow-up data from the Alta study when all five patients in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort have been followed for at least one year.

About the Alta study

The Phase 1/2 Alta study is an open-label, dose-ranging, multicenter clinical trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of giroctocogene fitelparvovec in patients with severe hemophilia A. The mean age of the 11 patients assessed across four dose cohorts is 30 years (range 18-47 years). All 11 patients are male. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Orphan Drug, Fast Track, and regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designations to giroctocogene fitelparvovec, which also received Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European Medicines Agency. Giroctocogene fitelparvovec is being developed as part of a collaboration agreement for the global development and commercialization of gene therapies for hemophilia A between Sangamo and Pfizer.

About giroctocogene fitelparvovec

Giroctocogene fitelparvovec (SB-525 or PF-07055480), comprises a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 vector (AAV6) encoding the complementary deoxyribonucleic acid for B domain deleted human FVIII. The giroctocogene fitelparvovec expression cassette was designed for optimal liver-specific expression of FVIII protein and supports production of high yields of the vector. The giroctocogene fitelparvovec transcriptional cassette incorporates multi-factorial modifications to the liver-specific promoter module, FVIII transgene, synthetic polyadenylation signal and vector backbone sequence.

In late 2019, Sangamo transferred the manufacturing technology and the Investigational New Drug (IND) application to Pfizer. Pfizer is enrolling patients in the Phase 3 lead-in study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03587116), the data from which is expected to provide a baseline for patients who are subsequently enrolled into the pivotal Phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04370054). The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 study is annualized bleeding rate (ABR) over 12 months, and secondary endpoints include steady state FVIII activity levels, annualized infusion rate of exogenous FVIII activity, annualized FVIII consumption, ABR and total ABR of specific type by cause and by location, and change in joint health using Hemophilia Joint Health Score, over 12 months.

(Kyowa Kirin, TSE: 4151), a global specialty pharmaceutical company creating innovative medical solutions using the latest biotechnology, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Crysvita® (burosumab) for the treatment of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)-related hypophosphatemia in tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors that cannot be curatively resected or localized in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Crysvita is a human antibody that blocks excess activity of FGF23, a hormone that causes phosphate urinary excretion and suppresses active vitamin D production by the kidney.

“For approximately half of all individuals with TIO, surgical removal of the tumors is not possible, leaving these patients with no other treatment options. The FDA approval of Crysvita marks the first treatment option that addresses the cause of the severe hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia resulting from these rare tumors,” said Camille L. Bedrosian, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Ultragenyx. “We plan to leverage our experience and existing infrastructure with Crysvita in X-linked hypophosphatemia to bring this important medicine to patients living with the rare, painful and debilitating disorder of TIO.”

“Since its approval, Crysvita has meant a great deal to patients and families that previously had no other treatment options. We are proud of the work that has been done to advance this discovery from our labs, through a robust clinical research program, and through the FDA’s priority review process, to make this treatment available to patients with TIO,” said Gary Zieziula, President, North America for Kyowa Kirin. “Our commitment to meeting the needs of patients with rare and serious diseases remains steadfast and we will continue to partner with the Ultragenyx team to address these needs with urgency.”

TIO is a rare disease caused by typically benign, slow-growing tumors that produce excess levels of FGF23, which is involved in phosphate reabsorption. Patients with TIO can experience symptoms including severe hypophosphatemia (low levels of phosphate in the blood), osteomalacia (softening of the bones), muscle weakness, fatigue, bone pain and fractures. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000 people in the United States with TIO, and approximately half of all cases are believed to be inoperable. In patients for whom the tumor or lesion is inoperable, the current treatment consists of oral phosphate and/or active vitamin D replacement. Efficacy of this management is often limited, and its benefits must be balanced with monitoring for potential risks.

This is the second FDA-approved indication for Crysvita, which was first approved in April 2018 for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) in adult and pediatric patients one year of age and older. The XLH indication was expanded in September 2019 to include infants as young as six months of age.

The FDA approval of Crysvita for TIO was based on data from two single-arm Phase 2 studies, a 144-week study in 14 adult patients conducted by Ultragenyx in the United States and an 88-week study in 13 adult patients conducted by Kyowa Kirin in Japan and South Korea. In both studies, Crysvita was associated with increases in serum phosphorus and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Increased phosphate levels led to improvements in osteomalacia. Additionally, whole body bone scans demonstrated reduced tracer uptake with long-term treatment suggesting healing of bone lesions. Most common adverse reactions (>10%) in TIO patients are: tooth abscess, muscle spasms, dizziness, constipation, injection site reaction, rash, and headache.

The FDA granted Priority Review designation for the supplemental BLA for TIO, which is reserved for drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness.

To support access, Ultragenyx has a program called UltraCare™, which helps patients and caregivers understand insurance coverage and assists them in finding financial support for Ultragenyx medicines including Crysvita, and for the administration of them. Dedicated in-house UltraCare Guides are available Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Time at 888-756-8657.

About Crysvita
Crysvita (burosumab-twza) is a recombinant fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody, discovered by Kyowa Kirin, against the phosphaturic hormone FGF23. FGF23 is a hormone that reduces serum levels of phosphorus and active vitamin D by regulating phosphate excretion and active vitamin D production by the kidney. Phosphate wasting in TIO and other hypophosphatemic conditions, including XLH, is caused by excessive levels and activity of FGF23. Crysvita is designed to bind to and thereby inhibit the biological activity of FGF23. By blocking excess FGF23 in patients with TIO and XLH, Crysvita is intended to increase phosphate reabsorption from the kidney and increase the production of active vitamin D, which enhances intestinal absorption of phosphate and calcium.

Crysvita is approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) in adult and pediatric patients six months of age and older and FGF23-related hypophosphatemia in tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors that cannot be curatively resected or localized in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older, and by Health Canada and Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) for the treatment of XLH in adult and pediatric patients one year of age and older. In Japan, it is approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for the treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets and osteomalacia. In Europe, Crysvita has received European conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of XLH with radiographic evidence of bone disease in children 1 year of age and older and adolescents with growing skeletons, and an application for the expanded use in adults with XLH is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency.

Kyowa Kirin and Ultragenyx have been collaborating in the development and commercialization of Crysvita globally based on the collaboration and license agreement between the parties.

– The approval’s restricted use entails responsible medication use where every patient must have signed informed consent before treatment initiation

– Favipiravir shows clinical improvements of up to 88% in COVID-19, with rapid reduction in viral load by 4 days

– Clinical improvement noted across age groups 20 to >90 years, including in patients with co-morbid conditions like diabetes and heart disease suffering from mild to moderate COVID-19

– Glenmark to market the antiviral under the brand name ‘FabiFlu®’

MUMBAI, India, June 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — In a landmark development for COVID-19 patients in India, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, a research-led, integrated global pharmaceutical company, today announced the launch of antiviral drug Favipiravir (brand name FabiFlu®) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. Glenmark has received manufacturing and marketing approval from India’s drug regulator, making FabiFlu® the first oral Favipiravir-approved medication in India for the treatment of COVID-19.

Favipiravir is backed by strong clinical evidence showing encouraging results in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The antiviral offers broad spectrum RNA virus coverage2 with clinical improvement noted across age groups 20 to >90 years.3 Favipiravir can be used in COVID-19 patients with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and heart disease with mild to moderate COVID 19 symptoms.3 It offers rapid reduction in viral load within 4 days1,4 and provides faster symptomatic and radiological improvement.1,4,5 Of most importance, Favipiravir has shown clinical improvement of up to 88% in COVID-19 mild to moderate COVID 19 cases.3

Glenmark successfully developed the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and the formulation for FabiFlu® through its own in-house R&D team. Glenmark filed the product for clinical trial with India’s drug regulator DCGI and became the first pharmaceutical company in India to receive approval for conducting phase 3 clinical trial on mild to moderate COVID-19 patients.

Commenting on the significance of this development, Mr. Glenn Saldanha, Chairman and Managing Director of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., said, “This approval comes at a time when cases in India are spiralling like never before, putting a tremendous pressure on our healthcare system. We hope the availability of an effective treatment such as FabiFlu® will considerably help assuage this pressure, and offer patients in India a much needed and timely therapy option.” 

He added, “FabiFlu® has demonstrated an encouraging response in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients during clinical trials. Moreover, it is orally administered, and so it serves as a more convenient treatment option over other intravenously administered medications. Glenmark will work closely with the government and medical community to make FabiFlu® quickly accessible to patients across the country.”

Favipiravir is approved in Japan since 2014 for the treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections. It has a unique mechanism of action: it is converted into an active phosphoribosylated form (favipiravir-RTP) in cells and recognized as a substrate by viral RNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting RNA polymerase activity.

Most patients exhibiting mild to moderate symptoms can benefit from FabiFlu® use. The drug will be available as a prescription-based medication for INR 103/tablet, with recommended dose being 1800 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by 800 mg twice daily up to day 14.

Earlier last month, Glenmark also announced that it is conducting another clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of two antivirals Favipiravir and Umifenovir as a combination therapy in moderate hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients in India.

 Following the completion of the application, the EMA will now initiate the review procedure. The study resulted in improving OS which was presented at ASCO20
 Bavencio is a human PD-L1 mAb, acts by blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors. In early 2020, the US FDA has accepted the sBLA for 1L treatment of patients with LA or metastatic UC for PR under the FDA’s RTOR pilot program. The FDA has granted BT designation to Bavencio for the same indication","Merck and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated for review the Type II variation application for BAVENCIO® (avelumab) for first-line maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC). With this validation, the application is complete, and the EMA will now begin the review procedure.

The application is based on results from the Phase III JAVELIN Bladder 100 study, which showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) for BAVENCIO plus best supportive care (BSC) as first-line maintenance treatment following induction chemotherapy versus BSC alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. The data were presented at the ASCO 2020 Virtual Scientific Meeting.

In the European Union alone, nearly 200,000 people are diagnosed each year with bladder cancer.1 Urothelial carcinoma accounts for approximately 90 percent of bladder cancers.2 Urothelial carcinoma becomes harder to treat as it advances, spreading through the layers of the bladder wall.3 Despite available therapies, more than 60,000 Europeans die from bladder cancer each year.1

Earlier this year, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for first-line maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC for Priority Review under the agency’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program. The FDA also granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to BAVENCIO for this indication.

In addition, a supplemental new drug application has also been accepted by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for BAVENCIO as a first-line maintenance therapy for locally advanced or metastatic UC.

About JAVELIN Bladder 100

JAVELIN Bladder 100 (NCT02603432) is a Phase III, multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study investigating first-line maintenance treatment with BAVENCIO plus BSC versus BSC alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. A total of 700 patients whose disease had not progressed after platinum-based induction chemotherapy as per RECIST v1.1 were randomly assigned to receive either BAVENCIO plus BSC or BSC alone. The primary endpoint was OS in the two primary populations of all patients and patients with PD-L1+ tumors defined by the Ventana SP263 assay.

About BAVENCIO® (avelumab)

BAVENCIO is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. BAVENCIO has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, BAVENCIO has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.4-6 In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize BAVENCIO.

BAVENCIO Approved Indications

The European Commission has authorized the use of BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In September 2017, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for BAVENCIO as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).

In the US, BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Additionally, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

BAVENCIO is currently approved for patients with MCC in 50 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.

BAVENCIO Safety Profile from the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)

The special warnings and precautions for use for BAVENCIO monotherapy include infusion-related reactions, as well as immune-related adverse reactions that include pneumonitis and hepatitis (including fatal cases), colitis, pancreatitis (including fatal cases), myocarditis (including fatal cases), endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, and other immune-related adverse reactions. The special warnings and precautions for use for BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib include hepatotoxicity.

The SmPC list of the most common adverse reactions with BAVENCIO monotherapy in patients with solid tumors includes fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, constipation, infusion-related reactions, weight decreased and vomiting.

Novartis remains committed to ongoing research and development for COVID-19
Supply of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) from Novartis will continue for clinical trials and upon government requests worldwide
Basel, June 19, 2020 — Novartis has made the decision to stop and discontinue its sponsored HCQ clinical trial for COVID-19 due to acute enrollment challenges that have made trial completion infeasible. The recruitment challenge facing our HCQ trial has made it unlikely that the clinical team will be able to collect meaningful data in a reasonable timeframe to determine the effectiveness of HCQ in treating patients with COVID-19. No safety issues have been reported, and there are no conclusions on efficacy from the study.

Novartis will continue to provide supply of HCQ for ongoing investigator-initiated trials (IITs) and upon government requests, as appropriate, where certain conditions are met and the medicine is used in accordance with a nationally endorsed treatment protocol. Researchers at Novartis continue to monitor ongoing guidance from health authorities on the further study of HCQ for COVID-19, as well as the decision by the US Food and Drug Administration to stop the emergency use authorization of HCQ for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, ongoing studies involving other Novartis treatments continue, as well as the newly announced support of a potential vaccine. Novartis also continues to collaborate to find answers for COVID-19 through various partnerships with multi-stakeholder external consortia.

Novartis wishes to thank all of the patients, their families, investigators and healthcare professionals who played a vital part in our HCQ clinical trial (CJWT629A12301, NCT04358081) for COVID-19.

June 22, 2020 06:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time
KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10) as determined by a fully validated test, following failure of one prior line of systemic therapy. This new indication was granted full approval based on the overall survival (OS) findings from the global Phase 3 KEYNOTE-181 trial, including data from an extension of the global study in Chinese patients. With this new approval, KEYTRUDA is now approved for five indications across three different types of cancer in China, including as a first-line treatment for appropriate patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy) and as a second-line treatment for advanced melanoma. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in July 2019 was based upon the global KEYNOTE-181 trial.

“In China, more than 90% of esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, and patients with advanced types of this disease face a poor prognosis and have few treatment options,” said Dr. Shen Lin, vice president of Clinical Oncology at Beijing Cancer Hospital and Peking University and deputy director of Beijing Institute for Cancer Research. “This approval represents an important advancement for certain patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who now have an immunotherapy treatment option.”

In the KEYNOTE-181 trial, an improvement in OS was observed in patients who were treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy compared with chemotherapy in previously treated patients with recurrent or metastatic ESCC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥10) (HR=0.64 [95% CI, 0.46-0.90]). The median OS was 10.3 months for KEYTRUDA compared with 6.7 months for chemotherapy.

In the extension of the KEYNOTE-181 study in Chinese patients, consistent with the KEYNOTE-181 global study, there was an improvement in OS for patients who were treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy compared with chemotherapy in previously treated patients with recurrent or metastatic ESCC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥10) (HR=0.38 [95% CI, 0.19-0.77]). The median OS was 12.0 months for KEYTRUDA compared with 5.4 months for chemotherapy.

“In China, there is a high incidence of esophageal cancer, and it is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “This approval for KEYTRUDA provides an important new option for certain patients with esophageal carcinoma in China, where there have been few treatment advances in recent years.”

“The approval for patients with second-line esophageal squamous cell carcinoma marks the fifth indication for KEYTRUDA across three different types of cancer in China,” said Joseph Romanelli, president of MSD in China. “With each approval, we’ve made steady progress to ensure patients have access to KEYTRUDA, and we will ensure the same for patients who are impacted by esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.”

About Esophageal Cancer in China

Esophageal cancer, a type of cancer that is particularly difficult to treat, begins in the inner layer (mucosa) of the esophagus and grows outward. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. In China, 90% of all esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Globally, esophageal cancer is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer. Worldwide, it was estimated there were more than 572,000 new cases of esophageal cancer and nearly 509,000 deaths resulting from the disease in 2018. In China, esophageal cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer and is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions

Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

35374,Gilead to Initiate P-I Study Evaluating Inhaled Version of Remedesivir Against COVID-19 in August 2020,"An Open Letter from Daniel O’Day, Chairman & CEO, Gilead Sciences","Following the US FDA’s approval, Gilead will screen healthy volunteers for P-I study this week and plans to initiate the study in patients with COVID-19 in Aug’2020. The therapy could be given to patients via nebulizer, which would allow for easier dosing outside the hospital and in earlier stages of the disease
 The inhaled formulation will explore the use of Remdesivir in the earlier stages of COVID-19. The company will conduct a trial using IV infusion in outpatient settings such as infusion centers and nursing homes while the patients with a high risk of disease progression, it could be helpful to start treatment outside the hospital
 The company is also evaluating Remdesivir with other therapies while the company anticipates the manufacturing of the therapy by the end of 2020and many millions more by 2021","After receiving the green light from the FDA to move forward, Gilead is about to start trials of an inhaled version of remdesivir. We will screen healthy volunteers for Phase 1 trials this week and hope to begin studies in patients with COVID-19 in August. If the trials are successful, this could represent important progress. Remdesivir, our investigational antiviral medicine, is currently given to patients intravenously through daily infusions in the hospital. An inhaled formulation would be given through a nebulizer, which could potentially allow for easier administration outside the hospital, at earlier stages of disease. That could have significant implications in helping to stem the tide of the pandemic.

We have already learned a lot about how remdesivir works in a relatively short space of time. All of us at Gilead are grateful for the strong collaborations that helped to make this possible and to the thousands of patients who have taken part in clinical trials. Remdesivir is now being used to treat patients through emergency use authorizations and other access programs around the world. And yet, we still have some way to go in exploring the full potential of remdesivir to help against COVID-19.

As part of our next wave of clinical development, we will study remdesivir in treating earlier in the disease, in combination with other therapies and in additional patient groups.

So far, randomized controlled trials of remdesivir have been evaluating its safety and efficacy in hospitalized patients. In the NIAID study, remdesivir shortened recovery time by an average of four days and in the SIMPLE study of moderately ill patients (those in hospital but not requiring oxygen), individuals on a five-day course of remdesivir had better clinical outcomes than those receiving standard of care. The NIAID data also showed that treatment was most effective in patients who did not yet require medical ventilation, supporting further study in patients with earlier disease. The totality of these data shows that remdesivir has the potential to be of meaningful benefit to patients with COVID-19 and offers important hope. In our ongoing studies, we will work to deliver on that hope and potentially benefit more patients.

Next wave of studies
The inhaled formulation studies are one means of exploring the use of remdesivir in the earlier stages of COVID-19. We will also conduct trials using intravenous infusions in outpatient settings such as infusion centers and nursing homes. For patients who are at high risk of disease progression, it could be particularly beneficial to start treatment outside the hospital. Our hope is that earlier intervention could help patients avoid hospitalization altogether.

We are also exploring whether we can improve patient outcomes by combining remdesivir with other therapies.

Based on our knowledge of the disease so far, it seems that in the earlier stages of COVID-19, the virus itself is the primary driver of illness. In the later stages, the body’s inflammatory response may cause some of the most life-threatening aspects of the disease. It is important, therefore, to have tools that can work together to fight both aspects of the disease: an antiviral to target the virus itself and another therapy to tackle the inflammatory response. We have been keen to explore how remdesivir might work when combined with anti-inflammatory agents, particularly in the most severely ill patients.

Over the coming months we will see results from studies of remdesivir with two immune modulators. One study is looking at remdesivir with the JAK inhibitor, baricitinib, and a second is studying remdesivir in combination with the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab. Last week’s news on dexamethasone appears to further support the study of complementary approaches for treating COVID-19. Dexamethasone is a steroid that potentially reduces the body’s inflammatory response to the virus.

In addition to extending our focus to earlier treatment and combinations, our next wave of studies of remdesivir will include vulnerable patient populations. Last week, we announced that we are about to begin a clinical trial for children. The study will treat approximately 50 children, from newborns to adolescents who are hospitalized with COVID-19. We are also collaborating with an external group on a study in pregnant women, and we are planning a trial for patients with end-stage renal disease. Our continued aim in all our studies is to reflect the diverse demographics of the communities affected, including factors such as race, ethnicity and gender.

Our best hope of beating COVID-19 is with a set of tools at our disposal: complementary therapeutics, effective vaccines and widespread testing. Having already seen that science can deliver answers, we can be hopeful of continued progress. Gilead will do all it can to help drive that progress by exploring the full potential of remdesivir.

Increasing supply and ensuring access
As part of our aim to benefit as many patients as possible, we are focused on ensuring sufficient supplies of remdesivir and enabling access. We now expect to have more than two million remdesivir treatment courses manufactured by the end of the year and many millions more by 2021. Our scientists will stay focused on optimizing the manufacturing process, and we will continue to collaborate globally to ensure sufficient worldwide supply.

We donated our entire existing supplies of remdesivir through June. In keeping with Gilead’s longstanding commitment to access in the developing world, we have also set up voluntary licensing agreements with nine generic manufacturers. As we go forward, we will work to ensure that remdesivir is accessible and affordable to governments around the world. All of us at Gilead feel the full weight of our responsibility with remdesivir and this will continue to guide all our future actions.

Our ongoing commitment
Gilead has a long-term commitment to the study of emerging viruses, as part of our thirty-year presence in antivirals. In recent years, our scientists built up a library of compounds – one of which was remdesivir – that could potentially be used against future viruses.

Without years of research on remdesivir, we would not have been able to move so quickly in response to this outbreak. We were able to rapidly enter into clinical trials because we already had sufficient knowledge from studying remdesivir in other viruses to hope it might work against COVID-19. Research, iteration and perseverance have to be constant factors in scientific progress. The commitment has to be long-term.

Our commitment to remdesivir will continue now as we explore its full potential in the hope of helping many more patients with COVID-19. At the same time, our broader, ongoing research in emerging viruses continues. We are committed to doing everything we can to help with this pandemic, while ensuring we are prepared for the next.

About Remdesivir
Remdesivir is an antiviral product that is being studied in multiple ongoing international clinical trials. In recognition of the current public health emergency and based on available clinical data, the approval status of remdesivir varies by country. In countries where remdesivir has not been approved by the regional health authority, remdesivir is an investigational drug, and the safety and efficacy of remdesivir have not been established.

Remdesivir has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any use. In the U.S., the FDA granted remdesivir an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. This authorization is temporary and may be revoked, and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process. For information about the authorized use of remdesivir and mandatory requirements of the EUA in the U.S., please review the Fact Sheets and FDA Letter of Authorization available at www.gilead.com/remdesivir.

Forward-Looking Statement
This statement includes forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Remdesivir is an investigational drug that has not been approved by the FDA for any use, and its safety and efficacy has not been established for the treatment of COVID-19. There is the possibility of unfavorable results from ongoing and additional clinical trials involving remdesivir and the possibility that Gilead and other parties may be unable to initiate and complete one or more of such trials in the currently anticipated timelines or at all. Further, it is possible that Gilead may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of remdesivir or that FDA and other regulatory agencies may not approve remdesivir, and any marketing approvals, if granted, may have significant limitations on its use. As a result, remdesivir may never be successfully commercialized. In addition, Gilead may face challenges related to the allocation, geographical distribution and accessibility of existing and future supply of remdesivir. If Gilead is unable to sufficiently scale up manufacturing of remdesivir in the currently anticipated timelines, Gilead may be unable to meet global supply needs. There is also the risk that Gilead may be unable to recoup the significant expenses incurred to date and in the future related to the development and manufacturing of remdesivir. These risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those referred to in the forward-looking statements. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These and other risks are described in detail in Gilead’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gilead-3.jpg,COVID-19,Gilead,Remedesivir,COVID-19|2020|Against|August|Evaluating|Inhaled Version|Initiate|P-I|study,publish,23/6/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/an-open-letter-from-daniel-oday-chairman-ceo-gilead-sciences/,https://pharmashots.com/35374/gilead-to-initiate-p-i-study-evaluating-inhaled-version-of-remedesivir-against-covid-19-in-august-2020/

About mRNA Vaccines 
Vaccines work by mimicking disease agents to stimulate the immune system; building up a defense mechanism that remains active in the body to fight future infections. mRNA vaccines offer an innovative approach by delivering a nucleotide sequence encoding the antigen or antigens selected for their high potential to induce a protective immune response. mRNA vaccines also represent a potentially innovative alternative to conventional vaccine approaches for several reasons – their high potency, ability to initiate protein production without the need for nuclear entry, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration using non-viral delivery. This approach potentially enables the development of vaccines for disease areas where vaccination is not a viable option today. Additionally, a desired antigen or multiple antigens can be expressed from mRNA without the need to adjust the production process offering maximum flexibility and efficiency in development.

About the Sanofi Pasteur and Translate Bio collaboration
In 2018, Translate Bio entered into a collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Sanofi Pasteur Inc., the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, to develop mRNA vaccines for up to five infectious disease pathogens. This agreement was first expanded in March 2020 to include the collaborative development of a novel mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. This collaboration brings together Sanofi Pasteur’s leadership in vaccines and Translate Bio’s mRNA research and development expertise. Under the agreement, the companies are jointly conducting research and development activities to advance mRNA vaccines and mRNA vaccine platform development during a research term of at least four years after the original signing in 2018.

“The FDA acceptance of this application underscores our ongoing commitment to pursuing the full potential of BOTOX® to serve patients across a wide spectrum of diseases and clinical needs,” said Mitchell F. Brin, M.D., Senior Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer, BOTOX® & Neurotoxins, AbbVie. “Children living with neurogenic detrusor overactivity currently have limited options when they fail anticholinergic medications and prior to surgical intervention. If approved, BOTOX® will be the first neurotoxin treatment approved for use in treating detrusor overactivity in pediatric patients with an underlying neurologic condition who are not adequately managed by anticholinergic medications.”

Neurogenic detrusor overactivity results from the inability of the spinal cord and bladder to communicate effectively. As a result, the bladder muscle (detrusor) involuntarily contracts, increasing the pressure in the bladder and reducing the bladder capacity, which can cause the individual to leak urine frequently and unexpectedly. If not adequately managed with clean intermittent catheterization and anticholinergic drugs, this condition may require augmentation cystoplasty (an extensive surgical procedure in which the bladder is enlarged using a section of the patient’s intestine) to prevent renal damage.

There are a number of causes of neurogenic detrusor overactivity in children, such as transverse myelitis, spinal cord injury, and spina bifida, which is the most common and affects 1,500-2,000 of the more than 4 million babies born in the United States each year.1 More than 90% of those living with spina bifida experience urinary symptoms.2,3,4,5

“Over time, many pediatric patients with underlying neurologic conditions experience bladder and kidney damage, and treatment is critical,” said Paul F. Austin, M.D., FAAP, Chief of Pediatric Urology at Texas Children’s Hospital and Professor of Urology at Baylor College of Medicine. “Current treatment options often include anticholinergic medications, where long-term use needs to be considered carefully, in addition to surgery. The favorable BOTOX® clinical results for the treatment of pediatric patients with neurogenic detrusor activity are promising as we look to address unmet and ongoing needs in children and adolescents.”

BOTOX® is the first and only neurotoxin approved for the treatment of leakage of urine (incontinence) due to overactive bladder caused by a neurologic condition in adults who still have leakage or cannot tolerate the side effects after trying an anticholinergic medication. BOTOX® temporarily reduces muscle contractions by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscle, in this case, the bladder muscle, by selectively preventing the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.

About BOTOX®
BOTOX® is one of the most widely researched medications in the world, with a proven history as a therapeutic agent.6 First approved by the FDA in 1989 for two rare eye muscle disorders – blepharospasm and strabismus in adults, BOTOX® was the world’s first approved botulinum toxin type A treatment. Today, BOTOX® is FDA-approved for 11 therapeutic indications, including Chronic Migraine, overactive bladder, leakage of urine (incontinence) due to overactive bladder caused by a neurologic condition, cervical dystonia, spasticity, and severe underarm sweating (axillary hyperhidrosis). Backed by strong science and continuous innovation, BOTOX® proudly embraces its past while boldly looking to the future.

BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) Important Information

Indications
BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used:

To treat overactive bladder symptoms such as a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents (urge urinary incontinence), a strong need to urinate right away (urgency), and urinating often (frequency) in adults 18 years and older when another type of medicine (anticholinergic) does not work well enough or cannot be taken
To treat leakage of urine (incontinence) in adults 18 years and older with overactive bladder caused by a neurologic disease who still have leakage or cannot tolerate the side effects after trying an anticholinergic medication
To prevent headaches in adults with Chronic Migraine who have 15 or more days each month with headache lasting 4 or more hours each day in people 18 years or older
To treat increased muscle stiffness in elbow, wrist, finger, and thumb muscles in people 18 years and older with upper limb spasticity
To treat increased muscle stiffness in ankle and toe muscles in people 18 years and older with lower limb spasticity
To treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity
To treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy
To treat the abnormal head position and neck pain that happens with Cervical Dystonia (CD) in people 16 years and older
To treat certain types of eye muscle problems (Strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (Blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older
BOTOX® is also injected into the skin to treat the symptoms of severe underarm sweating (severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) when medicines used on the skin (topical) do not work well enough in people 18 years and older.

It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective to prevent headaches in patients with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days each month (episodic migraine).

It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective to treat increased stiffness in upper limb muscles other than those in the elbow, wrist, fingers, and thumb, or in lower limb muscles other than those in the ankle and toes in people 18 years and older. BOTOX® has not been shown to help people perform task-specific functions with their upper limbs or increase movement in joints that are permanently fixed in position by stiff muscles.

It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms or for severe sweating anywhere other than your armpits.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

BOTOX® may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX®:

Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months
Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing
There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat Chronic Migraine, severe underarm sweating, Blepharospasm, or Strabismus.

BOTOX® may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX®. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.

Do not receive BOTOX® if you: are allergic to any of the ingredients in BOTOX® (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.

Do not receive BOTOX® for the treatment of urinary incontinence if you: have a urinary tract infection (UTI) or cannot empty your bladder on your own and are not routinely catheterizing. Due to the risk of urinary retention (not being able to empty the bladder), only patients who are willing and able to initiate catheterization post treatment, if required, should be considered for treatment.

Patients treated for overactive bladder:
In clinical trials, 36 of the 552 patients had to self-catheterize for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX® compared to 2 of the 542 treated with placebo. The median duration of postinjection catheterization for these patients treated with BOTOX® 100 Units (n = 36) was 63 days (minimum 1 day to maximum 214 days) as compared to a median duration of 11 days (minimum 3 days to maximum 18 days) for patients receiving placebo (n = 2). Patients with diabetes mellitus treated with BOTOX® were more likely to develop urinary retention than nondiabetics.

Patients treated for overactive bladder due to neurologic disease:
In clinical trials, 30.6% of patients (33/108) who were not using clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) prior to injection, required catheterization for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX® 200 Units as compared to 6.7% of patients (7/104) treated with placebo. The median duration of postinjection catheterization for these patients treated with BOTOX® 200 Units (n = 33) was 289 days (minimum 1 day to maximum 530 days) as compared to a median duration of 358 days (minimum 2 days to maximum 379 days) for patients receiving placebo (n = 7). Among patients not using CIC at baseline, those with MS were more likely to require CIC post injection than those with SCI.

The dose of BOTOX® is not the same as, or comparable to, another botulinum toxin product.

Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® should be discontinued.

Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX®.

Tell your doctor if you have any breathing-related problems. Your doctor may monitor you for breathing problems during your treatment with BOTOX® for spasticity or for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. The risk of developing lung disease in patients with reduced lung function is increased in patients receiving BOTOX®.

Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their Blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.

Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their Strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.

Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. Bronchitis was reported more frequently in adults receiving BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity. Upper respiratory infections were also reported more frequently in adults with prior breathing related problems with spasticity. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were not reported more frequently than placebo.

Autonomic dysreflexia in patients treated for overactive bladder due to neurologic disease. Autonomic dysreflexia associated with intradetrusor injections of BOTOX® could occur in patients treated for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and may require prompt medical therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia was greater in patients treated with BOTOX® 200 Units compared with placebo (1.5% versus 0.4%, respectively).

Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; have symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and are being treated for urinary incontinence (symptoms of a urinary tract infection may include pain or burning with urination, frequent urination, or fever); have problems emptying your bladder on your own and are being treated for urinary incontinence; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX® can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX® passes into breast milk).

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX® with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you have received BOTOX® in the past.

Tell your doctor if you received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc®, Dysport®, or Xeomin® in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic by injection; take muscle relaxants; take an allergy or cold medicine; take a sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.

Other side effects of BOTOX® include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, dry eyes; drooping eyebrows; and upper respiratory tract infection. In people being treated for urinary incontinence other side effects include: urinary tract infection, painful urination, and/or inability to empty your bladder on your own. If you have difficulty fully emptying your bladder after receiving BOTOX®, you may need to use disposable self-catheters to empty your bladder up to a few times each day until your bladder is able to start emptying again.

For more information refer to the Medication Guide or talk with your doctor.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

35404,ATAI Launches IntroSpect Digital Therapeutics to Foster Mental Health Care,"ATAI launches IntroSpect Digital Therapeutics, appoints veteran software engineer David Keene as CEO","ATAI launches digital therapeutic platform IntroSpect Digital Therapeutics to transform mental health care and support companies working on new treatments for depression, anxiety, and addiction
 ATAI’s DTx initiative will integrate digital tools with concurrent clinical research into certain compounds on the company’s platform to magnify therapeutic impact, focusing on delivering personalized and scalable treatment
 The digital therapeutics allow clinicians to predict patients’ recovery pathways, by improving the understanding of biological phenotypes align with responses to certain interventions. The DTx system will cut down trial and error and shorten the time to therapeutic impact","LONDON and NEW YORK, June 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Today, ATAI Life Sciences (“ATAI” or the “Company”), a global biotech developing psychedelic and non-psychedelic compounds for various mental health indications, announced the launch of its digital therapeutic platform IntroSpect Digital Therapeutics, Inc. (“IntroSpect”). David Keene, who brings almost two decades of experience in tech- and healthcare-related fields, will serve as CEO and will be leading ATAI’s efforts to bring digital therapeutics (DTx) and precision psychiatry to bear on the mental health epidemic.

”The ubiquity of mental illness mandates that we leverage emerging technologies to improve our ability to support patients wherever they may be,” said Florian Brand, CEO of ATAI Life Sciences. “David’s unique experience will be indispensable to helping us treat the individual rather than the disease.”

Before coming to ATAI, Keene worked as a software engineer and served in leadership roles at a variety of online retail and gaming companies. After a life-changing cancer diagnosis, David felt compelled to found Everystory, which became Dthera Sciences in 2016. As Chief Technology Officer, David led the development of DTHR-ALZ, an artificial intelligence-enabled device for Alzheimer’s disease with text messaging and complex emotional recognition capabilities based on cameras and facial landmark data. The device was one of the first that the FDA granted Breakthrough Device Designation for Alzheimer’s and went from inception to production in just 18 months.

“Using the flexibility and power of digital technology allows us to be more capable than ever of meeting patients on their own terms.” said Keene. ”By using a variety of digital biomarkers, we stand to make treatments increasingly refined, effective, and – most importantly for mental healthcare – individualized.”

ATAI’s DTx initiative will also pair the development of digital tools or devices with concurrent clinical research into certain compounds on the company’s platform to enhance their therapeutic impact, with the goal of delivering personalized and scalable treatments to those who might not otherwise be able to access high quality care. Moreover, by following a modular approach to development, technologies developed for one indication or compound will be more easily repurposed for others being studied by the company.

“With improved understanding of how individual biological phenotypes align with responses to certain interventions, clinicians will be better able to predict patients’ recovery pathways,” said Srinivas Rao, Chief Scientific Officer of ATAI Life Sciences.

“This, in turn, will cut down trial and error and shorten the time to therapeutic impact. And for those with difficult to treat mental illnesses, time is absolutely critical.”

35417,BioInvent Reports the Enrollment of First Patient in P-I/IIa Study of BI-1206 + Keytruda for Solid Tumors,BioInvent enrolls first patient in Phase I/IIa trial of BI-1206 in combination with KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with solid tumors,"The focus of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability profile of the combination of BI-1206 with Keytruda, characterizing PK/PD profile and to determine the recommended dose of the combination regimen
 The study is divided into two parts into Part A, a dose escalation of BI-1206 in combination with the standard dose of Keytruda, and part B, which will explore the activity of the combination regimen in patients with advanced lung cancer, melanoma and other types of malignancies
 The study will be conducted at multiple sites across the US & EU and will assess its antitumoral activity, as well as explore the expression of potential immunological markers that might predict clinical responses. BI-1206 is a mAb targeting FcgRIIb, currently being evaluated in patients with NHL","Lund, Sweden – June 23, 2020 – BioInvent International AB (“BioInvent”) (OMXS: BINV), a biotech company focused on the discovery and development of novel and first-in-class immune-modulatory antibodies for cancer immunotherapy, today announces the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of BI-1206 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA®(pembrolizumab) for patients with solid tumors.

The objective of this trial is to explore the safety and tolerability profile of the combination of BI-1206 with KEYTRUDA, to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile and to determine the recommended dose of BI-1206 when combined with KEYTRUDA. It will be conducted in several sites across the US and Europe and will assess potential signs of antitumoral activity, as well as exploring the expression of potential immunological markers that might be associated, and eventually predict clinical responses.

The Phase I/IIa trial is divided into part A, a dose escalation of BI-1206 in combination with the standard dose of KEYTRUDA, and part B, which will explore the activity of the combination treatment in patients with advanced lung cancer, melanoma and other types of malignancies. Patients will be refractory to or have progressed on previous treatments with anti-PD1/PDL1 targeting agents.

BI-1206 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that exquisitely targets FcgRIIb, the only inhibitory Fcg receptor, “the brakes” of the innate immune system. It is currently also being investigated in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

Martin Welschof, CEO of BioInvent, said, “We are very excited to be starting this trial in collaboration with MSD. Based on a strong scientific rationale the trial will explore a potentially important mechanism of resistance to anti-PD1/PDL1 targeting agents. We believe BI-1206’s potential ability to increase and enhance the response rates to anti-PD1 targeting agents such as KEYTRUDA may be a powerful approach for the future treatment of a broad range of solid and liquid tumors.”

KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA (NYSE: MRK), with whom BioInvent has a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement for this study.

35426,Schrodinger Expands its Drug Discovery Efforts Against COVID-19 Deploying Parallel Computing on Google Cloud,Schrödinger Expands Discovery Efforts for COVID-19 Alliance with Advanced Molecular Simulation Leveraging High-Powered Parallel Computing on Google Cloud,"Schrodinger expands its work to discover novel antiviral therapies for COVID-19 as a part of a philanthropic global initiative. The accelerated pace includes the evaluation of billions of molecules/ week and is supported by Google Cloud which provides its high-powered parallel computing enabling the rapid exploration of chemical space
 Schrodinger has evaluated four different protein targets for the COVID-19 initiative and utilized Google Cloud to support ultra-large virtual screens for two targets
 In early 2020, the two companies collaborated, providing Schrodinger access to computing capacity equivalent to the world’s most powerful supercomputers to accelerate discovery for its commercial partners and its internal pipeline","NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Schrödinger (Nasdaq: SDGR), whose physics-based software platform enables discovery of high-quality, novel molecules for therapeutics and materials, today announced a significant expansion of its work to discover novel antiviral therapeutics for COVID-19 as a part of a philanthropic global initiative. The accelerated pace, including the evaluation of billions of molecules each week, is supported by Google Cloud, which has donated cloud credits for high-powered parallel computing to enable rapid exploration of chemical space.

Schrödinger is leading the computational design work in an alliance of major biopharma companies collaborating on the COVID-19 initiative, including Takeda, Novartis, Gilead Sciences, and WuXi AppTec. Schrödinger’s computational platform models the properties of molecules at the atomic level and identifies those most likely to succeed as therapeutics. To date, Schrödinger has evaluated four different protein targets for the COVID-19 initiative and utilized Google Cloud to support ultra-large virtual screens for two of the targets. The alliance partners will be responsible for acquiring and assaying the most promising compounds and advancing them to lead optimization with Schrödinger’s assistance.

Earlier this year, Schrödinger entered into a strategic agreement with Google Cloud that gave Schrödinger access to computing capacity equivalent to the world’s most powerful supercomputers to accelerate discovery for its commercial partners and its internal pipeline. The new grant from Google Cloud allows Schrödinger to deploy the same high-speed, parallel computing capability on the COVID-19 project, enabling rapid assessments of critical properties of billions of molecules per week through free-energy calculations and other physics-based applications.

The Google Cloud grant to the COVID-19 initiative amounts to 16 million hours of NVIDIA GPU time, which if used consecutively, would equate to 1,826 years of around-the-clock computing. GPU hours can be run in parallel on multiple NVIDIA processors, enabling the exploration of vast swaths of chemical space in a compressed time frame to speed the discovery portion of the R&D work.

“Google Cloud has been a great technology partner to us as we push the limits of computational modeling in our partnered and internal drug discovery programs to identify high-quality molecules more rapidly and at lower cost than traditional methods,” said Pat Lorton, Schrödinger’s Chief Technology Officer. “We’re delighted to be able to extend that bold approach to chemical exploration to the COVID-19 project, which is so important to global public health. Discovering high-quality novel molecules in silico requires extensive computing power, and Google Cloud’s GPU credits are crucial to that work.”

“We’re delighted to be teaming up again with Schrödinger and joining the rest of the COVID-19 alliance on this important project,” said Joe Corkery, Google Cloud’s Director of Product Management, Healthcare. “Like all the partners in this alliance, we understand the enormous public health challenge presented by COVID-19, and we’re proud to be contributing our compute power to accelerate the identification of new potential therapeutics in the fight against the virus.”

Virtual R&D Day investor event today from 3:00-5:30 pm CET / 9:00-11:30 am ET
PARIS – June 23, 2020 – Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Paul Hudson, Global Head of R&D John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., and members of the R&D and commercial leadership teams will provide an update on Sanofi’s approach to deliver potentially transformative medicines to patients.

This event is the fourth of a five-part series highlighting how Sanofi is leading with innovation. The previous three events focused on the Phase 2 results of Sanofi’s brain penetrant BTK inhibitor (‘168), Sanofi’s oncology pipeline progress, and future growth opportunities for Dupixent® (dupilumab)1.

“Since last December, we have been making tremendous progress on our ability to grow a pipeline of potentially transformative treatments through a unique, adaptive strategy that best positions Sanofi to deliver on our goal of bringing practice-changing medicines and vaccines to patients,” said Paul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. “While we have greatly accelerated our efforts across six priority development programs, the momentum we are seeing can be found across our entire pipeline. This is largely driven by how we are leveraging our innovative technology platforms and the deep insights we have gained into patients’ needs and disease pathways.”

Sanofi transforms R&D to drive productivity

Sanofi is transforming its R&D organization based on the pillars of the Company’s strategy announced at Capital Markets Day last December.

Focus on priorities by allocating R&D resources towards potential first-in-class or best-in-class medicines. Today, 75% of Sanofi’s assets in development have the potential to be either first- or best-in-class treatments
Lead with innovation Sanofi’s unique range of internal technologies such as multi-specific antibody, Nanobody®, and Synthorin platforms are delivering novel, cutting-edge drug discovery capabilities. Approximately 65% of Sanofi’s drug candidates in development are internally driven, including Sanofi’s investigational oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD ‘859) and its investigational anti-CEACAM5 (‘701) antibody drug conjugate
Accelerate efficiency by relentlessly improving clinical operations and embedding digital and real-world data capabilities, so Sanofi can move at greater speed. An example of this is Sanofi’s investigational brain penetrant BTK inhibitor ‘168 Phase 1 and 2 trials that were conducted one year faster than the industry average. Sanofi today shared that the first patient has been enrolled in the Phase 3 program despite the complexities of the current COVID-19 environment
Reinvent the way R&D performs by substantially simplifying the organization’s ways of working. This includes an integrated development organization, streamlined governance and greater team empowerment which has resulted in rapid initiation of clinical trials such as the studies evaluating Kevzara® (sarilumab)2 as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic
“Today we are highlighting the unique attributes of Sanofi R&D and the extremely encouraging progress our dedicated scientists and physicians have delivered these last six months, despite a very challenging context,” said John Reed, M.D. Ph.D., Global Head of Research & Development. “We have built industry-leading capabilities, including a broad toolbox of drug discovery platforms, that allow us to design molecules that give us new and potentially better ways to fight disease, while also focusing on enhancing our pace of delivery by creating a more agile organization.”

Synthorin platform adds to Sanofi’s diverse tools

The Synthorin platform, based on novel synthetic biology, is a unique platform that expands the genetic alphabet through the creation of a new DNA base pair. Addition of this new base pair to the two naturally occurring base pairs allows coding for a greater number of amino acids (up to 176 compared to 20 naturally occurring amino acids) resulting in substantially increased diversity of proteins, and gives scientists the potential to build a new generation of precision medicines for oncology and autoimmune disease.

One of the lead investigational product candidates, THOR-707, a “not-alpha” variant of interleukin-2, is in clinical development in multiple solid tumor types as both a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Early biomarker data from a Phase 1 study of THOR-707 showed that the molecule increased tumor-fighting CD8+ T and Natural Killer cells without significantly increasing regulatory T cells and eosinophils. Sanofi expects full Phase 1 results and the recommended Phase 2 dose by 2021. Additional precision interleukins will be entering the clinic between 2021-2023.

Venglustat builds on Sanofi’s rare diseases heritage combined with a deep understanding of disease pathways

Venglustat is an investigational oral glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor in development for several monogenetic diseases including rare diseases such as Gaucher disease type 3, Fabry disease, and GM-2 gangliosidoses, but also leveraging conserved glycosphingolipid disease biology in more monogenetic disorders, especially Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and GBA-Parkinson’s disease.

In rare diseases:

A Phase 2/3 study in Gaucher disease type 3 is ongoing
A Phase 3 trial in Tay-Sachs disease, a type of GM-2 gangliosidoses, was initiated at the beginning of this year
A Phase 3 trial in Fabry disease is expected to initiate in 2021
Regulatory filings for all three indications could be made during 2023 dependent upon positive data.

Beyond rare diseases:

Proof of concept data for GBA-Parkinson’s disease is expected by the first half of 2021.
Pivotal results for Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are expected by Q4 2021, and if positive, regulatory filings could begin in early 2022.
Fitusiran & BIVV001 use new modalities and cutting-edge protein engineering to potentially deliver differentiated solutions for patients suffering from hemophilia

Fitusiran is a potential best-in-class, investigational RNAi therapy for patients with hemophilia A and B (with or without inhibitors) aiming to rebalance the deficient coagulation cascade while significantly reducing the treatment burden with once-monthly subcutaneous dosing convenience. Fitusiran could potentially be the first ever product in hemophilia that does not require refrigeration. Positive data for fitusiran from interim analysis of the Phase 2 extension study in people with hemophilia A and B, with or without inhibitors were presented at the World Federation of Hemophilia Virtual Summit earlier this month. Two of three Phase 3 studies are fully enrolled with a near completion of the third. The pediatric Phase 3 study is currently enrolling. If data are positive, regulatory submission for fitusiran in adults and adolescents is planned in the second half of 2021.

BIVV0013 is a potential new class of factor VIII therapy for people with hemophilia A designed to extend protection from bleeds through high factor levels with once-weekly prophylactic dosing. Positive Phase 1 repeat dose study results were presented at the World Federation of Hemophilia Virtual Summit earlier this month. The Phase 3 study in previously treated hemophilia A patients started last year, and if data are positive, regulatory submissions could be made in the first half of 2022.

On the front lines in the fight against COVID-19

Since the beginning of the pandemic, Sanofi has played a leading role in the fight against COVID-19. In collaboration with global health authorities and leading partners, Sanofi is one of the only companies in the world to work on the search for COVID-19 vaccine candidates by exploring two complementary technological platforms. This approach increases the overall probability of success and strengthens Sanofi’s capabilities to prepare for potential future pandemics.

 · A recombinant protein-based​ vaccine approach (baculovirus), in collaboration with GSK. The recombinant protein vaccine candidate applies the same technology and established manufacturing capacity based on the baculovirus expression platform used for Sanofi’s influenza vaccine Flublok® while GSK is contributing its adjuvant AS03.

Sanofi expects a Phase 1/2 study to start in September and at the earliest, full approval by the first half of 2021. Sanofi has capacity to manufacture up to 1 billion doses a year.

· A messenger RNA (mRNA) candidate in collaboration with Translate Bio. With several exploratory vaccine platforms currently investigated across the industry, mRNA is considered among the most promising.

Sanofi expects a Phase 1 study to start by the end of the year, and, if data is positive, an approval at the earliest in the second half of 2021​. Translate Bio has established mRNA manufacturing capacity and Sanofi expects to be able to supply annual capacity of 90 to 360 million doses.

The R&D investor event will be held today from 3:00-5:30 pm CET / 9:00-11:30 am ET. The virtual set up of Sanofi’s R&D Day provides the opportunity to meet a wider group of the Company’s incredible leadership and strong scientific bench. Sanofi speakers include:

About Myeloid Tuning

Pionyr has developed a research approach called Myeloid Tuning, which is designed to rebalance the tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote anti-tumor immunity. Myeloid cells are a family of cell types that play an important role in both the activation and in the suppression of immune response to cancer. PY314 targets TREM2, a protein commonly found on the surface of a certain type of immunosuppressive, pro-tumor myeloid cells. PY314 is designed to selectively deplete these cells, resulting in a rebalancing of the tumor microenvironment that favors anti-tumor immunity. PY159 targets TREM1, a protein that is expressed on multiple immunosuppressive myeloid cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and myeloid derived suppressor cells. PY159 is designed to reprogram these immunosuppressive cells to instead stimulate a pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor immune response.

About Pionyr Immunotherapeutics

Pionyr is exploiting novel target discovery and antibody generation platform technologies to create the next generation of immuno-oncology therapeutics after checkpoint inhibitors. The company’s initial approach, termed “Myeloid Tuning,” is designed to enhance the immune system’s anti-tumor response by specifically altering the cellular infiltrate of the tumor microenvironment. Pionyr’s lead programs PY314 and PY159, targeting TREM2 and TREM1 respectively, are designed to selectively deplete and in some cases reprogram certain tumor-associated macrophages responsible for immunosuppression. Pionyr has raised $78 million from venture investors including New Enterprise Associates, OrbiMed, SV Health Investors, Sofinnova Ventures, Vida Ventures, Osage University Partners, Mission Bay Ventures, and Trinitas Ventures.

 The collaboration will leverage Codiak’s exosome engineering capabilities with Sarepta’s expertise in precision genetic medicine to develop next-generation therapeutics targeting the needs of patients with neuromuscular diseases","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in recision genetic medicine for rare diseases, and Codiak BioSciences, Inc., a company at the forefront of advancing engineered exosomes as a new class of biologic medicines, today announced a global research and option agreement to design and develop engineered exosome therapeutics to deliver gene therapy, gene editing and RNA technologies for euromuscular diseases. The engineered exosome approach offers the potential to effectively deliver genetic therapeutics without triggering the adaptive immune response.

The two-year agreement includes up to five neuromuscular targets. Codiak is eligible to receive up to $72.5 million in upfront and near-term license payments plus research funding. Sarepta is granted an option to any of the candidates developed pursuant to the research alliance.

Exosomes are natural nanoparticles that serve as the body’s intercellular communication system, facilitating the transfer of a wide variety molecular payloads between cells. As they are derived from human cells, exosomes provide a unique advantage as a targeted delivery system for genetic medicines because they are inherently non-immunogenic. Through its proprietary, engEx Platform, Codiak can engineer exosomes with specific cargos and guide tropism to cell types of interest. The collaboration will leverage Codiak’s exosome engineering capabilities with Sarepta’s expertise in precision genetic medicine to develop next generation therapeutics for patients with neuromuscular diseases that have few or no treatment options.

“As Sarepta expands its leadership position in precision genetic medicine, this alliance with Codiak furthers our goal to deliver the most advanced therapies to patients. Codiak’s engEx technology could potentially address some of the limitations of current treatment approaches and offers broad utility across Sarepta’s therapeutic modalities — gene therapies, gene editing and RNA. Codiak’s exosomes are engineered for precise tissue targeting and offer a non-viral delivery approach with non-immunogenic potential, thus opening up avenues for more efficient delivery and potential re-dosing,” said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive officer, Sarepta Therapeutics.

“The development of targeted delivery systems that enable repeat-dosing to select cell types has been a challenge for the emerging field of genetic medicine, especially in diseases of the muscle,” said Douglas E. Williams, President and CEO of Codiak BioSciences. “Engineered exosomes may offer a solution through their potential to selectively target muscle cells. We are excited to work with the world-class team at Sarepta to further build the engEx Platform and evaluate the potential of exosomes as next generation constructs incorporating gene therapy, gene editing and other nucleic acid payload modalities.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Sarepta has the exclusive option to license Codiak’s technology to develop and commercialize engineered exosome therapeutics for up to five neuromuscular targets. Sarepta and Codiak will collaborate to design exosomes that can deliver and functionally release select payloads, such as nucleic acids and gene therapy and gene editing constructs, in neuromuscular indications. If Sarepta elects to exercise its option on a target, Codiak will be responsible for research and preclinical development through IND preparation, and Sarepta will be responsible for clinical development and commercial activities. In addition to upfront, research funding and license payments, Codiak will be eligible to receive significant development and regulatory milestone payments and tiered royalties on future sales.

35495,The US FDA Launches Project Patient Voice to Share Patient-Reported Outcomes from Cancer Trials,FDA Announces First of Its Kind Pilot Program to Communicate Patient Reported Outcomes from Cancer Clinical Trials,"The US FDA has launched the new pilot program to share patient-reported symptoms during clinical cancer drug trials. Project Patient Voice is an initiative from the FDA’s Oncology Center for Excellence, featuring a public website, making the data available from patients taking part in cancer trials
 The companies conducting clinical trials will voluntarily share patient-reported symptoms. The website will include a list of cancer clinical trials along with PRO data. Each patient-reported symptom can be selected, exhibiting a series of bar/ pie charts describing the patient-reported symptom at baseline and over the first 6 mos. of treatment
 The Project Patient Voice pilot is a significant step in advancing a patient-centered approach to oncology drug development. AstraZeneca is the first company to PRO data for their approved therapy and has collaborated with the FDA to identify methods to display the information to HCPs and patients","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today launched Project Patient Voice, an initiative of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE). Through a new website, Project Patient Voice creates a consistent source of publicly available information describing patient-reported symptoms from cancer trials for marketed treatments. While this patient-reported data has historically been analyzed by the FDA during the drug approval process, it is rarely included in product labeling and, therefore, is largely inaccessible to the public.

“Project Patient Voice has been initiated by the Oncology Center of Excellence to give patients and health care professionals unique information on symptomatic side effects to better inform their treatment choices,” said FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. “The Project Patient Voice pilot is a significant step in advancing a patient-centered approach to oncology drug development. Where patient-reported symptom information is collected rigorously, this information should be readily available to patients.” 

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data is collected using questionnaires that patients complete during clinical trials. These questionnaires are designed to capture important information about disease- or treatment-related symptoms. This includes how severe or how often a symptom or side effect occurs.

Patient-reported data can provide additional, complementary information for health care professionals to discuss with patients, specifically when discussing the potential side effects of a particular cancer treatment. In contrast to the clinician-reported safety data in product labeling, the data in Project Patient Voice is obtained directly from patients and can show symptoms before treatment starts and at multiple time points while receiving cancer treatment.

The Project Patient Voice website will include a list of cancer clinical trials that have available patient-reported symptom data. Each trial will include a table of the patient-reported symptoms collected. Each patient-reported symptom can be selected to display a series of bar and pie charts describing the patient-reported symptom at baseline (before treatment starts) and over the first 6 months of treatment. This information provides insights into side effects not currently available in standard FDA safety tables, including existing symptoms before the start of treatment, symptoms over time, and the subset of patients who did not have a particular symptom prior to starting treatment.

In the first phase of this pilot website, only one trial will be included while the FDA seeks public feedback on how the information is presented. The FDA will use this feedback to consider improvements to the website in order to make the information as user-friendly as possible.
The visualizations and data included on the website are voluntarily provided by the drug companies that conducted the clinical trials. AstraZeneca is the first company to provide patient-reported outcome data for one of their FDA-approved drugs and has collaborated with the FDA to identify methods to display the information in a way that is informative to health care professionals and patients.

“There have long been calls to provide information to patients about how they may feel and function when receiving a cancer treatment. By initiating Project Patient Voice, we are moving towards standardized methods to display these outcomes, starting with patient-reported symptomatic adverse events,” said Paul Kluetz, M.D., deputy director of the FDA’s OCE. “We encourage sponsors to collect this data systematically and look forward to welcoming additional sponsor collaboration as we work to help further serve the patient community.”

Project Patient Voice is not meant to replace the clinician-reported safety information that is available as part of a drug’s labeling. Data from Project Patient Voice should not substitute for advice from a health care professional. Rather, Project Patient Voice serves as a complement to FDA patient labeling and patient information, not a sole source of information on which to make decisions about medical care.

The FDA will seek public feedback regarding the Project Patient Voice pilot effort at a virtual public workshop co-sponsored with the American Society of Clinical Oncology on July 17. The “Clinical Outcome Assessments in Cancer Clinical Trials” workshop will include health care providers, patients, health outcomes researchers, industry, advocacy groups and other stakeholders interested in rigorous measurement of symptom and functional outcomes. In addition to discussing trial design considerations to obtain patient-reported symptomatic side effects, the FDA will obtain feedback on the presentation of PRO symptomatic side effect data on the Project Patient Voice website to further ensure that the information is clear and meaningful to health care professionals and patients.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FDA.png,DigiHealth,0,0,Cancer Trials|FDA|Launches|Patient Reported Outcomes|Project Patient Voice|Share|US,publish,24/6/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/the-us-fda-launches-project-patient-voice-to-share-patient-reported-outcomes-from-cancer-trials/,https://pharmashots.com/35495/the-us-fda-launches-project-patient-voice-to-share-patient-reported-outcomes-from-cancer-trials/

 The focus of the study is to assess the effect of pamrevlumab on blood oxygenation in patients with COVID-19 with 1EPs as the proportion of hospitalized patients who have not received mechanical ventilation and ECMO and remain alive at day 28
 The company is expected to evaluate the longer-term efficacy and safety of pamrevlumab in patients who have recovered or are recovering from COVID-19 with evidence of interstitial lung disease in the second clinical study to be conducted in the US","SAN FRANCISCO, June 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — FibroGen, Inc. (NASDAQ: FGEN) today announced the initiation of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study investigating the efficacy and safety of pamrevlumab in hospitalized patients with acute coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This multicenter trial is being conducted in the U.S. and will enroll approximately 130 patients with COVID-19.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of pamrevlumab on blood oxygenation in patients with COVID-19 infection, and patients will be randomized to treatment with pamrevlumab or standard of care in a 1:1 ratio. The primary efficacy assessment is the proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who have not received mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and remain alive at Day 28.

“The majority of patients with severe forms of COVID-19 have bilateral interstitial pneumonia, causing reduction in oxygenation and severe respiratory failure,” said Elias Kouchakji, M.D., Senior Vice President, Clinical Development, Drug Safety, and Pharmacovigilance, FibroGen. “The administration of pamrevlumab, a first-in-class anti-connective growth factor monoclonal antibody, could protect the lung from the immediate consequences of the infection presented as acute respiratory distress syndrome.”

A second planned U.S. trial is expected to assess the longer term efficacy and safety of pamrevlumab in patients who have recovered or are recovering from COVID-19 infection with evidence of interstitial lung disease.

Pamrevlumab is a first-in-class antibody developed by FibroGen to inhibit the activity of CTGF, a common factor in fibrotic and proliferative disorders characterized by persistent and excessive scarring that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. This trial will assess pamrevlumab’s effect on patient time to and on ventilatory support, currently the most urgent need, and its potential to reduce mortality and fibrotic sequelae in the lung.

“Given our expertise in CTGF biology and the potential application of this unique approach to the treatment of patients with acute COVID-19 infection, we are excited to begin enrolling this trial in the U.S.” said Enrique Conterno, Chief Executive Officer, FibroGen. “We are grateful for the collaboration of the FDA, investigators, and patients in enabling the conduct of this trial.”

 uniQure will be responsible for the completion of the P-III HOPE-B study and scale-up manufacture for early commercial supply under an agreed plan with CSL Behring. uniQure will lead clinical development and regulatory activities, reimbursed by CSL Behring
 The collaboration will foster CSL Behring’s gene therapy portfolio while allowing uniQure to expand and accelerate pipeline and platform. The AMT-061 consists of an AAV5 viral vector carrying a gene cassette with FIX-Padua, currently being evaluated in P-III study and could be one of the first gene therapies to provide long-term benefits to patients with hemophilia B","KING of PRUSSIA, Pa.

• Unique gene therapy has the potential to be one of the first to market treatments to provide potentially long-term benefits with only one dose
• CSL Behring builds on legacy of delivering innovative treatment options for people with Hemophilia B

24 Jun 2020
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., – 24 June 2020 – Global biotherapeutics leader CSL Behring announced today that it has agreed to acquire exclusive global license rights to commercialize an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy program, AMT-061 (etranacogene dezaparvovec), for the treatment of hemophilia B from uniQure (NASDAQ: QURE), a leading gene therapy company. The AMT-061 program, currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, could be one of the first gene therapies to provide potentially long-term benefits to patients with hemophilia B.

One dose of AMT-061 has shown to increase Factor IX (FIX) plasma levels – the blood clotting protein lacking in people with hemophilia B – to a degree that reduces or eliminates the tendency for bleeding for many years. Should AMT-061 be successful, appropriate candidate hemophilia B patients would be able to have a one-time treatment to restore FIX activity to functional levels capable of eliminating the need for frequent and ongoing replacement therapies.

“Our vision with hemophilia B patients is to offer transformational treatment paradigms that help free them from the lifelong burden of this disease,” said CSL’s CEO and Managing Director Paul Perreault. “With more than three decades of providing lifesaving innovations for the global bleeding disorders community, we are well positioned to maximize the potential benefit of this therapy.”

Under the agreement with uniQure, upon closing the transaction CSL Behring will have the exclusive global right to commercialize AMT-061. uniQure will receive an upfront cash payment of US$450 million followed by regulatory and commercial sales milestone payments and royalties. Under the terms of the agreement, uniQure will complete the Phase 3 trial and scale up manufacture for early commercial supply under an agreed plan with CSL Behring. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory clearances before closing.

“We are thrilled to enter into this commercialization and license agreement with CSL Behring, an ideal commercial partner with global reach and decades of expertise in hemophilia,” stated Matt Kapusta, chief executive officer of uniQure. “We believe that through this arrangement, we are ideally positioned to deliver our innovative gene therapy to the largest number of hemophilia B patients as quickly as possible. The transaction represents a major milestone in the development of etranacogene dezaparvovec and, when closed, we expect that it will provide uniQure with significant financial resources to advance and expand our pipeline of gene therapy candidates, anchored by AMT-130 in Huntington’s disease, as well as to invest further in our leading manufacturing and technology platform.”

In December 2019, uniQure announced that data from its Phase 2b dose-confirmation study of AMT-061 showed that all patients stabilized and sustained FIX activity at functionally high levels one year after a single dose – with increases in FIX activity of up to 50% of normal and a mean of 41%. This exceeds the levels considered sufficient to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk of bleeding events.

According to CSL Behring’s Executive Vice President, Head of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer Bill Mezzanotte, “We are exceedingly encouraged by the data we’ve seen on AMT-061. Not only has the treatment option demonstrated robust clinically meaningful responses in FIX activity, but it has also exhibited excellent safety over multiple years of observation. Expanding our gene therapy portfolio to treat hemophilia B, a disease state well known to CSL Behring, exemplifies how we are strategically aligning our rare and serious disease focus and our targeted therapeutic area focus with our core scientific platforms to transform the lives of patients.”

This acquisition will also enhance CSL Behring’s capabilities in its growing gene therapy portfolio. The company is currently developing a stem cell gene therapy (CSL200) for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has recently established an alliance with Seattle Children’s Research Institute to develop a stem cell gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency diseases — another rare disease area where CSL Behring has leading capabilities.

Perreault added, “Upon approval, this next-generation therapy will be highly complementary to our existing best-in-class hemophilia B product portfolio with an alternate best-in-class treatment option. With the license to AMT-061, we are building on our legacy of delivering lifesaving innovations in hematology where, today, we offer a market leading product for hemophilia B and we are a leader in therapies for treating hemophilia A, von Willebrand disease, thrombosis, and other life-threatening conditions.”

CSL Behring has put patients first by addressing the world’s most serious, complicated and rare diseases for over 100 years. The company is now bringing that same commitment to gene therapy; its mission is to address unmet patient needs and enable patients to get the very most out of life.

About Etranacogene Dezaparvovec (AMT-061)

Etranacogene dezaparvovec, also known as AMT-061, consists of an AAV5 viral vector carrying a gene cassette with the patent-protected Padua variant of Factor IX (FIX-Padua). AAV5-based gene therapies have been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in many clinical trials, including four uniQure trials conducted in 25 patients in hemophilia B and other indications. No patient treated in clinical trials with uniQure’s AAV5-based gene therapies has experienced any cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response to the capsid. Additionally, preclinical and clinical data show that AAV5-based gene therapies may be clinically effective in patients with pre-existing antibodies to AAV5, thereby potentially increasing patient eligibility for treatment compared to other gene therapy product candidates.

35539,AstraZeneca Reports Results of Breztri Aerosphere in P-III ETHOS Study to Treat COPD,Breztri Aerosphere significantly reduced rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations in Phase III ETHOS trial,"The P-III ETHOS study involves assessing of Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) vs dual therapies [Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) and PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate)] in 8,500+ patients with mod. to sev. COPD and a history of exacerbation(s) in the previous year, receiving at least two inhaled maintenance treatments at entry into the study
 Results: 24% reduction in exacerbations; 46% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality when compared with Bevespi Aerosphere, showed a 13% reduction in exacerbations compared with PT009. Additionally, demonstrated a reduction in the rate of mod. or sev. exacerbations at the half dose of budesonide
 Breztri Aerosphere is an approved therapy in Japan and China for patients with COPD and is under regulatory review in the US and EU. As per the agreement to acquire Pearl Therapeutics, AstraZeneca will pay $150M as milestone upon US approval of the therapy for COPD","Trial results published in New England Journal of Medicine
Full results from the positive Phase III ETHOS trial showed AstraZeneca’s triple-combination therapy Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with two dual-combination therapies in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).1

Compared with Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate), Breztri Aerosphere achieved a 24% reduction (p<0.001) in exacerbations. Breztri Aerosphere achieved a 13% reduction (p=0.003) compared with PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate). The dual-combination therapies used as comparators in the trial represent recommended therapeutic classes for the treatment of COPD.2

In a key secondary endpoint, Breztri Aerosphere showed a 46% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality compared with Bevespi Aerosphere (unadjusted p=0.01).3

The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine1 and simultaneously presented at the American Thoracic Society virtual Scientific Symposium, Clinical Trial Results in Pulmonary Medicine.3 AstraZeneca will continue to review these data with health authorities.

Klaus Rabe, Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at the University of Kiel, Director of the Department of Pneumology at Clinic Grosshansdorf, Germany, and Lead Investigator of the ETHOS trial, said: “The Phase III ETHOS trial results are important and demonstrate the benefit of Breztri Aerosphere in reducing the rate of exacerbations in this progressive disease. The findings also show that reducing risk of all-cause mortality is achievable and could transform treatment goals in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the third leading cause of death worldwide and exacerbations can contribute to an increase in mortality in these patients. The results of the Phase III ETHOS trial support the strong clinical profile of Breztri Aerosphere in reducing exacerbation rates compared with dual-combination therapies. We are excited to have the data on all-cause mortality, which is a key consideration for COPD management.”

The safety and tolerability of Breztri Aerosphere were consistent with the known profiles of the dual comparators. In the trial, the most frequently reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, COPD and upper respiratory tract infection. The incidence of confirmed pneumonia was 4.2% with Breztri Aerosphere, 2.3% with Bevespi Aerosphere and 4.5% with PT009.

These results are based on Breztri Aerosphere at the standard dose of budesonide (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate 320/14.4/9.6mcg), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). In the trial, Breztri Aerosphere at half the dose of budesonide (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate 160/14.4/9.6mcg) also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate 14.4/9.6mcg) and PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate 320/9.6mcg).1

Breztri Aerosphere is approved in Japan and China for patients with COPD. It is under regulatory review in the US and EU.

COPD

COPD is a progressive disease which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness.2 It affects an estimated 384 million people4 and is the third leading cause of death globally.5 Improving lung function, reducing exacerbations and managing daily symptoms such as breathlessness are important treatment goals in the management of COPD.2 Even a single COPD exacerbation may be associated with a significant increase in the rate of decline in lung function,6 a significant deterioration in quality of life,7 and can significantly reduce life expectancy and increase the risk of mortality.8,9

ETHOS and the ATHENA clinical trial programme

ETHOS is a randomised, double-blinded, multi-centre, parallel-group, 52-week trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Breztri Aerosphere in symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbation(s) in the previous year. Outcomes in the ETHOS trial included, as a primary endpoint, the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations.

Bevespi Aerosphere is a fixed-dose dual bronchodilator in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI), combining glycopyrronium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA). PT009 is a single inhaler, fixed-dose dual-combination therapy of budesonide, an ICS, and formoterol fumarate, a LABA. It was developed as a relevant comparator in clinical trials for Breztri Aerosphere.

ETHOS involved more than 8,500 patients who had experienced ≥1 moderate/severe exacerbation in the previous year and were receiving at least two inhaled maintenance treatments at entry into the trial.

ETHOS is part of AstraZeneca’s ATHENA Phase III clinical trial programme for Breztri Aerosphere, which included more than 15,500 patients globally across 11 trials. The results of the earlier pivotal Phase III KRONOS trial were published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine.10

ETHOS primary and key secondary endpoints

 
Breztri Aerosphere

Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) is a single-inhaler, fixed dose triple-combination of budesonide, an ICS, with glycopyrronium, a LAMA, and formoterol fumarate, a LABA.

Under the terms of the agreement to acquire Pearl Therapeutics Inc., AstraZeneca anticipates making a $150m milestone payment upon US regulatory approval of Breztri Aerosphere for COPD. This payment would be the final development and regulatory milestone under that agreement.

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) that is not curable by surgery or radiation. This approval is based on data from the Phase 2 KEYNOTE-629 trial, in which KEYTRUDA demonstrated meaningful efficacy and durability of response, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 34% (95% CI, 25-44), including a complete response rate of 4% and a partial response rate of 31%. Among responding patients, 69% had ongoing responses of six months or longer. After a median follow-up time of 9.5 months, the median duration of response (DOR) had not been reached (range, 2.7 to 13.1+ months).

“Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common form of skin cancer,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “In KEYNOTE-629, treatment with KEYTRUDA resulted in clinically meaningful and durable responses. Today’s approval is great news for patients with cSCC and further demonstrates our commitment to bringing new treatment options to patients with advanced, difficult-to-treat cancers.”

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.

Data Supporting Approval

The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in patients with recurrent or metastatic cSCC enrolled in KEYNOTE-629 (NCT03284424), a multi-center, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label trial. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DOR as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ.

Among the 105 patients treated, 87% received one or more prior lines of therapy and 74% received prior radiation therapy. Forty-five percent of patients had locally recurrent only cSCC, 24% had metastatic only cSCC and 31% had both locally recurrent and metastatic cSCC. The study population characteristics were: median age of 72 years (range, 29 to 95); 71% age 65 or older; 76% male; 71% White; 25% race unknown; 34% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 and 66% ECOG PS of 1.

KEYTRUDA demonstrated an ORR of 34% (95% CI, 25-44) with a complete response rate of 4% and a partial response rate of 31%. Among the 36 responding patients, 69% had ongoing responses of six months or longer. After a median follow-up time of 9.5 months, the median DOR had not been reached (range, 2.7 to 13.1+ months).

Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or a maximum of 24 months. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of KEYTRUDA during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Assessment of tumor status was performed every six weeks during the first year and every nine weeks during the second year.

Among the 105 patients with cSCC enrolled in KEYNOTE-629, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 5.8 months (range, 1 day to 16.1 months). Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications were ineligible. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with cSCC were similar to those occurring in 2,799 patients with melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with KEYTRUDA as a single agent. Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) that occurred at a higher incidence included lymphopenia (11%).

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions

Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Adverse Reactions

In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (28%), diarrhea (26%), rash (24%), and nausea (21%).

35560,Fulcrum Initiates P-III LOSVID Study Evaluating Losmapimod for Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19,Fulcrum Therapeutics Announces Initiation of Multi-Center Phase 3 (LOSVID) Trial with Losmapimod for Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,"The P-III LOSVID study assess the safety and efficacy of losmapimod (15mg, bid) vs PBO for 14 days on top of SOC in ~400 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and at risk of progression to critical illness based on older age and elevated systemic inflammation
 The 1EPs of the study is the proportion of patients who progress to death or respiratory failure by day 28 while 2EPs include clinical status on days 7 & 14 as measured on the nine-point WHO ordinal scale of COVID-19 severity, the total number of study days free of oxygen supplementation, all-cause mortality, length of hospitalization/ ICU stay, AEs and viral clearance
 The company plans to conduct an interim analysis for futility and sample size re-estimation by an independent data monitoring committee when ~50% of subjects complete the 28-day visit with its anticipated results in Q1’21. Losmapimod is an orally available selective p38α/β MAPK inhibitor","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: FULC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of patients with genetically defined rare diseases, today announced that it received early notification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that the company may proceed with initiating a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of losmapimod in higher risk hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Losmapimod is an orally available selective p38α/β mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor.

The LOSVID trial is a Phase 3, international, multicenter trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a 15 mg twice per day oral dose of losmapimod compared to placebo for 14 days on top of standard of care in approximately 400 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and at risk of progression to critical illness based on older age and elevated systemic inflammation. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who progress to death or respiratory failure by day 28. Additional secondary endpoints include clinical status on days seven and 14 as measured on the nine point WHO ordinal scale of COVID-19 severity, total number of study days free of oxygen supplementation, all-cause mortality, length of hospitalization and ICU stay, adverse events and viral clearance.

An interim analysis will be conducted in the fourth quarter of 2020 for futility and sample size re-estimation by an independent data monitoring committee when approximately 50 percent of subjects complete the 28-day visit. Topline data is expected to be reported in the first quarter of 2021.

“We believe that losmapimod has the potential to be a differentiated treatment option in the global fight against COVID-19,” said Robert J. Gould, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer. “The speed with which we have advanced this program reflects our deep understanding of the mechanism of action of losmapimod, the pressing need for treatment options and the commitment of our team to develop therapies that result in meaningful outcomes for patients. We are encouraged by the feedback we have received from investigators, and we expect to have all sites participating in the trial to be activated in the coming weeks.”

“We look forward to conducting this important trial in parallel with our ongoing clinical program for losmapimod as a potential treatment of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD),” continued Dr. Gould. “We have several anticipated upcoming data readouts in the next six to 12 months from both the COVID-19 and FSHD trials and we look forward to the outcomes of these trials which will tell us more about losmapimod’s impact in both these patient populations. Additionally, we continue our progress with FTX-6058 towards the clinic for the potential treatment of sickle cell disease.”

Based on its mechanism of action and preclinical and clinical studies, Fulcrum believes that inhibiting the p38 MAPK pathway with losmapimod has the potential to treat COVID-19 by reducing the acute exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and restoring the antigen-specific immune responses needed for viral clearance potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes.

“Studies in elderly people indicating that p38 inhibition can decrease inflammatory responses but enhance T-cell responses to a viral antigen suggest that losmapimod could ameliorate the pathology of COVID-19 in multiple ways,” said Robert Finberg, MD, Professor of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School. “Losmapimod is a promising treatment candidate that could address multiple key contributors to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and already has an extensive amount of safety and tolerability data across multiple age groups, including the elderly. The rapid initiation of this pivotal trial reflects the data supporting this research and the pressing need for effective therapies that reduce the morbidity associated with COVID-19.”

The Potential Role of p38 Inhibition in the Treatment of COVID-19
p38 MAPK is well known as an important mediator of acute response to stress, including acute inflammation. Multiple preclinical and clinical studies have shown that activation of the p38 MAPK significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of coronavirus infections including COVID-19. In two clinical studies reported in the literature, an oral dose of 15 mg twice per day of losmapimod in older individuals decreased inflammatory responses and enhanced normal immune responses. Additionally, in prior human clinical trials predominantly in chronic inflammatory conditions, losmapimod had an immediate effect on a number of inflammatory biomarkers that have been associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). p38 inhibition has also been demonstrated to reduce Ang II-induced endothelial and organ damage in several experimental models and may address the renin-angiotensin system imbalance that is believed to contribute to key morbidities in COVID-19 patients.

About Losmapimod
Losmapimod is a selective p38α/β mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor that was exclusively in-licensed from GSK by Fulcrum Therapeutics following Fulcrum’s discovery of the role of p38α/β inhibitors in the reduction of DUX4 expression and an extensive review of known compounds. Utilizing its internal product engine, Fulcrum discovered that inhibition of p38α/β reduced expression of the DUX4 gene in muscle cells derived from patients with FSHD. Researchers at Fulcrum believe that losmapimod has the potential to treat COVID-19 by reducing the acute exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and restoring the antigen-specific immune responses needed for viral clearance, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes. Losmapimod has been evaluated in more than 3,600 subjects in prior clinical research across multiple other indications, including in several Phase 2 trials and a large Phase 3 trial in acute myocardial infarction. No safety signals were attributed to losmapimod in any of these trials. Fulcrum is currently conducting Phase 2 trials investigating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of losmapimod to treat the root cause of FSHD and initiating a Phase 3 trial investigating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of losmapimod to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

About Fulcrum Therapeutics
Fulcrum Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of patients with genetically defined rare diseases in areas of high unmet medical need. Fulcrum’s proprietary product engine identifies drug targets which can modulate gene expression to treat the known root cause of gene mis-expression.

35578,Theravance Reports First Patient Dosing in a P-II Study of TD-0903 for Hospitalized Patients with Acute Lung Injury Associated with COVID-19,Theravance Biopharma Announces First Patient Dosed in Phase 2 Study of TD-0903 for the Treatment of Hospitalized Patients with Acute Lung Injury Caused by COVID-19,"The first patient has been dosed in a P-II study of TD-0903. The P-II study consists of two parts: the first part will assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical response to treatment in sequential ascending dose cohorts of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with each patient demonstrating hypoxia being dosed for 7 days
 The second part will be conducted at hospital-based clinical sites in the UK, EU & the US, pending appropriate Ethics Committee, and regulatory approvals in territories. The P-II study in the UK follows the completion of dosing in the P-I study in healthy volunteers
 TD-0903 is a lung-selective, nebulized pan-JAK inhibitor, being developed to treat hospitalized patients with ALI caused by COVID-19","LIN and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., June 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: TBPH) (“Theravance Biopharma” or the “Company”), a diversified biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of organ-selective medicines, today announced that the first COVID-19 patient has been dosed in a Phase 2 study of TD-0903. TD-0903 is a lung-selective, nebulized Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) in development for the potential treatment of hospitalized patients with Acute Lung Injury (ALI) caused by COVID-19. The Company believes TD-0903 has the potential to inhibit the cytokine storm associated with ALI and prevent progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

The initiation of the Phase 2 study in patients in the United Kingdom (UK) follows the successful completion of dosing in the Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers at the same clinical unit in the UK, allowing for a rapid transition to Phase 2.

The Phase 2 study consists of two parts. The first part will assess the safety, tolerability and clinical response to treatment in sequential ascending dose cohorts of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with each patient being dosed for 7 days. Patients will be enrolled if they demonstrate hypoxia (lack of oxygen in the blood) as that is believed to be a marker of underlying hyperinflammation (cytokine storm) in the lung. More information can be found on clinicaltrials.gov, identifier number: NCT04402866. The second part will be a larger, multi-center study conducted at hospital-based clinical sites in the UK, as well as other European countries and in the United States, pending appropriate Ethics Committee and regulatory approvals in those territories.

“A subgroup of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 develops Acute Lung Injury due to a dysfunctional immune response to the virus within the lungs resulting in hypoxia which then requires hospitalization, supplemental oxygen and in some cases even mechanical ventilation in the ICU if patients develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Delivery of a JAK inhibitor directly to the lung could be an important intervention to treat this hyperinflammation and to prevent patients from deteriorating to the point where they need assisted ventilation or ICU admission,” said Professor Ashley Woodcock, Chairman of the Medicines Evaluation Unit (MEU) conducting the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Professor of Respiratory Medicine, University of Manchester and Consultant Physician, NW Lung Centre, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust.i “We are pleased to be leading the clinical trial on behalf of Theravance Biopharma to efficiently evaluate the safety and efficacy of TD-0903 in this patient population to inform its potential role in the fight against COVID-19.”

“Working with the Medicines Evaluation Unit over the past few months has once again been an outstanding experience as we mobilized our response to COVID-19. The initiation of the Phase 2 study of TD-0903 is a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to apply our organ-selective therapies and expertise to treat inflammatory conditions,” said Rick E Winningham, Chief Executive Officer at Theravance Biopharma. “Theravance Biopharma has a long history of developing lung-selective medicines to treat respiratory disease, and we are proud to leverage this experience and expertise to respond to the current pandemic.”

About TD-0903

JAK inhibitors function by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. Inhibiting these JAK enzymes interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Limiting JAK inhibition to the lung is expected to improve the therapeutic index relative to systemic inhibition. Thus, inhaled JAK inhibitors with lung-restricted exposure are of high interest as potential treatments for respiratory illness.

TD-0903 is a lung-selective, nebulized pan-JAK inhibitor that was discovered and developed at Theravance Biopharma. TD-0903 has been shown in experimental murine models to have potent, broad inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling in the airways following challenges with multiple cytokines. By its mechanism, TD-0903 has the potential to block the release of cytokines and chemokines that may be associated with Acute Lung Injury and the initiation of a cytokine storm syndrome. Preclinical studies suggest that TD-0903 has a very high lung:plasma ratio and rapid metabolic clearance resulting in low systemic exposure, compatible with its lung selectivity. TD-0903 is administered via a nebulized inhalation solution, which further enhances its lung selectivity. Preclinical pharmacodynamic studies indicate that TD-0903 has an extended duration of action that should enable once or twice daily dosing in humans.

As disclosed initially at Theravance Biopharma’s December 2018 Research and Development Day, the Company indicated the initial clinical application of TD-0903 would be to explore its utility in preventing/delaying graft rejection among individuals receiving lung transplantation. Although this is still a potential clinical application for TD-0903, in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has prioritized activities toward assessing the potential for TD-0903 to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients who become short of breath and whose blood oxygen levels begin to drop. These patients are at increased risk of respiratory complications including ALI and ARDS. They may also require prolonged hospitalization, continuous oxygen and, in the most severe cases, admission to ICU to assist their breathing with non-invasive and/or mechanical ventilation. Treatment with JAK inhibition is recognized as an important anti-inflammatory mechanism to potentially reduce the hyperinflammation seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who develop ALI and ARDS.ii

Zogenix to host an investor call tomorrow, June 26, at 8:30 AM ET / 5:30 AM PT
EMERYVILLE, Calif., June 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Zogenix, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZGNX), a global pharmaceutical company developing rare disease therapies, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution, CIV for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older. FINTEPLA will be launched through a restricted distribution program, called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program, and is expected to be available through Zogenix’s specialty pharmacy partner by the end of July.

“The approval of FINTEPLA by the FDA is a significant milestone we are proud to celebrate with the patients and families living with Dravet syndrome,” said Stephen J. Farr, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Zogenix. “We began this global development program nearly six years ago after researchers in Belgium recognized the potential of fenfluramine, a drug with distinct pharmacology from all other anticonvulsant agents, to treat intractable seizures in Dravet syndrome. Our heartfelt gratitude goes to the patients, families, and everyone who supported the rigorous development program that led to FINTEPLA’s approval.”

Dravet syndrome is a rare childhood-onset epilepsy marked by frequent and severe treatment-resistant seizures, associated hospitalizations and medical emergencies, significant developmental and motor impairments, and an increased risk of sudden unexpected death (SUDEP).

“There remains a huge unmet need for the many Dravet syndrome patients who continue to experience frequent severe seizures even while taking one or more of the currently available anti-seizure medications,” said Joseph Sullivan, M.D., Director of the Pediatric Epilepsy Center of Excellence at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals and the Principal Investigator for FINTEPLA in Dravet syndrome. “Given the profound reductions in convulsive seizure frequency seen in the FINTEPLA clinical trials, combined with the ongoing, robust safety monitoring that will be part of its use, I feel FINTEPLA will offer an extremely important treatment option for Dravet syndrome patients.”

The FDA’s approval of FINTEPLA in Dravet syndrome was based on data from two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials, published in The Lancet1 and JAMA Neurology2, and safety data from an open-label extension trial in which many patients received FINTEPLA for up to three years. When added to existing treatment regimens, FINTEPLA significantly reduced the monthly convulsive seizure frequency compared to placebo in study patients whose seizures were not adequately controlled on one or more antiepileptic drugs. In addition, most study patients responded to treatment with FINTEPLA within three to four weeks and effects remained consistent over the treatment period.

The most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence, sedation, lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue, malaise, asthenia; ataxia, balance disorder, gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling, salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.

FINTEPLA will be available to certified prescribers in the U.S. in July. Zogenix is launching Zogenix Central™, a comprehensive support service that will provide ongoing product assistance to patients, caregivers, and their medical teams. Further information is available at www.FINTEPLA.com to assist patients and their families.

“Having a new FDA-approved treatment option is so important because it improves our ability to optimize each patient’s treatment,” said Mary Anne Meskis, Executive Director of the Dravet Syndrome Foundation. “Moreover, because families living with Dravet syndrome never know when the next seizure is going to occur, whether they will end up in the E.R., or what the consequences might be following the seizure, having a strong support program like Zogenix Central to reduce the strain on families is very welcome. This will allow family members to remain focused on providing the best care of their loved one with Dravet.”

About Dravet Syndrome
Dravet syndrome is a rare childhood-onset epilepsy marked by frequent debilitating seizures, lifelong developmental and motor impairments, and an increased risk of sudden death. Despite existing therapies, there remains a great unmet need in Dravet syndrome to reduce convulsive seizures that can lead to medical emergencies, hospitalizations, and SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy). The severity and unpredictability of the disease, coupled with around-the-clock concern for the diagnosed child’s well-being, can present significant emotional and logistical challenges for all members of the family.

About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution, CIV
FINTEPLA is an approved treatment, in the U.S., for seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older. Across multiple clinical studies, FINTEPLA demonstrated significant and sustained reduction of convulsive seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. In two pivotal Phase 3 trials, the reduction in convulsive seizure frequency per 28 days was statistically significantly greater for all dose groups of FINTEPLA compared to placebo.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Boxed WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION

There is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5‑HT2B receptor agonist activity, including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA), and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Echocardiogram assessments are required before, during, and after treatment with FINTEPLA.
FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.
Contraindications

FINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with Hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use of, or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Valvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see boxed Warning)

Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5‑HT2B receptor agonist activity, including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA), and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment, during treatment, and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of this condition. In clinical trials of up to 3 years in duration, no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Monitoring
Prior to starting treatment, patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months, and once 3-6 months post-treatment with FINTEPLA.

If valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension is observed on an echocardiogram, the prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA.

FINTEPLA REMS Program (see boxed Warning)

FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS program. Prescribers must Counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment, and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the REMS program and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the REMS program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.

Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight

FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Most patients resumed the expected measured increases in weight by the end of the open-label extension study. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.

Somnolence, Sedation, and Lethargy

FINTEPLA can cause somnolence, sedation, and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs

As with most AEDs, FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered.

Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, may occur with FINTEPLA, particularly with concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs, including, but not limited to, selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), bupropion, triptans, dietary supplements (eg, St. John’s Wort, tryptophan), drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA, dextromethorphan, lithium, tramadol, and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, which include mental status changes (eg, agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (eg, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular signs (eg, hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected, treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.

Increase in Blood Pressure

FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported rarely in adult patients treated with fenfluramine, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA. In clinical trials of up to 3 years in duration, no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis.

Glaucoma

Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.

Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence, sedation, lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue, malaise, asthenia; ataxia, balance disorder, gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling, salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.

Drug Interactions

Strong CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 Inducers: Coadministration with rifampin or a strong CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 inducer will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations.

Consider an increase in FINTEPLA dosage when coadministered with rifampin or a strong CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 inducer.

Use in Specific Populations

Administration to patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.

35674,EMA Anticipates the EC's Conditional Marketing Authorization for Gilead's Remdesivir in Coming Week,First COVID-19 treatment recommended for EU authorisation,"EMA’s CHMP has recommended conditional marketing authorization to Veklury (remdesivir) for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged ≥12yrs. with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen, making it the first treatment to be approved in EU
 EMA expects the EC to grant conditional marketing authorization for remdesivir next week using a fast-track process, allowing the drug to be commercialized across the 27 EU countries
 Gilead must submit final data for remdesivir studies till Dec’2020 and additional data on quality and final mortality data till Aug’2020. The CHMP’s recommendation follows the US FDA’s decision to authorize drug for emergency use last month","EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) has recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation to Veklury (remdesivir) for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen.

Remdesivir is the first medicine against COVID-19 to be recommended for authorisation in the EU. Data on remdesivir were assessed in an exceptionally short timeframe through a rolling review procedure, an approach used by EMA during public health emergencies to assess data as they become available. From 30 April 2020, the CHMP began assessing data on quality and manufacturing, non-clinical data, preliminary clinical data and supporting safety data from compassionate use programmes, well in advance of the submission of the marketing authorisation application on 5 June.

The assessment of the dossier has now concluded with today’s recommendation, which is mainly based on data from study NIAID-ACTT-11, sponsored by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), plus supporting data from other studies on remdesivir.

Study NIAID-ACTT-1 evaluated the effectiveness of a planned 10-day course of remdesivir in over 1,000 hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) and the main measure of effectiveness was patients’ time to recovery (defined as no longer being hospitalised and/or requiring home oxygen or being hospitalised but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care).

Overall, the study showed that patients treated with remdesivir recovered after about 11 days, compared with 15 days for patients given placebo. This effect was not observed in patients with mild to moderate disease: time to recovery was 5 days for both the remdesivir group and the placebo group. For patients with severe disease, who constituted approximately 90% of the study population, time to recovery was 12 days in the remdesivir group and 18 days in the placebo group. However, no difference was seen in time to recovery in patients who started remdesivir when they were already on mechanical ventilation or ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Data on the proportion of patients who died up to 28 days after starting treatment are currently being collected for final analysis.

Taking into consideration the available data, the Agency considered that the balance of benefits and risks had been shown to be positive in patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen; i.e., the patients with severe disease. Remdesivir is given by infusion (drip) into a vein and its use is limited to healthcare facilities in which patients can be monitored closely; liver and kidney function should be monitored before and during treatment, as appropriate. Treatment should start with a 200-mg infusion on the first day, followed by one 100-mg infusion a day for at least 4 days and no more than 9 days.

Remdesivir is recommended for a conditional marketing authorisation, one of the EU regulatory mechanisms to facilitate early access to medicines that fulfil an unmet medical need, including in emergency situations in response to public health threats such as the current pandemic. This type of approval allows the Agency to recommend a medicine for marketing authorisation with less complete data than normally expected, if the benefit of a medicine’s immediate availability to patients outweighs the risk inherent to the fact that not all the data are yet available.

In order to better characterise the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir, the company will have to submit the final reports of the remdesivir studies to the Agency by December 2020, and further data on the quality of the medicine, as well as the final data on mortality, by August 2020. As for all medicines, a risk management plan (RMP) will ensure rigorous safety monitoring of remdesivir once authorised across the EU. Further efficacy and safety data will be collected through on-going studies and post-marketing reports and will be regularly reviewed by the CHMP and EMA’s safety committee (PRAC). Since April 2020, the PRAC has also been reviewing safety data on patients treated outside clinical studies, which are being submitted as monthly safety reports; these will continue to be submitted and assessed after the medicine is on the market.

During the assessment of remdesivir, the CHMP had the support of experts from the COVID-19 EMA pandemic task force (COVID-ETF), which was established to bring together the most relevant expertise from the European medicines regulatory network to assist Member States and the European Commission in dealing with the development, authorisation and safety monitoring of medicines and vaccines against COVID-19.

The European Commission, which was kept informed by EMA throughout the evaluation, will fast-track the decision-making process and aims to grant a decision on the conditional marketing authorisation for remdesivir in the coming week, allowing the product to be marketed in the EU.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/gilead-6.jpg,COVID-19|Pharma,Gilead,Remdesivir,COVID-19 | Pharma | Anticipates | Conditiona l Marketing Authorization | EC | EMA | Imminently,publish,26/6/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/first-covid-19-treatment-recommended-for-eu-authorisation/,https://pharmashots.com/35674/ema-to-anticipate-the-ecs-conditional-marketing-authorization-gileads-remdesivir-in-coming-week/

The Biosimilars Generation seeks to increase awareness on the benefits of biosimilars, their proven safety and efficacy, and the opportunities they present to the healthcare system to realize cost savings.
At the heart of the campaign, evidence-based digital resource, BiosimilarsGeneration.ca, aims to provide information on biosimilars and the perspectives from research and clinical communities, as well as patient organizations.
BOUCHERVILLE, Quebec, June 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sandoz, a global leader in generic and biosimilar medicines, announced today the launch in Canada of The Biosimilars Generation campaign to help Canadians better understand the benefits of biosimilars, their proven safety and efficacy, and the opportunities they present to the healthcare system to realize savings and increase access to innovative new medicines.

The Biosimilars Generation is a starting point to facilitate discussion around biosimilars and inform a generation of Canadians interested in helping sustain our healthcare system. Through increased awareness, the campaign seeks to provide fact and evidence-based information and education to patients, healthcare providers and all Canadians about biosimilar medicines.

“We see patients, their healthcare providers, policy makers and all Canadians as a new generation that will be impacted by the scientific and economic advances, as well as health outcomes, from the arrival and expanded use of biosimilars over the next decade,” said Michel Robidoux, President and General Manager, Sandoz Canada. “Biologic medicines have transformed the treatment of many complex diseases; however, the cost of these medicines is also putting financial strain on our healthcare system, now even under more pressure due to the coronavirus pandemic. We are committed to increasing patient access to biosimilar medicines that can help alleviate this budget pressure by bringing economies and value to patients and provinces – safely and responsibly.”

The campaign kicks off today with the launch of the website, BiosimilarsGeneration.ca, which will help support and educate Canadians and provide them a global perspective by including policy updates from public drug plans, as well as information from Canadian, international research and clinical communities, and patient organizations representing Canadians living with chronic diseases who take biologic medicines.

Responding to the implementation of biosimilars transition initiatives in British Columbia and Alberta in 2019, the entry of oncology biosimilars in hospitals and cancer centres, and increased interest from the general public, The Biosimilars Generation reflects the ongoing conversations between various stakeholders across the country, including physicians, patient groups, and caregivers.

“There is an increasing demand for credible, fact-based information from Canadians looking to learn more about the safety, efficacy and value of biosimilar medicines, particularly as provinces are implementing biosimilar switch policies,” said Karine Matteau, Vice President Hospitals & Physicians Channel / Head of Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz Canada. “The Biosimilars Generation not only addresses this need within a community – of patients, healthcare providers and all Canadians – it shows that we are all in it together, to be informed, empowered and supported.”

About Biosimilars
As patents and data protection expire for original-brand medicines, other manufacturers may produce new versions of the biologic medicines called biosimilars. To receive Health Canada authorization, a biosimilar must demonstrate it is highly similar and has no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety compared to an original-brand (“reference”) biologic1. Since 2009, Health Canada has approved 24 biosimilars of original-brand biologics present on the Canadian market2.

The Patented Medicines Pricing Review Board has estimated that private and public drug plans across Canada could save from $332 million CDN to $1.81 billion CDN in the third year following biosimilar entry across a portfolio of product3.

The broader use of biosimilar medicines, including the implementation of biosimilar switching policies, can also help public and private drug plans improve their sustainability by adding new medicine listings and boosting existing medication coverage for patients. Sandoz Canada believes that in the short term, during and immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the cost savings benefits of biosimilars is one potential answer to the challenges faced by the Canadian healthcare system as public drug plans, hospitals and cancer centres strive to continue to deliver high quality patient treatment care under major budget constraints.

Sandoz Canada is a pioneer, a leader and trusted supplier of high-quality biosimilars based on the global experience and capabilities of Sandoz GmbH, a division of Novartis, in the development, manufacturing and commercialization of biosimilars since 1996. Sandoz launched the first biosimilar in Europe in 2006 and in the Canadian market in 2009.

About Sandoz Canada
Sandoz Canada is a division of Sandoz International GmbH, a world leader in generics and biosimilars and a division of the Swiss multinational Novartis AG. A true leader in its field, Sandoz Canada markets and distributes a wide range of generics, biosimilars and specialty products.

 Percept PC DBS system features 3T and 1.5T full-body MRI scans, smart battery and low pulse width and has received CE mark in Jan’2020
 Mayo Clinic will be the first to implant the Medtronic’s DBS system in the US. DBS is an individualized therapy delivered from a small pacemaker-like device, placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen, to send electrical signals through leads to a targeted area in the brain related to the symptoms of a neurological disorder","Next-Generation Technology Makes Percept™ the First and Only DBS System with Ability to Capture Patient-Specific Brain Signals 
for More Personalized, Data-Driven Treatment 

DUBLIN, June 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announces it received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the Percept™ PC Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system. BrainSense™ technology makes Percept the first and only DBS neurostimulation system with the ability to chronically capture and record brain signals while delivering therapy to patients with neurologic disorders associated with Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, dystonia, epilepsy or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Physicians can now track patient brain signals and correlate these with patient-recorded actions or experiences, such as symptoms, side-effects, or medication intake. This enables more personalized, data-driven neurostimulation treatment.

Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., will be the first in the United States to implant the newly approved device. “Our goal is for patients to regain independence, and we know that DBS can significantly improve motor function in people with Parkinson’s disease compared to standard medication alone,” said Bryan Klassen, M.D., neurologist, Mayo Clinic. “We can now more precisely tailor therapy to the individual needs of each patient based on data from neuronal activity.”

DBS is an individualized therapy delivered from a small pacemaker-like device, placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen, to send electrical signals through very thin wires (leads) to a targeted area in the brain related to the symptoms of a neurological disorder, such as Parkinson’s disease.

“With movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease, even sharing a meal and holding utensils can be a challenge,” said John L. Lehr, president and chief executive officer of the Parkinson’s Foundation. “We’re excited by new treatments and clinical advancements that let people with Parkinson’s live fuller, more complete, lives.”

In addition to BrainSense technology, the Percept PC DBS system features several leading-edge innovations, including:

The only DBS system eligible for 3T and 1.5T full-body MRI scans, providing patients access to cutting-edge medical imaging
Smart battery for personalized prediction of remaining battery life providing elevated peace of mind while planning for device replacement
Improved battery longevity compared to Medtronic’s Activa™ PC neurostimulator (when using similar settings and functionality) in a smaller (reduced volume), ergonomic design for patient comfort
Low pulse width (duration of the pulse), providing expanded stimulation options
Enhanced Patient Programmer leveraging a user-friendly, custom-configured Samsung mobile device that allows patients to manage their therapy easily
Designed to facilitate expanded capabilities in the future via software upgrades – to prepare for what’s next in DBS
“There is nothing that can replace clinical judgement in treating patients. For the first time, this technology gives clinicians feedback directly from the DBS patient’s brain,” said Mike Daly, vice president and general manager of the Brain Modulation business, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group at Medtronic. “With such data-driven, patient-specific insights, we believe it can change the standard of care.”

 Ultomiris is the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor, administered every month, reducing the treatment burden in adults and children and has received the US FDA’s approval in Oct’2019 while the approval in Japan in under review for aHUS","– ULTOMIRIS is the first and only long-acting C5 inhibitor for aHUS, administered every other month, reducing the treatment burden for adults and children –

– ULTOMIRIS has the potential to become the new standard of care in Europe for the treatment of aHUS –

– aHUS is an ultra-rare disease which may progressively damage the kidney and other organs1,2 –

BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Jun. 29, 2020– Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced that the European Commission has approved ULTOMIRIS® (ravulizumab)—the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor administered every eight weeks*—for the treatment of adults and children with a body weight of 10 kg or above with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have received SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) for at least three months and have evidence of response to eculizumab.

“The consequences of aHUS are severe and potentially life-threatening, creating significant challenges and uncertainty for patients and their families. The goal of aHUS treatment is to prevent the body from attacking itself through the inhibition of uncontrolled C5 complement activation – a part of the body’s immune system,” said Prof. Dr. Hermann Haller, Clinic for Nephrology, University Hannover, Germany. “Clinical study results showed that both adults and children with aHUS had immediate and complete C5 inhibition following the first dose of ULTOMIRIS sustained for up to eight weeks. In addition to having demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits in people with aHUS, ULTOMIRIS provides greater freedom with significantly fewer infusions per year.”

Atypical HUS is an ultra-rare disease that can cause progressive injury to vital organs, primarily the kidneys, via damage to the walls of blood vessels and blood clots. Atypical HUS affects both adults and children and many patients present in critical condition in the hospital setting, often requiring supportive care, including dialysis, in an intensive care unit. The prognosis of aHUS can be poor in many cases, with 56 percent of adults and 29 percent of children developing end-stage renal disease or dying within a year of diagnosis with supportive care alone,3 so a timely and accurate diagnosis – in addition to treatment – is critical to improving patient outcomes. 

“At Alexion, our goal is to continue to improve the lives of people and families affected by aHUS and other serious rare diseases,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research & Development at Alexion. “Treatment with ULTOMIRIS offers convenient eight-week dosing, which we believe is preferred by patients because it provides them with greater flexibility and improved quality of life, while also reducing the burden on healthcare systems that currently face significant strain in many countries. Today’s marketing authorization marks an important step in our efforts to establish ULTOMIRIS as the new standard of care for the aHUS patient community.”

The European Commission approval is based on data from two global, single-arm open-label studies of ULTOMIRIS – one in adults and one in children, referred to as pediatrics in the study – with aHUS. Both studies are ongoing. A total of 18 out of 21 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve children and 56 out of 58 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve adults were enrolled and included in the interim analysis. Efficacy evaluation of Complete TMA Response was defined by normalization of hematologic parameters (platelet count and LDH) and improved kidney function (as measured by ≥25 percent improvement in serum creatinine from baseline). In the initial 26-week treatment periods, 54 percent of adults and 77.8 percent (interim data) of children demonstrated Complete TMA Response. Treatment with ULTOMIRIS resulted in normalization of platelet count in 84 percent of adults and 94 percent of children, normalization of LDH (marker of hemolysis) in 77 percent of adults and 90 percent of children, and improved kidney function in 59 percent of adults and 83 percent (interim data) of children (for patients on dialysis at enrollment, baseline was established after they had come off dialysis). In the 52-week follow-up period, 4 additional adult patients and 3 pediatric patients had a Complete TMA Response that was confirmed after the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period resulting in an overall Complete TMA Response of 61 percent in adults and 94 percent in children (interim data). Treatment with ULTOMIRIS resulted in normalization of platelet count in 86 percent of adults and 94 percent of children, normalization of LDH (marker of hemolysis) in 84 percent of adults and 94 percent of children, and improved kidney function in 63 percent of adults and 94 percent (interim data) of children (for patients on dialysis at enrollment, baseline was established after they had come off dialysis). A second cohort of 10 pediatric patients who were SOLIRIS-experienced were included in the pediatric study, demonstrating that switching to ULTOMIRIS maintained disease control as evidenced by stable hematologic and renal parameters, with no apparent impact on safety.

The most frequently observed adverse reactions reported in these studies were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, nasopharyngitis, and pyrexia. Serious meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with ULTOMIRIS, however in aHUS studies, no meningococcal infections occurred in the 89 patients receiving treatment with ULTOMIRIS. To minimize the risk for patients, specific risk-mitigation plans, including a Risk Management Plan, have been established for ULTOMIRIS.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ULTOMIRIS for the treatment of aHUS to inhibit TMA for adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients in October 2019. A regulatory filing for marketing authorization of ULTOMIRIS for the treatment of aHUS in Japan is currently under review. ULTOMIRIS is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in the U.S and Japan, and in the EU as a treatment for adult patients with PNH with hemolysis with clinical symptoms indicative of high disease activity and also for adult patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past six months.

About Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS)

Atypical HUS is an ultra-rare disease that can cause progressive injury to vital organs, primarily the kidneys, via damage to the walls of blood vessels and blood clots. Atypical HUS occurs when the complement system—a part of the body’s immune system—over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. Atypical HUS can cause sudden organ failure or a slow loss of function over time—potentially resulting in the need for a transplant, and in some cases, death. Atypical HUS affects both adults and children, and many patients present in critical condition, often requiring supportive care, including dialysis, in an intensive care unit. The prognosis of aHUS can be poor in many cases, so a timely and accurate diagnosis—in addition to treatment—is critical to improving patient outcomes. Available tests can help distinguish aHUS from other hemolytic diseases with similar symptoms.

About ULTOMIRIS®

ULTOMIRIS® (ravulizumab) is the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor. The medication works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. ULTOMIRIS is administered intravenously every eight weeks or every four weeks for pediatric patients less than 20 kg, following a loading dose. ULTOMIRIS is approved in the United States (U.S.), European Union (EU) and Japan as a treatment for adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and in the U.S. for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients.

U.S. INDICATIONS & IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ULTOMIRIS (ravulizumab-cwvz) 300 mg / 30 mL injection for intravenous use

U.S. INDICATIONS

ULTOMIRIS is a prescription medicine called a monoclonal antibody. ULTOMIRIS is used to treat adults with a disease called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). ULTOMIRIS is used to treat adults and children 1 month of age and older with a disease called atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). ULTOMIRIS is not used in treating people with Shiga toxin E. coli related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). It is not known if ULTOMIRIS is safe and effective in children with PNH. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS is safe and effective in children younger than 1 month of age.

U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

ULTOMIRIS is a medicine that affects the immune system. ULTOMIRIS can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. ULTOMIRIS increases the chance of getting serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections. Meningococcal infections may quickly become life-threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early.

Meningococcal vaccines must be received at least 2 weeks before the first dose of ULTOMIRIS if one has not already had this vaccine. If one’s doctor decided that urgent treatment with ULTOMIRIS is needed, meningococcal vaccination should be administered as soon as possible. If one has not been vaccinated and ULTOMIRIS therapy must be initiated immediately, 2 weeks of antibiotics should also be administered with the vaccinations. If one had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, additional vaccination might be needed before starting ULTOMIRIS. One’s doctor will decide if additional meningococcal vaccination is needed. Meningococcal vaccines reduce the risk of meningococcal infection but do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Call one’s doctor or get emergency medical care right away if any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection occur: headache with nausea or vomiting, headache and fever, headache with a stiff neck or stiff back, fever, fever and a rash, confusion, muscle aches with flu-like symptoms, and eyes sensitive to light. One’s doctor will give a Patient Safety Card about the risk of meningococcal infection. Carry the card at all times during treatment and for 8 months after your ULTOMIRIS dose.

ULTOMIRIS is only available through a program called the ULTOMIRIS REMS.

ULTOMIRIS may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections. People who take ULTOMIRIS may have an increased risk of getting infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Certain people may also have an increased risk of gonorrhea infection. To find out if one is at risk for gonorrhea infection, about gonorrhea prevention, and regular testing, talk to the doctor. Call the doctor right away if one has any new signs or symptoms of infection.

Do not receive ULTOMIRIS if one has a meningococcal infection, or has not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection unless the doctor decides that urgent treatment with ULTOMIRIS is needed.

Before one receives ULTOMIRIS, tell the doctor about all of the medical conditions, including if one: has an infection or fever, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS will harm an unborn baby. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS passes into the breast milk. One should not breastfeed during treatment and for 8 months after one’s final dose of ULTOMIRIS.

Tell the doctor about all the medicines one takes, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. ULTOMIRIS and other medicines can affect each other causing side effects. Know the medicines one takes and the vaccines one receives. Keep a list of them to show the doctor and pharmacist when one gets a new medicine.

If one has PNH and stops receiving ULTOMIRIS, the doctor will need to monitor closely for at least 16 weeks after one stops ULTOMIRIS. Stopping ULTOMIRIS may cause breakdown of the red blood cells due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen due to red blood cell breakdown include: drop in the red blood cell count, tiredness, blood in the urine, stomach-area (abdomen) pain, shortness of breath, blood clots, trouble swallowing, and erectile dysfunction (ED) in males. If one has aHUS, the doctor will need to monitor closely for at least 12 months after stopping treatment for signs of worsening aHUS symptoms or problems related to a type of abnormal clotting and breakdown of the red blood cells called thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Symptoms or problems that can happen with TMA may include: confusion or loss of consciousness, seizures, chest pain (angina), difficulty breathing, and blood clots or stroke. If one misses an ULTOMIRIS infusion, call the doctor right away.

ULTOMIRIS can cause serious side effects including infusion reactions. Infusion reactions may happen during one’s ULTOMIRIS infusion. Symptoms of an infusion reaction with ULTOMIRIS may include lower back pain, pain with the infusion, feeling faint or discomfort in the arms or legs. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if these symptoms develop, or any other symptoms during the ULTOMIRIS infusion that may mean one is having a serious infusion reaction, including: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, and feel faint or pass out. One’s doctor will treat the symptoms as needed.

The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people treated for PNH are upper respiratory infection and headache. The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people with aHUS are upper respiratory infections, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, high blood pressure, and fever.

Please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for ULTOMIRIS, including Boxed WARNING regarding serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections/sepsis.

ENSPRYNG is the first and only approved therapy targeting the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor given subcutaneously every four weeks
Approval is supported by data demonstrating ENSPRYNG’s robust efficacy, which was well-tolerated with a consistent safety profile, in a broad NMOSD population as a monotherapy and as an add-on therapy
Asia has a high prevalence of NMOSD with limited treatment options
 
Basel, 29 June 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved ENSPRYNG® (satralizumab) for the prevention of relapses of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), including NMO, for aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-IgG) seropositive adults and children. ENSPRYNG demonstrated robust efficacy and significantly reduced the risk of relapse across a broad NMOSD patient population in two pivotal Phase III studies, as a monotherapy and as an add-on therapy to baseline immunosuppressant therapy (IST), and is dosed subcutaneously every four weeks.

NMOSD is commonly associated with pathogenic antibodies (AQP4-IgG) that target and damage a specific cell type, called astrocytes, resulting in inflammatory lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain. AQP4-IgG antibodies are detectable in the blood serum of around 70-80% of NMOSD patients, and these patients tend to experience a more severe disease course. Although most cases of NMOSD can be confirmed through a diagnostic test, up to 30% of people living with the condition are still frequently misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

“Today’s approval in Japan is the first for ENSPRYNG in Asia, providing a new treatment option to help reduce NMOSD relapses that cause irreversible disability, such as vision loss and paralysis,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Japan has a high prevalence of NMOSD in both adults and children, but limited approved treatment options. ENSPRYNG offers robust efficacy, is well-tolerated, and is the first and only approved therapy targeting the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor given subcutaneously every four weeks.”

ENSPRYNG is a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 receptor, believed to play a key role in the inflammation that occurs in people with NMOSD. ENSPRYNG was designed by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., a member of the Roche group, using novel antibody recycling technology. Compared to conventional technology, this allows for longer duration of antibody circulation and maximum inhibition of IL-6 signalling, while minimising safety risks in a chronic disease setting. People with NMOSD experience unpredictable, severe relapses directly causing cumulative, irreversible neurological damage and disability. Preventing relapses through early treatment can have a positive impact on preventing disability and is the primary goal for NMOSD disease management.

ENSPRYNG was recently approved in Canada under priority review, as a monotherapy or as an add-on therapy to baseline IST, for the treatment of NMOSD in adult and adolescent patients who are AQP4-IgG seropositive. In October 2019, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the marketing applications for ENSPRYNG for the treatment of NMOSD. The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommendation and the FDA decision are expected in 2020. In April 2020, China’s Centre for Drug Evaluation (CDE) accepted a licensing application for ENSPRYNG.

The approval of ENSPRYNG in Japan is based on data including the two pivotal Phase III studies, SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky, evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENSPRYNG as a monotherapy and as an add-on therapy to baseline IST, respectively.

In the overall population, a reduction in the risk of relapse was observed in both pivotal studies:
In SAkuraSky, the risk of relapse was reduced by 62% (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16–0.88; p=0.0184) with ENSPRYNG, compared to placebo (both treatment arms as an add-on therapy to baseline IST)
In SAkuraStar, the risk of relapse was reduced by 55% (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23–0.89; p=0.0184) with ENSPRYNG monotherapy, compared to placebo
In the pre-specified subgroup of AQP4-IgG seropositive patients, a reduction in the risk of relapse was observed in both pivotal studies:
In SAkuraSky, the risk of relapse was reduced by 79% (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06–0.75) with ENSPRYNG, compared to placebo (both treatment arms as an add-on therapy to baseline IST)
In SAkuraStar, the risk of relapse was reduced by 74% (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.11–0.63) with ENSPRYNG monotherapy, compared to placebo
Overall, the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was similar between the ENSPRYNG and placebo groups in both studies. A lower rate of infections (including serious infections) was observed in patients treated with ENSPRYNG compared with the placebo group. The safety profile in longer term follow up is consistent with the double-blind period.
About SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky in NMOSD
SAkuraStar is a Phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENSPRYNG monotherapy administered to patients with NMOSD. The primary endpoint is the time to first protocol-defined relapse (PDR), adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period. Results from the SAkuraStar study were presented at the 35th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) in 2019, and were published in The Lancet Neurology in April 2020.

Ninety-five patients aged from 20-70 years were randomised to either of the following two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio: ENSPRYNG (120 mg) or placebo. Both treatments were administered subcutaneously at week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4-week intervals. The double-blind treatment period ended at 1.5 years after the enrollment of the last patient. After experiencing a PDR or upon completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with ENSPRYNG in an open-label extension (OLE) period. Patients with AQP4-IgG seropositive or seronegative neuromyelitis optica (NMO, as defined by the diagnostic criteria in 2006) and those with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD were enrolled. The overall population in the SAkuraStar study is representative of the types of NMOSD patients seen in real-world clinical practice, which includes 70-80% of patients diagnosed as AQP4-IgG seropositive.

SAkuraSky is a Phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENSPRYNG as an add-on therapy to baseline IST in patients with NMOSD. The primary endpoint was the time to first PDR as adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period. Results from the SAkuraSky study were published in the November 28, 2019 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

Eighty-three male and female patients aged from 13 to 73 years were randomised to either of the following two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio: ENSPRYNG (120 mg) or placebo added to baseline therapy (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and/or corticosteroids). Both treatments were administered subcutaneously at week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4-week intervals. The double-blind treatment ended when patients experienced a PDR; the study ended when the total number of PDRs reached 26. After experiencing a PDR or upon completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with ENSPRYNG in an OLE period. Patients with AQP4-IgG seropositive or seronegative neuromyelitis optica (NMO, as defined by diagnostic criteria in 2006) and those with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD were enrolled. The overall population in the SAkuraSky study is representative of the types of NMOSD patients seen in real-world clinical practice, which includes 70-80% of patients diagnosed as AQP4-IgG seropositive.

About ENSPRYNG® (satralizumab)
ENSPRYNG, which was designed by Chugai, a member of the Roche group, is an investigational humanised monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 receptor. The cytokine IL-6 is thought to be a key driver in NMOSD, triggering the inflammation cascade and leading to damage and disability. ENSPRYNG was designed using novel antibody recycling technology. Compared to conventional technology, this allows for longer duration of antibody circulation and maximum inhibition of IL-6 signalling, while minimising safety risks in a chronic disease setting.

Positive Phase III results for ENSPRYNG, as both monotherapy and as an add-on to baseline IST, suggest that IL-6 inhibition may be an effective therapeutic approach for NMOSD. The Phase III clinical development programme for ENSPRYNG includes two studies: SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky.

About neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)
NMOSD is a rare, lifelong and debilitating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that primarily damages the optic nerve(s) and spinal cord, causing blindness, muscle weakness and paralysis. People with NMOSD experience unpredictable, severe relapses directly causing cumulative, permanent, neurological damage and disability. In some cases, relapse can result in death. NMOSD affects over 10,000 people in Europe, 15,000 people in the US and approximately 200,000 people worldwide. The disease is most common among non-Caucasian women in their 30s and 40s.

NMOSD is commonly associated with pathogenic antibodies (AQP4-IgG) that target and damage a specific cell type, called astrocytes, resulting in inflammatory lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain. AQP4-IgG antibodies are detectable in the blood serum of around 70-80% of NMOSD patients.

Although most cases of NMOSD can be confirmed through a diagnostic test, people living with the condition are still frequently misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This is due to overlapping characteristics of the two disorders, including a higher prevalence in women, similar symptoms and the fact that both are relapse-based conditions.

35825,Gilead Unveils the Price of Remdesivir as $390 per Vial in Developed Countries,"An Open Letter from Daniel O’Day, Chairman & CEO, Gilead Sciences","Gilead will price its COVID-19 treatment at $390/ vial in the US and other developed countries, with a 5days treatment course of 6 vials costing $2340/ patient while the price for private insurance companies will be $520/ vial
 Pricing the remdesivir at low value ensures the broad and equitable access for the therapy during the pandemic. The company has signed an agreement with HHS where HHS and states will decide on hospital allocations of the therapy until the end of Sept’2020. After that, HHS will not handle the allocation
 In developing countries, Gilead collaborated with multiple generic makers to deliver remdesivir at low cost","In the weeks since we learned of remdesivir’s potential against COVID-19, one topic has attracted more speculation than any other: what price we might set for the medicine. This degree of speculation is understandable. Remdesivir, our investigational treatment, is the first antiviral to have demonstrated patient improvement in clinical trials for COVID-19 and there is no playbook for how to price a new medicine in a pandemic. We are aware of the significant responsibility that comes with pricing remdesivir, and the need to be transparent on our decision. After giving this the considerable care, time and amount of discussion that it merits, we are now ready to share our decision and explain how we reached it.

As with all our actions on remdesivir, we approached this with the aim of helping as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible and in the most responsible way. This has been our compass point throughout, from collaborating to find rapid answers on safety and efficacy, to scaling up manufacturing and donating our supply of remdesivir through the end of June. In each case, we recognized the need to do things differently to reflect the exceptional circumstances of the pandemic. Now, as we transition beyond the donation period and set a price for remdesivir, the same principle applies.

In normal circumstances, we would price a medicine according to the value it provides. The first results from the NIAID study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 showed that remdesivir shortened time to recovery by an average of four days. Taking the example of the United States, earlier hospital discharge would result in hospital savings of approximately $12,000 per patient. Even just considering these immediate savings to the healthcare system alone, we can see the potential value that remdesivir provides. This is before we factor in the direct benefit to those patients who may have a shorter stay in the hospital.

We have decided to price remdesivir well below this value. To ensure broad and equitable access at a time of urgent global need, we have set a price for governments of developed countries of $390 per vial. Based on current treatment patterns, the vast majority of patients are expected to receive a 5-day treatment course using 6 vials of remdesivir, which equates to $2,340 per patient.

Part of the intent behind our decision was to remove the need for country by country negotiations on price. We discounted the price to a level that is affordable for developed countries with the lowest purchasing power. This price will be offered to all governments in developed countries around the world where remdesivir is approved or authorized for use. At the current price of $390 per vial, remdesivir is positioned to achieve the aim of providing immediate net savings for healthcare systems.

In the U.S., the same government price of $390 per vial will apply. Because of the way the U.S. system is set up and the discounts that government healthcare programs expect, the price for U.S. private insurance companies, will be $520 per vial. At the level we have priced remdesivir and with government programs in place, along with additional Gilead assistance as needed, we believe all patients will have access.

Gilead has entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) whereby HHS and states will continue to manage allocation to hospitals until the end of September. After this period, once supplies are less constrained, HHS will no longer manage allocation.

In the developing world, where healthcare resources, infrastructure and economics are so different, we have entered into agreements with generic manufacturers to deliver treatment at a substantially lower cost. These alternative solutions are designed to ensure that all countries in the world can provide access to treatment.

Our work on remdesivir is far from done. We continue to explore its potential to help in this pandemic in various ways, such as evaluating treatment earlier in the course of the disease, in outpatient settings, with an inhaled formulation, in additional patient groups and in combination with other therapies. As we accumulate more data from global clinical trials and initiate many additional studies, we will understand more about the full value of remdesivir over time. Our teams also remain focused on increasing supplies to meet the high global demand. By the end of this year, we expect our investment on the development and manufacture of remdesivir to exceed $1 billion (U.S.) and our commitment will continue through 2021 and beyond.

In making our decision on how to price remdesivir, we considered the full scope of our responsibilities. We started with our immediate responsibility to ensure price is in no way a hindrance to ensuring rapid and broad treatment. We also balanced that with our longer-term responsibilities: to continue with our ongoing work on remdesivir, to maintain our long-term research in antivirals and to invest in scientific innovation that might help generations to come. As with many other aspects of this pandemic, we are in uncharted territory in pricing remdesivir. Ultimately, we were guided by the need to do things differently. As the world continues to reel from the human, social and economic impact of this pandemic, we believe that pricing remdesivir well below value is the right and responsible thing to do.

About Remdesivir
Remdesivir is an antiviral product that is being studied in multiple ongoing international clinical trials. In recognition of the current public health emergency and based on available clinical data, the approval status of remdesivir varies by country. In countries where remdesivir has not been approved by the regional health authority, remdesivir is an investigational drug, and the safety and efficacy of remdesivir have not been established.

Remdesivir has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any use. In the U.S., the FDA granted remdesivir an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. This authorization is temporary and may be revoked, and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process. For information about the authorized use of remdesivir and mandatory requirements of the EUA in the U.S., please review the Fact Sheets and FDA Letter of Authorization available at www.gilead.com/remdesivir.

35867,AstraZeneca and MSD's Selumetinib Receive MHLW's Orphan Drug Designation for Neurofibromatosis Type 1 in Japan,Selumetinib granted orphan drug designation in Japan for neurofibromatosis type 1,"The ODD designation follows P-I/II SPRINT Stratum 1 study assessing Selumetinib (bid) as monothx. in pediatric patients with NF1-related inoperable PNs
 The P-I/II SPRINT Stratum 1 study demonstrated a reduction in the size of tumors with 66% ORR in children. AstraZeneca and MSD are co-developing and co-commercializing selumetinib which received the US FDA’s approval in Apr’2020 under the brand name “Koselugo”
 Selumetinib is a MEK1/2 inhibitor and has received the US FDA’s BT & RPD designation in 2019, ODD in 2018, and EU and Swissmedic’s ODD in 2018 for pediatric patients with NF1 PN. The MAA for the therapy is under EMA’s reviews with other ongoing global regulatory submissions","Designation follows recent US approval with additional regulatory submissions underway
Phase II SPRINT trial showed selumetinib reduced tumour volume in paediatric patients with NF1 plexiform neurofibromas

AstraZeneca today announced that selumetinib has been granted orphan drug designation (ODD) in Japan for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a rare and debilitating genetic disease.1

Selumetinib is co-developed and co-commercialised with MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada).

Some 30-50% of patients with NF1 experience plexiform neurofibromas (PN) – tumours growing along their nerve sheaths.2 These PN can cause clinical issues such as disfigurement, motor dysfunction, pain, airway dysfunction, visual impairment and bowel/bladder dysfunction.3

The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare grants ODD to medicines intended for the treatment of diseases that affect fewer than 50,000 patients in Japan and for which there is a high unmet medical need.

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Neurofibromatosis type 1 can have a devastating impact on children and new medicines are urgently needed to help treat the resulting plexiform neurofibromas and associated clinical issues. Current options in most countries are limited and this designation is a significant step forward in bringing the first medicine for NF1 to paediatric patients in Japan.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “Plexiform neurofibromas are one of the key manifestations of NF1 and can lead to pain and disfigurement. In the SPRINT trial, selumetinib was shown to reduce the size of these tumours in children. We are hopeful that we will be able to bring this treatment to this underserved paediatric patient community in Japan.”

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP)-sponsored Phase I/II SPRINT Stratum 1 trial showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 66% (33 of 50 patients, confirmed partial response) in paediatric patients with NF1 PN when treated with selumetinib as a twice-daily oral monotherapy. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed complete or partial response of at least 20% reduction in tumour volume.

AstraZeneca and MSD are jointly developing and commercialising selumetinib which was approved in the US in April 2020 under the medicine name Koselugo for the treatment of paediatric patients two years and older with NF1 and symptomatic, inoperable PN. A marketing authorisation application in NF1 PN was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency earlier in the year and further global regulatory submissions are underway.

NF1

NF1 is a debilitating genetic disease that affects one in every 3,000 to 4,000 individuals.1 It is caused by a spontaneous or inherited mutation in the NF1 gene and is associated with many symptoms, including soft lumps on and under the skin (cutaneous neurofibromas) and skin pigmentation (so-called ‘café au lait’ spots)1 and, in 30-50% of patients, tumours develop on the nerve sheaths (plexiform neurofibromas).2 These plexiform neurofibromas can cause clinical issues such as disfigurement, motor dysfunction, pain, airway dysfunction, visual impairment, and bladder/bowel dysfunction.3 PN begin during early childhood, with varying degrees of severity, and can reduce life expectancy by 8 to 15 years.1,4,5

SPRINT

The SPRINT Stratum 1 Phase I/II trial was designed to evaluate the objective response rate and impact on patient-reported and functional outcomes in paediatric patients with NF1-related inoperable PNs treated with selumetinib monotherapy.6 Results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.7 This trial sponsored by NCI CTEP was conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between NCI and AstraZeneca with additional support from the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP).

Selumetinib

Selumetinib (available in the US under the medicine name Koselugo) is an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2).6 MEK1/2 proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. Both MEK and ERK are critical components of the RAS-regulated RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, which is often activated in different types of cancers.

Selumetinib was granted US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation in April 2019, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in December 2019, Orphan Drug Designation in February 2018, EU orphan designation in August 2018 and Swissmedic orphan drug status in December 2018 for the treatment of paediatric patients with NF1 PN.

AstraZeneca and MSD Strategic Oncology Collaboration

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and Koselugo, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

Data showed that 85% of patients preferred Phesgo compared to standard intravenous administration
 
Basel, 29 June 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Phesgo™, a fixed-dose combination of Perjeta® (pertuzumab) and Herceptin® (trastuzumab) with hyaluronidase, administered by subcutaneous (SC; under the skin) injection in combination with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, for the treatment of early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. This is the first time that Roche has combined two monoclonal antibodies that can be administered by a single SC injection.

“The FDA approval of Phesgo reflects our commitment to improving outcomes for the many people living with HER2-positive breast cancer,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Phesgo offers a treatment administration that supports the needs and preferences of individual patients, and helps to meet the increasing demand across the healthcare system for faster and more flexible treatment options.”

Phesgo is available in one single-dose vial. Administration can take approximately eight minutes for the initial loading dose and approximately five minutes for each subsequent maintenance dose. [1] This is compared to approximately 150 minutes for a sequential infusion of a loading dose of Perjeta and Herceptin using the standard IV formulations, and between 60-150 minutes for subsequent maintenance infusions of the two medicines. [2, 3] Phesgo can be administered by a healthcare professional in a treatment centre or at a patient’s home.

The approval is based on results from the pivotal phase III FeDeriCa study, which met its primary endpoint with Phesgo showing non-inferior levels of Perjeta in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough), when compared to IV administration of Perjeta. The safety profile of Phesgo with chemotherapy was comparable to IV administration of Perjeta plus Herceptin and chemotherapy, and no new safety signals were identified, including no meaningful difference in cardiac toxicity. The most common adverse events in both arms were alopecia, nausea, diarrhoea and anaemia. [1, 4]

The phase II PHranceSCa study showed that 85% (136/160) of people receiving treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer preferred treatment under the skin to IV administration due to less time in the clinic and more comfortable treatment administration. [1]

About the FeDeriCa study [4, 5]
FeDeriCa is an international, multi-centre, two-arm, randomised, open-label, pivotal phase III study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injection of Phesgo in combination with chemotherapy, compared with standard intravenous (IV) infusions of Perjeta and Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy, in 500 people with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) and adjuvant (after surgery) settings. The primary endpoint of the study is minimum levels of Perjeta in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough), when compared to IV administration of Perjeta. Secondary endpoints include safety; minimum levels of Herceptin in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough); and total pathological complete response, meaning there is no tumour tissue detectable in the tissue removed at the time of surgery.

Data from the FeDeriCa study were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2019. The FeDeriCa study met its primary endpoint of non-inferior levels of Perjeta in the blood. The geometric mean ratio (GMR; a type of average used when assessing pharmacokinetics) for the primary endpoint was 1.22 (90% CI: 1.14 to 1.31), with the lower limit of the 90% CI of the GMR=1.14≥0.80 (the pre-specified non-inferiority margin). A secondary endpoint of non-inferior levels of Herceptin was also met, with blood concentrations for people receiving the fixed-dose combination non-inferior to those receiving IV Herceptin (GMR=1.33 [90% CI: 1.24 to 1.43]; lower limit of 90% CI of GMR=1.24≥0.80). A non-inferiority endpoint was chosen for the study to ensure that people were receiving sufficient dosing with Perjeta and Herceptin as compared to the established IV doses at the same treatment intervals.

About the PHranceSCa study [6]
PHranceSCa is a phase II, randomised, multi-centre, multinational, open-label, cross-over study evaluating patient preference for and satisfaction with subcutaneous administration of Phesgo in 160 people with HER2-positive early breast cancer. All patients completed neoadjuvant (before surgery) treatment with Perjeta, Herceptin and chemotherapy and had surgery before randomisation. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of participants who indicate that they prefer treatment with Phesgo compared to the standard intravenous (IV) formulations of Perjeta and Herceptin. Secondary endpoints include participant-reported satisfaction and health-related quality of life outcomes; healthcare professionals’ perceptions of time and resource use and convenience compared with IV formulations; as well as the safety and efficacy of each study regimen.

Interim results from the PHranceSCa study were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Breast Cancer Virtual Meeting in May 2020. Primary results will be presented at a medical conference later in 2020.

About Phesgo
Phesgo is a new fixed-dose subcutaneous (SC) formulation that combines Perjeta and Herceptin with Halozyme Therapeutics’ Enhanze® drug delivery technology. [1] This is the first time that Roche has combined two monoclonal antibodies that can be administered by a single SC injection.

Halozyme’s Enhanze drug delivery technology may enable and optimise SC drug delivery for appropriate co-administered therapeutics. The technology is based on a proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), an enzyme that temporarily degrades hyaluronan – a glycosaminoglycan or chain of natural sugars in the body – to aid in the dispersion and absorption of other injected therapeutic drugs. [7]

Pertuzumab in Phesgo is the same monoclonal antibody as in intravenous (IV) Perjeta, and trastuzumab in Phesgo is the same monoclonal antibody as in IV Herceptin. The mechanisms of action of Perjeta and Herceptin are believed to complement each other as both bind to the HER2 receptor, but in different locations. The combination of Perjeta and Herceptin is thought to provide a more comprehensive, dual blockade of the HER signalling pathways. [8, 9]

The standard IV formulation of Perjeta in combination with IV Herceptin and chemotherapy (the Perjeta-based regimen) is approved in over 100 countries for the treatment of both early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In the neoadjuvant (before surgery) early breast cancer (eBC) setting, the Perjeta-based regimen has been shown to almost double the rate of pathological complete response compared to Herceptin and chemotherapy. [10] Additionally, the combination has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence of invasive disease or death in the adjuvant (after surgery) eBC setting. [11] In the metastatic setting, the combination has shown an unprecedented survival benefit in previously untreated (first-line) patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. [12]

About Roche’s medicines for HER2-positive breast cancer
Roche has been leading research into the HER2 pathway for over 30 years and is committed to improving the health, quality of life and survival of people with both early and metastatic HER2-positive disease. HER2-positive breast cancer is a particularly aggressive form of the disease that affects approximately 15-20% of patients. [13] Roche has developed three innovative medicines that have helped transform the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer: Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla® (trastuzumab emtansine). Eligibility for treatment with Roche’s HER2-targeted medicines is determined via a diagnostic test which identifies people who will likely benefit from these medicines at the onset of their disease.

· The positive Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) opinion recommends expanding the marketing authorisation for the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of Remsima® for use in an additional five indications,including for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS); the CHMP’s positive opinion for the SC formulation applies to all previously approved indications for the intravenous (IV)formulation in adult patients

· The CHMP opinion is based on pivotal data evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety between the IV and SC formulations of Remsima® in people with active Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis

· The availability of the novel SC formulation of Remsima® could provide patients with an alternative, more personalised and convenient treatment option

 

FRIDAY 26 JUNE– INCHEON, SOUTH KOREA – Celltrion Healthcare today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended expanding the existing marketing authorisation for the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of Remsima® (CT-P13) in an additional five indications: for the treatment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. This follows the EU marketing authorisation for Remsima® SC for the treatment ofpeoplewith rheumatoid arthritis issued in November 2019.[1]

“Today’s positive CHMP opinion marks an important step forward in furthering our ability as clinicians to meet the needs of people with autoimmune diseases. Remsima®SC could offer patients an alternative administration method that provides adequate exposure during maintenance treatment with infliximab and takes significantly less time than the current intravenous formulation, thereby reducing the time patients need to be in medical settings with infusion administrations,” said Professor Walter Reinisch, Director of the Clinical IBD Study Group, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medizinische Universität Wien. “Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, this is timely and welcome news,particularly for immunocompromised patients who must take extra precaution and only visit hospitals when absolutely necessary.”

The subcutaneous formulation can be administered by patients themselves, thereby providing alternative treatment options giving them greater flexibility and control.

The positive CHMP opinion was supported by data from a pivotal study comparing the pharmacokinetics,efficacy and safety of the subcutaneous and intravenous (IV) formulations of Remsima®in people with active Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, throughout a 1-year treatment period.[2],[3]

Part one of the study showed a comparable overall clinical response of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV as indicated by the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI-70) with similar scores, whereas clinical remission was numerically higher in the SC cohorts at week 54. The safety profiles of CT-P13 in the SC cohorts was comparable to CT-P13 IV up to week 54.2

In part two of the study,131 patients were randomised at the maintenance phase (66 to the SC arm and 65 to the IV arm), of which 105 (80.2%)patients completed the week 54 visit (55 in the SC arm and 50 in the IV arm).After loading doses of IV 5 mg/kg at weeks 0 and 2, patients were randomised at week 6 to receive either SC 120 mg (<80 kg) or 240 mg (≥80 kg) every 2 weeks in the SC arm, or continued on IV 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks in the IV arm.From week 30 onwards, the IV 5 mg/kg group were switched to either SC 120 or 240 mg based on the patients’ body weight.3

The resultsshowed that both the mean CDAI and partial Mayo scores for ulcerative colitis disease activity decreased over time in both arms until week 30, while comparable improvement in clinical activity was observed at week 54 – after switching the remaining IV patients to SC from week 30 of the trial. The rates of clinical response and remission at week 54 were maintained, and the rate of mucosal healing in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis combined was further improved at week 54. After switching, the mean pre-dose serum concentrations in the IV arm increased to a level comparable to the SC arm, and maintained consistent levels until week 54. The overall safety profile during the maintenance phase, and on or after week 30, was comparable between both the SC and IV arms.3

Based on the above results, a 120 mg fixed dose of Remsima®SC has been recommended for use by the CHMP, in adults regardless of the body weight, in both existing and newly added indications.

“Since its first launch, Remsima® has been used for more than 5 years in over 90 countries. This positive CHMP opinion is very encouraging and brings us closer to improving outcomes for more patients who are eligible to receive the subcutaneous formulation,” said Hyoung-Ki Kim, Vice Chairman at Celltrion Healthcare. “If approved bytheEMA, Remsima® will be the first infliximab to have both intravenous and subcutaneous formulations to treat patients with ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.”

Celltrion has completed its application process for patent protection for the Remsima®SC formulation and dosage, until 2037 and 2038 respectively in approximately 100 countries throughout the US, Europe and Asia.

CT-P13 IV is usually given as 3 mg per kg/body weight in RA and as 5 mg per kg/body weight for the other indications. Infliximab IV is given as an infusion over two hours. All patients are monitored for any reactions during the infusion and for at least one to two hours afterwards.

 

About CT-P13 subcutaneous (SC) formulation[5],[6]

A 120 mg fixed dose of CT-P13 SC has been recommended for use by the CHMP, in adults regardless of the body weight, in both existing and newly added indications. CT-P13 SC has three administration options; via a pre-filled pen (auto injector), pre-filled syringe or pre-filled syringe with needle safeguard.The SC formulation has the potential to enhance treatment options for the use of infliximab biosimilar by providing high consistency in drug exposure and a convenient method of administration.

– G1 to retain full development and commercialization rights and book revenue for trilaciclib
-New Drug Application (NDA) for trilaciclib submitted in June 2020

RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. and RIDGEFIELD, Conn., June 30, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — G1 Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GTHX) and Boehringer Ingelheim today announced that the companies have entered into a co-promotion agreement for trilaciclib in the United States and Puerto Rico. Under the terms of the three-year agreement, G1 and Boehringer Ingelheim will collaborate on the commercialization of trilaciclib for its first potential indication in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with the Boehringer Ingelheim oncology commercial team, well-established in lung cancer, leading sales force engagement initiatives. Discovered and developed by G1, trilaciclib is a first-in-class investigational therapy designed to improve outcomes for people with cancer treated with chemotherapy.

“We believe that trilaciclib has the potential to benefit patients with cancer being treated with chemotherapy across a broad range of solid tumors,” said Mark Velleca, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of G1. “Our clinical trials of trilaciclib in small cell lung cancer have demonstrated significant myelopreservation benefits, and we are excited to collaborate with Boehringer Ingelheim’s experienced commercial oncology team to bring this innovative therapy to patients with SCLC. In addition, this capital efficient launch structure provides us with the ability to make investments in a robust development program to assess trilaciclib in other solid tumors, including colorectal cancer and breast cancer.”

Under the terms of the agreement, G1 will book revenue in the United States and Puerto Rico and retain global development and commercialization rights to trilaciclib. In the U.S. and Puerto Rico, G1 will lead marketing, market access and medical engagement initiatives; Boehringer Ingelheim will lead sales force engagements. G1 will make initial payments to Boehringer Ingelheim to cover start-up expenses and pre-approval initiatives to support a successful commercial launch. G1 will pay a promotion fee of a mid-twenties percentage of net sales in the first year of commercialization, which decreases to a low double-digit/high single-digit percentage in the second and third years of commercialization, respectively (subject to certain adjustments for sales above pre-specified levels to reward out-performance). There are no payments due by either party beyond the expiration of the three-year term of the agreement. The agreement does not extend to additional indications that G1 may pursue for trilaciclib.

“Boehringer Ingelheim’s commitment to transform treatment expectations for the oncology community extends beyond research and drives us to explore innovative solutions for patients. We are pleased to be collaborating with G1 Therapeutics and applying our commercial strengths focused on lung cancer to support a new therapy for patients with clear synergies across customer audiences,” said Kelli Moran, Senior Vice President, Specialty Care, Boehringer Ingelheim. “This strategic agreement builds on Boehringer Ingelheim’s achievements in oncology and contributes to our long-term vision to give patients new hope by taking cancer on.”

G1 received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for trilaciclib from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 and submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) in June 2020. More than 25,000 people in the U.S. and Puerto Rico are diagnosed with SCLC each year. Approximately 90% of SCLC patients receive first-line chemotherapy treatment, and approximately 60% of those patients receive subsequent second-line chemotherapy treatment. Chemotherapy is an effective and important weapon against cancer. However, chemotherapy does not differentiate between healthy cells and cancer cells and kills both. One of the most common side effects of chemotherapy is myelosuppression – the result of damage to stem cells in the bone marrow that produce white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. Myelosuppression often requires the administration of rescue interventions such as growth factors and blood or platelet transfusions, and may also result in chemotherapy dose delays and reductions. Immune cell damage may decrease the ability of the immune system to fight the cancer, as well as infection. Trilaciclib has the potential to be the first proactively administered myelopreservation therapy that can make chemotherapy safer and improve the patient experience.

Additional information regarding this agreement is disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by G1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (available here).

About Trilaciclib
Trilaciclib is a first-in-class investigational therapy designed to improve outcomes for people with cancer treated with chemotherapy. Trilaciclib has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation based on positive myelopreservation data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which trilaciclib was administered prior to chemotherapy treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In a randomized trial of women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, trilaciclib improved overall survival when administered prior to chemotherapy. In June 2020, G1 submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for trilaciclib for myelopreservation in SCLC and began a study in neoadjuvant breast cancer as part of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL. The company expects to initiate a Phase 3 trial in colorectal cancer in the fourth quarter of 2020.

First and only FDA-approved immunotherapy to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit in the first-line setting in a Phase III study
In JAVELIN Bladder 100, BAVENCIO maintenance treatment extended median overall survival by 50% over standard of care
Priority review completed under FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, following receipt of Breakthrough Therapy Designation
Rockland, MA and New York, US, JUNE 30, 2020 – EMD Serono, the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany in the US and Canada, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for BAVENCIO® (avelumab) for the maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) that has not progressed with first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy.

The approval is based on results from the Phase III JAVELIN Bladder 100 study, which demonstrated a significant 7.1-month improvement in median overall survival (OS) with BAVENCIO as first-line maintenance plus best supportive care (BSC) compared with BSC alone: 21.4 months (95% CI: 18.9 to 26.1) vs. 14.3 months (95% CI: 12.9 to 17.9).1 This statistically significant improvement in OS represents a 31% reduction in the risk of death in the overall population (HR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.86; 2-sided P=0.001).1 OS was measured from the time of randomization, after patients were treated with four to six cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin over a period of approximately four months.2 The JAVELIN Bladder 100 results were presented at the ASCO 2020 Virtual Scientific Meeting.

“As the first immunotherapy to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the first-line setting in locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the FDA approval of avelumab is one of the most significant advances in the treatment paradigm in this setting in 30 years,” said Petros Grivas, M.D., Ph.D., one of the principal investigators in the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial. “With median overall survival of more than 21 months measured from randomization, the longest overall survival in a Phase III trial in advanced urothelial carcinoma, the JAVELIN Bladder 100 regimen with avelumab as a first-line switch maintenance treatment has the potential to become a new standard of care based on its proven ability to reinforce the benefit (response or stable disease) of induction chemotherapy and extend the lives of patients with this devastating disease.”

Platinum-based chemotherapy is currently the first-line standard of care for eligible patients with advanced disease based on high initial response rates. However, most patients will ultimately experience disease progression within nine months of initiation of treatment,3,4 and only 5% of patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis will live longer than five years.5

“Many patients newly diagnosed with advanced urothelial carcinoma receive benefit from initial chemotherapy, but we still need treatment options that can help patients live longer,” said Andrea Maddox-Smith, CEO of the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network. “We wholeheartedly support the development of new and promising treatments like BAVENCIO that can offer patients and their loved ones hope.”

For patients that do not progress on platinum-containing chemotherapy, BAVENCIO is administered as a first-line maintenance treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The FDA previously approved BAVENCIO under the accelerated approval program in 2017 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy, based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval was contingent upon verification of clinical benefit, which was demonstrated in JAVELIN Bladder 100. The FDA has now converted the accelerated approval to full approval.

“Today’s approval of BAVENCIO in the most common type of advanced bladder cancer underscores our commitment to advancing scientific innovation and transforming outcomes for people with genitourinary cancers,” said Andy Schmeltz, Global President, Pfizer Oncology.

“With this approval for BAVENCIO, we have the opportunity to fundamentally shift the standard of care in the first-line setting of advanced bladder cancer. Our focus now is to work closely with the GU community to ensure that this novel and potentially life-changing treatment paradigm is rapidly integrated into clinical practice,” said Rehan Verjee, President, EMD Serono and Global Head of Innovative Medicine Franchises for the Biopharma business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.

The alliance is committed to providing patient access and reimbursement support through its CoverOne® program to patients who have been prescribed BAVENCIO. This program provides a spectrum of patient access and reimbursement support services intended to help US patients prescribed BAVENCIO receive appropriate access.

JAVELIN Bladder 100 (NCT02603432) is a Phase III, multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study investigating first-line maintenance treatment with BAVENCIO plus BSC versus BSC alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC that did not progress with first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy as per RECIST v1.1. A total of 700 patients were randomly assigned to receive either BAVENCIO (10 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 2 weeks) plus BSC (n=350) or BSC alone (n=350). The primary endpoint was OS in the two primary populations of all randomized patients and patients with PD-L1+ tumors defined by the Ventana SP263 assay. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, anti-tumor activity, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, predictive biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes in the two primary populations. All primary and secondary endpoints are measured from the time of randomization, after completion of four to six cycles of chemotherapy. Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were excluded.

In PD-L1+ patients (n=358, 51%), the risk of death was reduced by 44% in the BAVENCIO arm versus the control arm (HR 0.56; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.79; 2-sided p-value <0.001). Consistent results were observed across the pre-specified subgroups of complete or partial response versus stable disease to first-line chemotherapy.1 In an exploratory analysis of patients with PD L1 negative tumors (n=271, 39%), the OS hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.18).

A fatal adverse reaction (sepsis) occurred in one (0.3%) patient receiving BAVENCIO plus BSC. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients receiving BAVENCIO plus BSC. Serious adverse reactions in ≥1% of patients included urinary tract infection (including kidney infection, pyelonephritis, and urosepsis) (6.1%), pain (including abdominal, back, bone, flank, extremity, and pelvic pain) (3.2%), acute kidney injury (1.7%), hematuria (1.5%), sepsis (1.2%), and infusion-related reaction (1.2%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients receiving BAVENCIO plus BSC were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, urinary tract infection, and rash.1

About Urothelial Carcinoma

Bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer worldwide and the sixth most common cancer in the US.5,6 In 2018, there were over half a million new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed, with around 200,000 deaths from the disease globally.6 In the US, an estimated 80,470 cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed in 2019, with around 12,500 locally advanced or metastatic cases presented annually.5,7 UC accounts for about 90% of all bladder cancers.8 UC becomes harder to treat as it advances, spreading through the layers of the bladder wall.9

About BAVENCIO® (avelumab)

BAVENCIO is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. BAVENCIO has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, BAVENCIO has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.10-12 In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize BAVENCIO.

BAVENCIO Approved Indications

BAVENCIO® (avelumab) is indicated in the US for the maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) that has not progressed with first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy. BAVENCIO is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.

BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib is indicated in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

In the US, the FDA granted accelerated approval for BAVENCIO for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

Avelumab is currently approved for patients with MCC in 50 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.

BAVENCIO Important Safety Information from the US FDA-Approved Label

BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and evaluate suspected cases with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis. Pneumonitis occurred in 1.2% of patients, including one (0.1%) patient with fatal, one (0.1%) with Grade 4, and five (0.3%) with Grade 3.

BAVENCIO can cause hepatotoxicity and immune-mediated hepatitis, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) immune-mediated hepatitis until resolution and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred with BAVENCIO as a single agent in 0.9% of patients, including two (0.1%) patients with fatal, and 11 (0.6%) with Grade 3.

BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib can cause hepatotoxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are used as monotherapy. Withhold BAVENCIO and axitinib for moderate (Grade 2) hepatotoxicity and permanently discontinue the combination for severe or life-threatening (Grade 3 or 4) hepatotoxicity. Administer corticosteroids as needed. In patients treated with BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and AST occurred in 9% and 7% of patients, respectively, and immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% of patients, including 4.9% with Grade 3 or 4.
BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold BAVENCIO until resolution for moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) colitis until resolution. Permanently discontinue for life-threatening (Grade 4) or recurrent (Grade 3) colitis upon reinitiation of BAVENCIO. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.5% of patients, including seven (0.4%) with Grade 3.

BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated endocrinopathies, including adrenal insufficiency, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency during and after treatment, and administer corticosteroids as appropriate. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency was reported in 0.5% of patients, including one (0.1%) with Grade 3.
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Manage hypothyroidism with hormone replacement therapy and control hyperthyroidism with medical management. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) thyroid disorders. Thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis, were reported in 6% of patients, including three (0.2%) with Grade 3.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus including diabetic ketoacidosis: Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Withhold BAVENCIO and administer antihyperglycemics or insulin in patients with severe or life-threatening (Grade ≥3) hyperglycemia, and resume treatment when metabolic control is achieved. Type 1 diabetes mellitus without an alternative etiology occurred in 0.1% of patients, including two cases of Grade 3 hyperglycemia.
BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction. Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) nephritis until resolution to Grade 1 or lower. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.1% of patients.

BAVENCIO can result in other severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions involving any organ system during treatment or after treatment discontinuation. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, evaluate to confirm or rule out an immune-mediated adverse reaction and to exclude other causes. Depending on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue BAVENCIO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and initiate hormone replacement therapy, if appropriate. Resume BAVENCIO when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or lower following a corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for any severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of 1738 patients treated with BAVENCIO as a single agent or in 489 patients who received BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib: myocarditis including fatal cases, pancreatitis including fatal cases, myositis, psoriasis, arthritis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, pemphigoid, hypopituitarism, uveitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and systemic inflammatory response.

BAVENCIO can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to the first 4 infusions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 25% of patients, including three (0.2%) patients with Grade 4 and nine (0.5%) with Grade 3.

BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib can cause major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including severe and fatal events. Consider baseline and periodic evaluations of left ventricular ejection fraction. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular events. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue BAVENCIO and axitinib for Grade 3-4 cardiovascular events. MACE occurred in 7% of patients with advanced RCC treated with BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib compared to 3.4% treated with sunitinib. These events included death due to cardiac events (1.4%), Grade 3-4 myocardial infarction (2.8%), and Grade 3-4 congestive heart failure (1.8%).

BAVENCIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus including the risk of fetal death. Advise females of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BAVENCIO and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO. It is not known whether BAVENCIO is excreted in human milk. Advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.

“For physicians, receiving accurate monitoring data and having remote access to programming provides the opportunity to operate with more efficiency and confidence,” said Kenneth Stein, M.D., senior vice president and chief medical officer, Rhythm Management and Global Health Policy, Boston Scientific. “The LUX-Dx ICM System is designed to provide physicians the ability to accelerate critical clinical decisions and allow them to spend more time focusing on patient outcomes by reviewing monitoring data and catching false positive detections without compromising sensitivity.”

The dual-stage algorithm within the LUX-Dx ICM System can be programmed to identify AF, atrial flutter, rhythm pause, bradycardia and tachycardia episodes and allows the device to detect arrhythmias each time established thresholds or parameters are exceeded. An additional level of verification filters is then applied, which was developed to catch false positive detections before an alert is sent. Additionally, after implant, patients are provided with a mobile device preloaded with the MyLUX™ app which connects via Bluetooth® to their ICM device. The app transmits device data daily, or as needed, to the LATITUDE Clarity Data Management System giving physicians and care teams timely access to vital information.

“The LUX-Dx ICM System represents a significant step forward in developing the diagnostic portfolio for Boston Scientific,” said Scott Olson, senior vice president and president, Rhythm Management, Boston Scientific. “The addition of this new offering, alongside existing products and services, affirms our commitment to providing meaningful innovations for the detection and treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias.”

The company will immediately begin a limited market release of the LUX-Dx ICM System in the U.S. with full launch of the product commencing later this year.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–QurAlis Corporation, a biotech company focused on developing precision medicines for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurologic diseases, today announced an agreement to in-license pre-clinical compounds with disease modifying potential in ALS by preventing disease-induced neuronal excitotoxicity from Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly). Financial terms were not disclosed.

“We believe that the compounds we are in-licensing from Lilly have great potential for the development of a targeted ALS therapy, and we intend to advance these compounds to the clinic and to patients in need”

“We believe that the compounds we are in-licensing from Lilly have great potential for the development of a targeted ALS therapy, and we intend to advance these compounds to the clinic and to patients in need,” said Kasper Roet, Ph.D., CEO of QurAlis. “Our ultimate goal has always been to develop clinically meaningful disease modifying medicines for ALS, and this agreement represents a big step in that direction.”

Excitotoxicity in ALS, a defining characteristic of the disease, is caused by the hyperactivity of neurons that leads to the internal buildup of toxic proteins and metabolic waste, and the subsequent death of brain and spinal cord motor neurons. By aiming to prevent neuronal excitability with specifically targeted small molecule drugs, QurAlis’ excitotoxicity research program intends to halt this process and prevent disease progression in those ALS patients, where this disease process plays a prominent role.

“Data from ALS patient-derived stem cell models suggest that excitotoxicity is a major driver of motor neuron degeneration in ALS. The compounds included in this licensing agreement will enable us to target neuronal excitotoxicity in ALS in a novel way,” commented Dan Elbaum, Ph.D., CSO of QurAlis. “We are very encouraged by the signs of activity from early clinical trials on this pathway, which suggest that we may be able to prevent the toxicity to neurons typical of ALS and hopefully modify the course of the disease.”

About ALS

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease impacting nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. ALS breaks down nerve cells, reducing muscle function and causing loss of muscle control. ALS can be traced to mutations in over 25 different genes and is often caused by a combination of multiple sub-forms of the condition. Its average life expectancy is three years, and there is currently no cure for the disease.

About QurAlis Corporation

QurAlis is bringing hope to the ALS community by developing breakthrough precision medicines for this devastating disease. Our stem cell technologies generate proprietary human neuronal models that enable us to more effectively discover and develop innovative therapies for genetically validated targets. We are advancing three antisense and small molecule programs addressing sub-forms of the disease that account for the majority of patients. Together with a world-class network of thought leaders, drug developers and patient advocates, our team is rising to the challenge of conquering ALS. www.quralis.com

35976,Pfizer and BioNTech Report Results of BNT162b1 mRNA-Based Vaccine in P-I/II Study Against COVID-19,PFIZER AND BIONTECH ANNOUNCE EARLY POSITIVE DATA FROM AN ONGOING PHASE 1/2 STUDY OF MRNA-BASED VACCINE CANDIDATE AGAINST SARS-COV-2,"The ongoing P-I/II study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of escalating dose levels of BNT162b1 (10µg & 30µg/ 100 µg) vs PBO in 45 adults aged 18-55yrs.
 Results: @28days (7days after dose 2), neutralizing GMTs (168 & 267) corresponding to 1.8- and 2.8-times GMT of the convalescent serum panel; elevated RBD-binding IgG antibodies with GMCs (4,813 & 27,872 units/ml) which are 8- and 46.3-times, the GMC of 602 units/ml in a panel of 38 sera of convalescent patients who had contracted SARS-CoV-2
 The ongoing P-I/II study of four vaccine candidates will enable selection of a lead candidate and dose level for P-IIb/III study, expected to be initiated in Jul’2020. If vaccine get approval, the companies are expecting to manufacture up to 100M doses by the end of 2020 and more than 1.2B by the end of 2021","In an ongoing U.S. Phase 1/2 placebo-controlled, observer-blinded clinical trial, nucleoside-modified messenger RNA vaccine candidate (BNT162b1) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) is being evaluated in 45 subjects
At day 28 (7 days after dose 2), all subjects who received 10 or 30 µg of BNT162b1 had significantly elevated RBD-binding IgG antibodies with geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of 4,813 and 27,872 units/ml which are 8- and 46.3-times, respectively, the GMC of 602 units/ml in a panel of 38 sera of convalescent patients who had contracted SARS-CoV-2
At day 28 (7 days after dose 2), all subjects who received 10 or 30 µg of BNT162b1 had SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 168 and 267, which are 1.8- and 2.8-times, respectively, the GMT of the convalescent serum panel
Local reactions and systemic events after immunization with 10 µg and 30 µg of BNT162b1 were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient. No serious adverse events were reported
Further data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of four vaccine candidates will enable selection of a lead candidate and dose level for a large, global Phase 2b/3 safety and efficacy study that may begin as early as July 2020
Efforts to manufacture the leading candidates, at risk, are gearing up. In case the safety and efficacy study is successful, and the vaccine receives regulatory approval, the companies are expecting to manufacture up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially more than 1.2 billion doses by the end of 2021
NEW YORK & MAINZ, Germany–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced preliminary data from the most advanced of four investigational vaccine candidates from their BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine program, Project Lightspeed, against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the current global pandemic. The BNT162 program is evaluating at least four experimental vaccines, each of which represents a unique combination of mRNA format and target antigen. The manuscript describing the preliminary clinical data for the nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) candidate, BNT162b1, which encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antigen, is available on an online preprint server at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20142570v1 and is concurrently undergoing scientific peer-review for potential publication. Overall, the preliminary data demonstrated that BNT162b1 could be administered in a dose that was well tolerated and generated dose dependent immunogenicity, as measured by RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers.

“We are encouraged by the clinical data of BNT162b1, one of four mRNA constructs we are evaluating clinically, and for which we have positive, preliminary, topline findings,” said Kathrin U. Jansen, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development, Pfizer. “We are dedicated to develop potentially groundbreaking vaccines and medicines, and in the face of this global health crisis, we approach this goal with the utmost urgency. We look forward to publishing our clinical data in a peer-reviewed journal as quickly as possible.”

“These preliminary data are encouraging in that they provide an initial signal that BNT162b1 targeting the RBD SARS-CoV-2 is able to produce neutralizing antibody responses in humans at or above the levels observed in convalescent sera – and that it does so at relatively low dose levels. We look forward to providing further data updates on BNT162b1,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

The ongoing U.S. Phase 1/2 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of escalating dose levels of BNT162b1. The initial part of the study included 45 healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age. Preliminary data for BNT162b1 was evaluated for 24 subjects who received two injections of 10 µg and 30 µg, 12 subjects who received a single injection of 100 µg, and 9 subjects who received 2 doses of placebo control.

The participants received two doses, 21 days apart, of placebo, 10 µg or 30 µg of BNT162b1, or received a single dose of 100 µg of the vaccine candidate. Because of a strong vaccine booster effect, the highest neutralizing titers were observed seven days after the second dose of 10 µg or 30 µg on day 28 after vaccination. The neutralizing GMTs were 168 and 267 for the 10 µg and 30 µg dose levels, respectively, corresponding to 1.8- and 2.8-times the neutralizing GMT of 94 observed in a panel of 38 sera from subjects who had contracted SARS-CoV-2.

In all 24 subjects who received 2 vaccinations at 10 µg and 30 µg dose levels of BNT162b1, elevation of RBD-binding IgG concentrations was observed after the second injection with respective GMCs of 4,813 and 27,872 units/ml at day 28, seven days after immunization. These concentrations are 8- and 46.3-times the GMC of 602 units/ml in a panel of 38 sera from subjects who had contracted SARS-CoV-2.

At day 21 after a single injection, the 12 subjects who received 100 µg of BNT162b1 had an RBD-binding IgG GMC of 1,778 units/ml and a SARS-CoV neutralizing GMT of 33, which are 3-times and 0.35-times, respectively, the GMC and GMT of the convalescent serum panel.

At the 10 µg or 30 µg dose levels, adverse reactions, including low grade fever, were more common after the second dose than the first dose. Following dose 2, 8.3% of participants who received 10 µg and 75.0% of participants who received 30 µg BNT162b1 reported fever ≥ 38.0 °C. Local reactions and systemic events after injection with 10 µg and 30 µg of BNT162b1 were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient. The most commonly reported local reaction was injection site pain, which was mild to moderate, except in one of 12 subjects who received a 100 µg dose, which was severe. No serious adverse events were reported. Given higher numbers of subjects experiencing local reactions and systemic events after a single 100 µg dose with no significant increases in immunogenicity compared to the 30 µg dose level, the 12 participants in the 100 µg group were not administered a second dose.

These preliminary data, together with additional preclinical and clinical data being generated, will be used by the two companies to determine a dose level and select among multiple vaccine candidates to seek to progress to a large, global Phase 2b/3 safety and efficacy trial. That trial may involve up to 30,000 healthy participants and is anticipated to begin in late July 2020, if regulatory approval to proceed is received. The preliminary clinical data from this ongoing study have been submitted for potential publication in a peer-reviewed journal and is available on an online preprint manuscript server.

The BNT162b1 candidate remains under clinical study and is not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world. If the ongoing studies are successful and the vaccine candidate receives regulatory approval, the companies expect to manufacture up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially more than 1.2 billion doses by the end of 2021. In that event, BioNTech and Pfizer would work jointly to distribute the potential COVID-19 vaccine worldwide (excluding China, where BioNTech has a collaboration with Fosun Pharma for BNT162 for both clinical development and commercialization). The development of the vaccine is also supported by partners like Acuitas Therapeutics. The Canadian company provides lipid nanoparticles (LNP) for the formulation of various mRNA vaccines.

 T-VIVA-19 is a recombinant fusion protein of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain and human IgG Fc (rS1-Fc). The company is planning for clinical trial clearance for the therapy while preparing for large scale manufacturing and commercial distribution in parallel","T-VIVA-19 (targeted virus vaccine against COVID-19) is a recombinant fusion protein of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain and human IgG Fc.
Novel protein to progress as priority vaccine candidate development program.
Sorrento’s existing cGMP manufacturing facility bulk drug substance production capacity estimated able to satisfy up to 100 million doses a month, with on-site scale-up potential to meet additional demand as needed.
SAN DIEGO, July 01, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) announced today that it has published a pre-print publication (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178616v1.full.pdf) describing initial pre-clinical results from its COVID-19 vaccination program, which introduced a novel targeted protein vaccine against COVID-19, referred to as T-VIVA-19.

T-VIVA-19 is a recombinant fusion protein of the spike protein S1-domain and the Fc portion of the human IgG1 antibody (rS1-Fc). The rS1-Fc was injected into either the vein or the thigh muscle of a mouse. The mice were given a booster shot three weeks later (by the same route as the initial injection) and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were examined.

Immunization with the rS1-Fc protein via intramuscular and intravenous injections induced antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 protein in all mice within the first week of administration. Antibodies were observed to be enhanced upon the administration of a booster. Approximately 80% of the mice’s sera possessed neutralizing antibodies and completely prevented virus infection in in vitro cell cultures using 100 TCID50 viruses and VERO cells.

Dr. Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics, said, “If successful and approved, we plan to produce the T-VIVA-19 vaccine in our therapeutic antibody cGMP production facility in San Diego. Due to the potentially low dose administration of T-VIVA-19, which may be one milligram per person or less, we believe our existing cGMP manufacturing facility is capable of producing bulk drug substance rS1-Fc for up to 100 million doses a month. Unlike other vaccine candidates, our rS1-Fc protein production could utilize our existing therapeutic antibody manufacturing processes, and we therefore believe it would be simple and easy to scale up.”

Sorrento plans to take the T-VIVA-19 vaccine candidate through the regulatory steps for clinical trial clearance, while preparing for large scale manufacturing and commercial distribution in parallel.

July 01, 2020 09:22 AM Eastern Daylight Time
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Johnson & Johnson today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted Marketing Authorisation for its Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies’ Ebola vaccine regimen for the prevention of Ebola Virus Disease. Enabled by this approval, Janssen is now collaborating with the World Health Organization (WHO) on vaccine pre-qualification, which should help accelerate registration of its preventive Ebola vaccine regimen in African countries and facilitate broader access to those most in need.

Two Marketing Authorisation Applications (MAAs) were submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the vaccines composing the two-dose regimen, Zabdeno® (Ad26.ZEBOV) and Mvabea® (MVA-BN-Filo). Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances has been granted following Accelerated Assessment of the MAAs and a positive opinion by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Janssen’s Ebola vaccine regimen is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of Ebola Virus Disease caused by the Zaire ebolavirus species in individuals aged one year and above.

“The European approval of Janssen’s Ebola vaccine regimen is a landmark moment – both for our Company and in the world’s battle against the deadly Ebola virus. Building on our history, we are committed to bringing forward vaccines to help overcome the threat of some of the world’s most life-threatening infectious diseases,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer of Johnson & Johnson.

The worst Ebola outbreak to date was the West African epidemic, which caused nearly 30,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths in 2014-2016.1 The world’s second worst Ebola outbreak on record began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), in 2018. It has since caused more than 3,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths – a mortality rate of 65 percent.2

“The approval of our Ebola vaccine symbolizes the progress Janssen has made towards achieving our vision of delivering potentially transformational vaccines to communities most at risk of deadly infectious diseases. Not only is it the first vaccine to emerge from our vaccines pipeline, it is also the first approved vaccine to be developed using Janssen’s AdVac® technology. The same technology is being used to develop vaccine candidates to protect against SARS-CoV-2, as well as Zika, RSV and HIV,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC.

Janssen’s Ebola vaccine regimen is specifically designed to induce long-term immunity against the Ebola virus3,4 in adults and children aged one year and above. As such, it will be used to support preventive vaccination in countries most at risk of outbreaks, as well as for other at-risk groups such as healthcare workers, biosafety level 4 (BSL4) laboratory workers, military personnel deployed in the affected regions, airport staff and visitors to high-risk countries.

The regimen includes Ad26.ZEBOV as the first dose, based on Janssen’s AdVac® viral vector technology,5 and MVA-BN-Filo as the second dose, based on Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN® technology, administered approximately eight weeks later.6

“I am enormously grateful for the dedication from everyone who has been a part of this development, including our many global strategic partners for their extraordinary commitment to helping make this regimen a reality,” said Johan Van Hoof, M.D., Managing Director, Janssen Vaccines and Prevention B.V. “The devastating 2014 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa grew exponentially, overwhelming healthcare systems. In less than six years, with the strength of global public-private collaborations, we have an approved Ebola vaccine which could help those most in need, with the ultimate goal of preventing outbreaks before they start.”

Janssen supported vaccination initiatives in the DRC and neighboring Rwanda, with the goal of preventing Ebola’s geographic spread beyond the outbreak zone. When considering both clinical studies and vaccination initiatives, approximately 60,000 people have been vaccinated with Janssen’s preventive Ebola vaccine regimen to date.7 Janssen-sponsored Phase 1 studies have been reported in peer-reviewed journals including JAMA3,8 and the Journal of Infectious Diseases,9,10 and Phase 1, 2 and 3 data were presented at the 2019 European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Disease (ECCMID).4,6,11 These studies indicate that the vaccine regimen is well tolerated, inducing robust and durable immune responses to the Zaire ebolavirus species. The evaluation of the protective effect of the vaccine regimen was demonstrated through the bridging of clinical immunogenicity results to efficacy and immunogenicity data obtained in non-human primates (NHP).12

In May 2019, the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization recommended the use of the Janssen Ebola vaccine regimen as part of efforts to contain the DRC outbreak13 and more than 50,000 people in the DRC14 and Rwanda15 have been vaccinated to date through this initiative alone.7

Johnson & Johnson has made a significant investment in the Ebola vaccine regimen since its decision to accelerate the development program in 2014 in response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. The Company is grateful to its global strategic partners who have helped to support and co-fund these efforts, including Bavarian Nordic A/S, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) funded through the EU Horizon 2020 program, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Regulatory Submissions & Status
Today’s European Commission Marketing Authorisation decision follows the positive opinion in May 2020 from the CHMP of the EMA16 and the granting of an Accelerated Assessment for Janssen’s investigational preventive Ebola vaccine regimen MAAs by the CHMP in September 2019.17 The MAAs are supported by data from eleven Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies18 evaluating the safety and immunogenicity (ability to induce an immune response) of the vaccine regimen in more than 6,500 adults and children aged one year and above across the U.S., Europe and Africa,18 preclinical studies, and immunobridging analyses comparing the results of clinical and preclinical efficacy studies.

Discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have taken place to define the required data set for filing US licensure.

About Janssen’s Ebola Vaccine Regimen
The Janssen preventive Ebola vaccine regimen, Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo, utilizes a non-replicating viral vector strategy in which viruses – in this case adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) and Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) – are genetically modified so that they cannot replicate in human cells. In addition, these vectors carry the genetic code of several Ebola virus proteins in order to trigger an immune response.

Janssen’s vaccine regimen originates from a collaborative research program with the NIH and received direct funding and preclinical services from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of NIH, under Contract Number HHSN272200800056C. Further funding for the Ebola vaccine regimen has been provided in part with federal funds from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, BARDA under Contract Numbers HHSO100201700013C and HHSO100201500008C.

The IMI provided funding through the IMI Ebola+ Programme to support a number of consortia that initiated multiple clinical trials and other vaccine development activities. The consortia funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 (IMI2) Joint Undertaking are EBOVAC1 (grant nr. 115854), EBOVAC2 (grant nr. 115861), EBOVAC3 (grant nr. 800176), EBOMAN (grant nr. 115850) and EBODAC (grant nr. 115847). This Joint Undertaking receives support from the EU’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).

Johnson & Johnson also acknowledges its many strategic partners in the ongoing global clinical program for the vaccine regimen, including Bavarian Nordic A/S, Centre Muraz, College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences (COMAHS, University of Sierra Leone), Grameen Foundation, Inserm, Inserm Transfert, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), Wellcome Trust, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), University of Antwerp, University of Oxford, Université de Kinshasa (UNIKIN), Vibalogics GmbH, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), World Vision Ireland, The Ministry of Health and Sanitation Sierra Leone, Republic of Rwanda Ministry of Health and the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Public Health and all the people who participated in clinical trials during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the DRC.

36013,"Henlius Reports Positive Results of HLX04 (biosimilar, bevacizumab) in P-III Trial for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer",Phase 3 Trial of Henlius Bevacizumab Biosimilar HLX04 in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Met Study Primary Endpoint,"HLX04 is a biosimilar that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for inhibiting angiogenesis where VEGF acts for promoting growth of blood vessels can inhibit tumor angiogenesis further preventing tumor growth or metastasis. The biosimilar was developed under Chinese biosimilar guideline
 The P-III HLX04-mCRC03 trial involves assessing of HLX04 (biosimilar, bevacizumab) or Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination with oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine-based CT (XELOX or mFOLFOX6) for 1L patients with mCRC and showed bioequivalent to the Avastin in terms of PK and AEs
 The product has also shown bio-similarity in product quality, pharmacology, PK, PD, toxicology and immunogenicity in analytical studies, preclinical studies and P-I clinical study, Presented at Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology","Shanghai, China, 16th June, 2020 – Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) today announced that the HLX04-mCRC03 study has successfully met the predefined primary endpoint. HLX04-mCRC03 is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, multi-centre phase 3 clinical trial comparing the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of HLX04 (bevacizumab biosimilar) or bevacizumab (AvastinⓇ) in combination with oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (XELOX or mFOLFOX6) as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Professor Shukui Qin of No.81 Hospital of People’s Liberation Army and Professor Jin Li of Shanghai East Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Tongji University are co-leading principle investigators (co-PIs) of this study.
Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy in China. There are 388,000 newly diagnosed colorectal cancer cases in 2015 in China[1] and the incidence increases with age. About 290,000 patients die of colorectal cancer per year, making it a big threat to human lives and health. Metastasis happens frequently in colorectal cancers and the majority of patients with colorectal cancer are diagnosed at advanced stages[2]. The most common sites for metastasis are liver, lung and abdominal cavity, among which liver metastasis is most frequently seen. There are about 50% of all mCRC patients suffer from liver metastasis[3]. Currently, surgery and chemotherapy remain the mainstay of mCRC treatment. Clinical studies suggest that combining bevacizumab with chemotherapy can significantly slow the disease progression and prolong survival for mCRC patients; therefore, this combination therapy is the current standard of care for first-line mCRC treatment.
Inhibition on Tumour Angiogenesis of Bevacizumab
HLX04 is a bevacizumab biosimilar independently developed by Henlius in accordance with the Chinese biosimilar guideline. The target indications of HLX04 include mCRC and non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Bevacizumab can specifically bind with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to inhibit tumour angiogenesis[4]. VEGF acts to promote the growth of blood vessels, which is important for wound healing and the maintenance of normal functions. However, VEGF can also activate tumour angiogenesis and thus promote tumour growth. Via blocking the binding of VEGF and its receptor, HLX04 can inhibit tumour angiogenesis and prevent tumour growing or metastasis.
HLX04 is shown to be highly similar to the reference product in product quality, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicology and immunogenicity in analytical studies, preclinical studies and phase 1 clinical study. During the 2018 annual meeting of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO), Henlius has presented the data from the multi-centre, randomized, double-blinded, four-arm parallel Phase 1 clinical pharmacology equivalent study of HLX04. Results from this study showed that HLX04 is bioequivalent to the reference products (AvastinⓇ of United States licensed, European Union approved and China approved) in pharmacokinetics and the incidence of adverse events is also similar to the reference products. These results established a solid foundation for the following Phase 3 study.
Bevacizumab originator has been approved in China for the treatment of mCRC and advanced, metastatic or relapsed non-small-cell lung cancer. Bevacizumab has also been included in the National Reimbursement Drug List in 2017. According to estimated data from IQVIA CHAP™, the sales of bevacizumab in China has reached RMB 2.878 billion in 2019.
Combination Therapy of Henlius’ HLX04 and Anti-PD-1 mAb HLX10
In addition, Henlius innovatively explores the regimen of HLX04 combined with Henlius own anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) HLX10, leading the immune-oncology mAb combination therapy in China. HLX10 combined with HLX04 for the treatment of advanced solid tumour is the first domestic mAb combination therapy approved for clinical trials in China. Henlius has successfully initiated the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (HLX10-002-NSCLC301; NCT03952403) of this combination therapy as first-line treatment in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. It is a three-arm, randomized, double-blind, multi-centre Phase 3 trial, aiming to compare the efficacy and safety of HLX10 in combination with chemotherapy, HLX10 + HLX04 in combination with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone. At the same time, the clinical trial of the combination of HLX10 and HLX04 as second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma has also been initiated. It is a single-arm, open labelled, multi-centre Phase 2 clinical trial, aiming to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of HLX10 combined with HLX04 for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have progressed after standard treatment or are intolerable to standard treatment. There are few studies exploring the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with anti-angiogenesis mAbs in this indication in China and Henlius is currently leading in progressions in clinical studies in this area.
Henlius will continue developing a diversified in-house combination therapy portfolio with a focus on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs. The HLX10 combination therapies covering lung cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, oesophagus cancer, head and neck cancer and cervical cancer. Henlius also actively advancing the discovery and development of innovative biologics. Looking forward, Henlius will further concreting its leading position in biosimilar and innovative biologics in China and keep its long-term commitment to providing affordable and effective therapies for patients worldwide.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/henlius-3.jpg,Biosimilars|Clinical Trials|Regulatory,Henlius,HLX04 | bevacizumab,Colorectal Cancer |Biosimilar|Clinical Trials |Regulatory |Metastatic | P-III|Positive|reports|results|Trial,publish,16/6/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/phase-3-trial-of-henlius-bevacizumab-biosimilar-hlx04-in-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-met-study-primary-endpoint/,https://pharmashots.com/36013/henlius-reports-positive-results-of-hlx04-biosimilar-bevacizumab-in-p-iii-trial-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer/

About Adalimumab

Adalimumab is an injectable, biologic medication which inhibits Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF). TNF can cause inflammation in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. By specifically binding to TNF, adalimumab blocks its activity, thereby reducing inflammation and other disease symptoms.

36032,Biogen Signs a License Agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear to Develop Treatment for Inherited Retinal Disorder,Massachusetts Eye and Ear Enters Licensing Agreement with Biogen to Develop Treatment for Inherited Retinal Disorder,"Biogen will receive an exclusive license to develop the product worldwide and will be responsible for all US FDA required IND enabling studies, clinical development, and commercialization
 The companies collaborated to develop a therapy for IRDs due to mutations in the PRPF31 gene. Research performed at Harvard Ophthalmology demonstrated that AAV-mediated gene augmentation therapy for PRPF31 can restore normal function to mutant RPE cells
 The agreement emphasizes Biogen’s commitment to the acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics in 2019 and its active clinical trials targeting different genetic forms of IRD. Biogen will leverage its pre/ clinical experience to PRPF31 program","Newswise — Massachusetts Eye and Ear, a member hospital of Mass General Brigham, is entering into an exclusive licensing agreement with Biogen to develop a potential treatment for inherited retinal degeneration due to mutations in the PRPF31 gene, which are among the most common causes for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.

Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs), such as retinitis pigmentosa, are a group of blinding eye diseases caused by mutations in over 270 different genes. Mutations in the PRPF31 gene are the second most common cause of dominant IRD and lead to defects in the function of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and photoreceptors of the retina. Previous lab-based research performed by members of the Ocular Genomics Institute at Harvard Ophthalmology, led by Eric A. Pierce, MD, PhD, demonstrated that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene augmentation therapy for PRPF31 can restore normal function to PRPF31 mutant RPE cells.

Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB), a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and delivers worldwide innovative therapies for people living with serious neurological and neurodegenerative diseases as well as related therapeutic adjacencies, will build upon this prior work, and conduct the studies needed for clinical development of PRPF31 gene therapy. This includes the pre-clinical studies needed to support progression to clinical trials of PRPF31 gene therapy. As part of the agreement, Biogen will receive an exclusive license to develop the product worldwide and will be responsible for all U.S. Food and Drug-Administration (FDA) required investigational new drug (IND) enabling studies, clinical development and commercialization.

“The treatment of IRDs with highly effective AAV-based gene therapies is core to Biogen’s ophthalmology strategy,” said Chris Henderson, Head of Research, Biogen. “This agreement underscores our commitment to that strategy and builds off of our acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics in 2019 and our active clinical trials of gene therapies for different genetic forms of IRD. We are excited to work with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and look forward to applying our preclinical and clinical experience to their leading PRPF31 program.”

“We are thrilled to work with Biogen, who will bring to this effort its deep experience with the clinical development process, as we work toward our goal of developing a gene therapy for people with PRPF31-related eye disease,” added Dr. Pierce, who is the William F. Chatlos Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. “My ultimate hope for patients with inherited retinal disorders due to mutations in PRPF31 is that a gene therapy will preserve and potentially restore some of their vision.”

About the Ocular Genomics Institute

The Ocular Genomics Institute at Harvard Ophthalmology aims to translate genomic medicine into precision ophthalmic care for patients with inherited eye disorders. It is home to one of the leading centers for early-phase clinical trials of therapies for inherited retinal degenerations, with seven gene-based and one stem cell trial currently in progress. The group works in conjunction with other departments throughout Harvard Medical School and Mass. Eye and Ear, including the Bioinformatics Center and Grousbeck Gene Therapy Center.

Dr. Pierce’s lab, established in 2011, is dedicated to research in an effort to improve the understanding of the molecular bases of IRDs so that rational therapies can be developed for these diseases.

In 2018, Mass. Eye and Ear surgeons performed the first post-FDA approval gene therapy for patients with a form of inherited retinal blindness caused by mutations in the gene RPE65 by injecting an AAV-based drug treatment into a patient’s eye, which restored vision in a 13-year-old boy. This therapy, called Luxturna, is now being used to treat patients with RPE65-associated retinal degeneration around the world.

“One of the exciting aspects of our collaboration with Biogen is that mutations in the PRPF31 gene affect approximately 10 to 20 times more people than mutations in the RPE65 gene,” said Dr. Pierce. “Success with PRPF31 gene therapy could provide visual benefit to more patients, which is our ultimate goal.”

“Mass. Eye and Ear was one of the first centers to offer life-changing gene therapies to patients with inherited retinal disease, and we are thrilled with this new opportunity to develop a translational retinal therapy that could help even more patients,” said Joan W. Miller, MD, Chief of Ophthalmology at Mass. Eye and Ear, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Chair of Ophthalmology and the David Glendenning Cogan Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School.

According to Chris Coburn, Chief Innovation Officer, Mass General Brigham, the collaboration with Biogen illustrates the importance of academia and industry teaming to solve problems for patients worldwide. “We are eager to see this progress reach patients who are challenged by blinding, degenerative eye disease,” said Coburn. “We look forward to working with Biogen to advance this break-through innovation.”

Patients with an inherited retinal disease require genetic testing prior to being considered for any gene therapy treatment.

(Nasdaq: MEIP), a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on advancing potential new therapies for cancer, today announce that an interim futility analysis of the ongoing Phase 3 study of pracinostat in combination with azacitidine in patients with AML who are unfit to receive standard intensive chemotherapy, undertaken by the study Independent Data Monitoring Committee (“IDMC”), has demonstrated it was unlikely to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival compared to the control group. Based on the outcome of the interim analysis, the decision was made to discontinue the recruitment of patients and end the study. The decision was based on a lack of efficacy and not on safety concerns. Pending further evaluation, patients currently enrolled in other pracinostat studies will continue treatment.

About AML

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a disorder of the blood and bone marrow caused by the uncontrolled proliferation of an abnormal hematopoietic cell of myeloid lineage. This results in a high circulating number of immature blood cells and replacement of normal bone marrow by malignant cells. AML has various subtypes, which are based on the type of cell from which the leukemia developed. It is typically a disease of older patients, with a median age at diagnosis of 67 years. Whilst the cure rate with intensive chemotherapy for AML patients who are 60 or younger is 35 to 40%, the rate is poor in older patients, typically not exceeding 15%.

About Pracinostat

Pracinostat is an oral histone deacetylase (“HDAC”) inhibitor that is being investigated in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) who are unfit for standard intensive chemotherapy. It is also being evaluated in a Phase II study in patients with high or very high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted Orphan Drug Designation for pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AML who are ≥75 years of age or unfit for intensive chemotherapy. In addition, the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to the combination treatment.

In August 2016, Helsinn and MEI Pharma entered an exclusive license, development and commercialization agreement for pracinostat in AML and other potential indications. The agreement provides that Helsinn is primarily responsible for development and commercialization costs for pracinostat in AML and other indications, including MDS.

Pracinostat is an investigational agent and is not approved for commercial use in the U.S. or any other country worldwide.

 Sarepta get an exclusive WW license to develop and promote imlifidase as a pre-treatment for gene therapy in DMD & LGDM patients who have pre-existing antibodies to AAV
 Imlifidase is an Ab-cleaving enzyme targeting IgG, inhibits an IgG-mediated immune response and has rapid onset of action within hours after administration, thus clearing the AAV-IgG Abs typically preclude dosing or re-dosing with AAV","— Exclusive worldwide license enables Sarepta to develop and promote imlifidase as a pre-treatment for gene therapy in Duchenne and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy patients who have pre-existing antibodies to AAV —

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., July 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, today announced an agreement with Hansa Biopharma, the leader in immunomodulatory enzyme technology for rare Immunoglobulin G (IgG) mediated diseases, for imlifidase. Under the terms of the agreement, Sarepta obtains an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and promote imlifidase as a pre-treatment to enable Sarepta gene therapy administration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), for patients who may otherwise not be eligible for treatment.

Sarepta’s investigational gene therapies use an adeno-associated virus (AAV) and patients with Duchenne and LGMD who have pre-existing IgG antibodies are not currently eligible for treatment with any AAV-based gene therapies. Imlifidase is an antibody-cleaving enzyme that specifically targets IgG and inhibits an IgG-mediated immune response. Imlifidase has a rapid onset of action, cleaving IgG-antibodies and inhibiting their reactivity within hours after administration, thus clearing the AAV-IgG antibodies that would typically preclude dosing or re-dosing with AAV.

“As we expand our leadership position in genetic medicine and build out our gene therapy engine, one of Sarepta’s central ambitions is to find scientific solutions that bring our potentially life-saving therapies to the greatest number of the rare disease patients we serve,” said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive officer, Sarepta Therapeutics. “One of the current limitations of gene therapy is the inability to treat patients who have pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to the AAV vector. While our AAVrh74 vector has been associated with a low screen out rate for neutralizing antibodies, even that low rate is inconsistent with our mission. In pre-clinical and clinical models, Hansa’s technology has shown the ability to clear the IgG antibodies that prevent dosing AAV-based gene therapies. If successful, this could offer the potential of extending our gene therapy treatments to DMD and LGMD patients who would otherwise have been denied access due to pre-existing antibodies.”

“We see significant potential for our enzyme technology in the gene therapy space overall, and we are excited to partner with Sarepta, a leading player in the field, to use the unique features of imlifidase to potentially enable gene therapy treatment in patients who today aren’t eligible for these breakthrough therapies due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in two conditions with a very high unmet medical need,” said Søren Tulstrup, president and chief executive officer, Hansa Biopharma.

Under the terms of the agreement, Hansa will receive an upfront payment of $10 million and is eligible for additional development, regulatory and sales milestone payments potentially totaling up to $397.5 million. Hansa will book all sales of imlifidase and will earn tiered royalties up to the mid-teens on any incremental gene therapy sales that arise from treating antibody-positive patients enabled through imlifidase pre-treatment.

About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
(DMD) is a rare, fatal neuromuscular genetic disease that occurs in approximately one in every 3,500-5,000 males worldwide. DMD is caused by a change or mutation in the gene that encodes instructions for dystrophin. Symptoms of DMD usually appear in infants and toddlers. Affected children may experience developmental delays such as difficulty in walking, climbing stairs or standing from a sitting position. As the disease progresses, muscle weakness in the lower limbs spreads to the arms, neck and other areas. Most patients require full-time use of a wheelchair in their early teens, and then progressively lose the ability to independently perform activities of daily living such as using the restroom, bathing and feeding. Eventually, increasing difficulty in breathing due to respiratory muscle dysfunction requires ventilation support, and cardiac dysfunction can lead to heart failure. The condition is universally fatal, and patients usually succumb to the disease in their twenties.

About Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy
Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases that cause progressive, debilitating weakness and wasting that begin in muscles around the hips and shoulders before progressing to muscles in the arms and legs.

Patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2E (LGMD2E) begin showing neuromuscular symptoms such as difficulty running, jumping and climbing stairs before age 10. The disease, which is an autosomal recessive subtype of LGMD, progresses to loss of ambulation in the teen years and often leads to early mortality. There is currently no treatment or cure for LGMD2E.

Sarepta has five LGMD gene therapy programs in development, including subtypes for LGMD2E, LGMD2D, LGMD2C, LGMD2B and LGMD2L, and holds an option for a sixth program for LGMD2A.

36111,Sanofi and Regeneron's Kevzara (sarilumab) Fails in P-III Trial for Patients with COVID-19 in the US,Sanofi and Regeneron provide update on Kevzara (sarilumab) Phase 3 U.S. trial in COVID-19 patients,"The P-III study assessing Kevzara (400mg) + BSC vs BSC in 194 patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation did not meet it’s 1EPs & 2EPs
 Based on the results, the companies have stopped the US-based study that includes the second cohort of patients receiving a higher dose of Kevzara (800 mg)
 The IDMC is managing both the Regeneron-led US trial and the Sanofi-led trial outside of the US and has recommended that the trial outside the US using a different dosing regimen should continue with its anticipated results in Q3’20","PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – July 2, 2020 – Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Phase 3 trial of Kevzara® (sarilumab) 400 mg in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation did not meet its primary and key secondary endpoints when Kevzara was added to best supportive care compared to best supportive care alone (placebo).

Minor positive trends were observed in the primary pre-specified analysis group (critical patients on Kevzara 400 mg who were mechanically ventilated at baseline) that did not reach statistical significance and these were countered by negative trends in a subgroup of critical patients who were not mechanically ventilated at baseline1. In the primary analysis group, adverse events were experienced by 80% of Kevzara patients and 77% of placebo patients. Serious adverse events that occurred in at least 3% of patients and more frequently among Kevzara patients were multi organ dysfunction syndrome (6% Kevzara, 5% placebo) and hypotension (4% Kevzara, 3% placebo).

Based on the results, the U.S.-based trial has been stopped, including in a second cohort of patients who received a higher dose of Kevzara (800 mg). Detailed results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication later this year.

The primary analysis group included 194 patients who were critically ill with COVID-19 and receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of enrolment. The primary endpoint assessed the percentage of patients who achieved at least a 1-point change from baseline on a 7-point scale, which consisted of 1) death; 2) hospitalized, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) hospitalized, requiring non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen – requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 6) hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen – no longer requires ongoing medical care; 7) discharged from hospital. A second cohort, which was partially recruited (n=27), compared Kevzara 800 mg versus placebo.

The Kevzara trial was designed after a small (n=21), single-arm study in China (Xu et al) among mostly severe, febrile hospitalized COVID-19 patients found elevated IL-6 levels and suggested that inhibiting this pathway with the IL-6 blocker tocilizumab rapidly reduced fever and improved oxygenation in severe patients, allowing for successful hospital discharge. The Phase 3 Kevzara trial was designed to evaluate this hypothesis in a large, placebo-controlled trial. The trial has been funded in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

A separate Sanofi-led trial outside of the U.S. in hospitalized patients with severe and critical COVID-19 using a different dosing regimen is ongoing. The same Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) is overseeing both the Regeneron-led U.S. trial and the Sanofi-led trial outside of U.S., which has recommended that the trial outside of the U.S. continue. The companies expect to report results in Q3 2020.

1: Endpoints that showed positive trends in patients on mechanical ventilation at baseline, and were countered by negative trends in patients who were not mechanically ventilated at baseline included: the proportion of patients with a 1-point improvement on day 22 (primary endpoint for mechanical ventilation group); the proportion of patients who died by day 29; and proportion of patients who recovered by day 22.

About Kevzara® (sarilumab) Injection
Kevzara is currently approved in multiple countries to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded to or tolerated previous therapy.

Kevzara binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is an immune system protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity, joint destruction and other systemic problems. Kevzara is being investigated for its ability to reduce the overactive inflammatory immune response associated with COVID-19 based on evidence of markedly elevated levels of IL-6 in critically ill patients infected with coronaviruses.

In its preclinical study, the vaccine demonstrated that it is capable to neutralize the wild type virus in the virus neutralization assay
 In its toxicology studies, the vaccine is found to be safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic
 Zydus has manufactured clinical GMP batches of the vaccine with the expected initiation of clinical trials in Jul’2020 across multiple sites in India in over 1000 subjects. Additionally, the company will ramp up the production capacities of ZyCoV-D at multiple sites to meet the global demand"," The vaccine is found to be immunogenic in multiple animal species.
 Antibodies produced in animal studies are able to completely neutralize the wild type virus
 Preclinical toxicity studies find the vaccine to be well tolerated, safe and immunogenic
 The Company plans to start the human clinical trials in July 2020.
Ahmedabad, India, 03 July, 2020
Zydus an innovation-driven, global pharmaceutical company, announced that it’s plasmid DNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19 (ZyCoV-D) developed indigenously at its Vaccine Technology Centre in Ahmedabad, India has successfully completed the preclinical phase and has now received permission from the Drug Controller General of India – Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to initiate Phase I/II human clinical trials in India.
In animal studies the vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response in multiple animal species like mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. The antibodies produced by the vaccine were able to completely neutralize the wild type virus in virus neutralization assay indicating the protective potential of the vaccine candidate. No safety concerns were observed for the vaccine candidate in repeat dose toxicology studies by both intramuscular and intradermal routes of administration. In rabbits, up to three times the intended human dose was found to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic.
Zydus has already manufactured clinical GMP batches of the vaccine candidate and plans to initiate the clinical trials in July 2020 across multiple sites in India in over 1000 subjects.
With ZyCoV-D, the Company has successfully established the DNA vaccine platform in the country using non-replicating and non-integrating plasmid carrying the gene of interest making it very safe. Further, no vector response and with absence of any infectious agent, the platform provides ease of manufacturing the vaccine with minimal biosafety requirements (BSL-1). The platform is also known to show much improved vaccine stability and lower cold chain requirements making it easy for transportation to remotest regions of the country. Furthermore, the platform can be rapidly used to modify the vaccine in couple of weeks in case the virus mutates to ensure that the vaccine still elicits protection.
Company intends to now rapidly ramp up the production capacities of ZyCoV-D at multiple sites and facilities to cater to Indian and global demand.
Zydus’ Vaccine research programme
Vaccine Technology Centre of Zydus Cadila has wide range of capabilities in developing and manufacturing viral, toxoid, polysaccharide, conjugate and other subunit vaccines for unmet needs.

36139,ViiV Healthcare's Rukobia (fostemsavir) Receives the US FDA's Approval for HIV in Patients with Limited Treatment Options,"ViiV Healthcare announces US FDA approval for Rukobia (fostemsavir), a first-in-class treatment for HIV in adults with few treatment options available","The approval is based on P-III BRIGHTE study assessing Rukobia (600mg, ER) + OBT in 371 HTE adults living with multidrug-resistant HIV. Participants were enrolled in either a randomized or nonrandomized cohort
 In the randomized cohort, 60% adults achieved undetectable HIV viral load and clinically meaningful improvements to CD4+ T-cell count @96wks., HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL @24 & 96wks. (53% & 60%); changes in CD4+ cell count (90 & 205 cells/mm3) respectively
 In the nonrandomized cohort, 37% achieved HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL @24 & 96wks.; HIV-1 RNA <200 copies/mL (42% & 39%); mean changes in CD4+ cell count (41 & 119 cells/mm3) respectively. Fostemsavir is a first-in-class HIV-1 attachment inhibitor, currently under EMA’s review with additional submissions to regulatory authorities anticipated in 2020 & 2021","For media and investors only

Issued: London, UK

In a phase III study, a majority (60%) of heavily treatment-experienced adults randomized to receive Rukobia with an optimized background therapy achieved and maintained viral suppression through 96 weeks, addressing a critical unmet need

ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Rukobia (fostemsavir), 600 mg extended-release tablets. Rukobia is a novel attachment inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1 infection indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) therapies in heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection, who are failing their current ARV regimen due to resistance, intolerance or safety considerations.

Significant advances over the past few decades have dramatically improved HIV treatment and for many, HIV is considered a manageable life-long condition. However, HTE adults – which account for approximately 6% of adults living with HIV who are on treatment – have little to no options left due to resistance, tolerability or safety considerations.1 HTE adults are at risk of progressing to AIDS and death and in great need of additional therapies.

Deborah Waterhouse, CEO of ViiV Healthcare, said: “There is a small group of heavily treatment-experienced adults living with HIV who are not able to maintain viral suppression with currently available medication and, without effective new options, are at great risk of progressing to AIDS. The approval of Rukobia is a culmination of incredibly complex research, development, and manufacturing efforts to ensure we leave no person living with HIV behind.”

The approval was supported by data from the phase III BRIGHTE study, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Rukobia in combination with optimized background therapy (OBT) in HTE adults living with multidrug-resistant HIV, many of whom had advanced HIV disease at study entry. In the randomized cohort, 60% (n=163/272) of individuals who received Rukobia in addition to an investigator-selected OBT achieved undetectable HIV viral load and clinically meaningful improvements to CD4+ T-cell count through Week 96.

The proportion of participants who discontinued treatment with Rukobia due to an adverse event was 7% at Week 96 (randomized: 5% and nonrandomized: 12%). The most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in ≥5% of randomized and nonrandomized participants were nausea, fatigue and diarrhea. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were related to infections (3%). Serious drug reactions occurred in 3% of people taking Rukobia and included three cases of severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.2

Jacob P. Lalezari, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and Director of Quest Clinical Research, said: “As a novel HIV attachment inhibitor, fostemsavir targets the first step of the viral lifecycle offering a new mechanism of action to treat people living with HIV. In the BRIGHTE study, fostemsavir in combination with other ARVs effectively achieved and maintained long-term viral suppression and demonstrated clinically meaningful rise in CD4+ T-cell count even among heavily immunocompromised patients. These are exciting advances for the HTE population and an advancement the HIV community has long been waiting for. As an activist as well as researcher, I am very grateful to ViiV Healthcare for their commitment to heavily-treatment experienced people living with HIV.”

Rukobia was reviewed and approved under the FDA’s Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations which are intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition.

Gabriel Maldonado, Founder and CEO, TruEvolution, Inc., said: “Some members of the HIV community face very challenging treatment journeys and do not respond to available therapies for a variety of reasons. The approval of fostemsavir provides a sense of renewed hope for these adults who have few or no viable treatment options left and have been awaiting alternative medicines to control the virus.”

Fostemsavir is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency and additional submissions to regulatory authorities around the world are planned throughout 2020 and 2021.

About BRIGHTE
The BRIGHTE trial is an international, phase III, partially-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 371 HTE adults living with HIV-1 infection with multidrug resistance. All trial participants were required to have a viral load ≥400 copies/mL and ≤2 classes of antiretroviral medications remaining at baseline due to resistance, intolerability, contraindication, or other safety considerations. Trial participants were enrolled in either a randomized or nonrandomized cohort defined as follows:

Within the randomized cohort (n = 272), participants had 1, but no more than 2, fully active and available antiretroviral agent(s) at screening which could be combined as part of an efficacious background regimen. Randomized participants received either blinded fostemsavir 600 mg twice daily (n = 203) or placebo (n = 69) in addition to their current failing regimen for 8 days of functional monotherapy. Beyond Day 8, randomized participants received open-label fostemsavir 600 mg twice daily plus an investigator-selected optimized background therapy (OBT).
Within the nonrandomized cohort (n = 99), participants had no fully active and approved antiretroviral agent(s) available at screening. Nonrandomized participants were treated with open-label fostemsavir 600 mg twice daily plus OBT from Day 1 onward. The use of an investigational drug(s) as a component of the optimised background therapy was permitted in the nonrandomized cohort.
The primary endpoint analysis, based on the adjusted mean decline in HIV-1 RNA from Day 1 at Day 8 in the randomized cohort, demonstrated superiority of fostemsavir to placebo (0.79 vs. 0.17 log10 copies/mL decline, respectively; P<0.0001, Intent-to-Treat-Exposed [ITT-E] population). In the randomized cohort, HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL was achieved in 53% and 60% of subjects at Weeks 24 and 96, respectively (ITT-E, Snapshot algorithm). Mean changes in CD4+ cell count from baseline continued to increase over time (i.e., 90 cells/mm3 at Week 24 and 205 cells/mm3 at Week 96). The most common adverse reaction (all grades) observed in ≥5% of participants were nausea. The proportion of participants who discontinued treatment with fostemsavir due to an adverse event was 7% at Week 96 (randomized: 5% and nonrandomized: 12%). In the nonrandomized cohort, HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL was achieved in 37% of subjects at Weeks 24 and 96. At these timepoints, the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <200 copies/mL was 42% and 39%, respectively (ITT-E, Snapshot algorithm). Mean changes in CD4+ cell count from baseline increased over time: 41 cells/mm3 at Week 24 and 119 cells/mm3 at Week 96. The most common adverse reactions reported in nonrandomized subjects were fatigue (7%), nausea (6%), and diarrhea (6%).

About Rukobia
The active ingredient in Rukobia is fostemsavir. Fostemsavir is a first-in-class HIV-1 attachment inhibitor. After oral administration, fostemsavir is converted to temsavir, which is then absorbed and exerts antiviral activity by attaching directly to the glycoprotein 120 (gp120) subunit on the surface of the virus, thereby blocking HIV from attaching to host immune system CD4+ T-cells and preventing the virus from infecting those cells and multiplying. As Rukobia is the first antiretroviral therapy to target this step of the viral cycle, there is no demonstrated resistance to other classes of antiretrovirals, which may help patients who have become resistant to most other medicines.

This designation can give access to several incentives, including protocol assistance, the EU centralized authorization procedure and reduced regulatory fees and a potential for a 10-year market exclusivity in the EU.

About hepatocellular carcinoma

HCC represents the fifth most common cancer worldwide but is a rare disease in Europe and the US. Although therapies exist, treatment benefits for intermediate and advanced HCC are low and death rates remain high. HCC is a very diverse disease with multiple cancer cell types and without the tumor-specific mutations. This has contributed to the lack of success of molecularly targeted agents in HCC. The limited overall benefit, taken together with the poor overall prognosis for patients with intermediate and advanced HCC, results in a large unmet medical need.

About MIV-818

MIV-818 is a pro-drug designed to selectively treat liver cancer cells and to minimize side effects. It has the potential to become the first liver-targeted, orally administered drug for patients with HCC.

About Coronavirus Disease 2019
CytoDyn has met its 75-patient enrollment target in its Phase 2 clinical trial for COVID-19, a randomized clinical trial for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 population in the U.S. and enrollment continues in its Phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial for severe and critically ill COVID-19 population in several hospitals throughout the country.

SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 disease is uncertain, and the virus is highly contagious. COVID-19 typically transmits person to person through respiratory droplets, commonly resulting from coughing, sneezing, and close personal contact. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals. For confirmed COVID-19 infections, symptoms have included fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. Clinical manifestations in patients have ranged from non-existent to severe and fatal. At this time, there are minimal treatment options for COVID-19.

About Leronlimab (PRO 140) and BLA Submission for the HIV Combination Therapy
The FDA has granted a Fast Track designation to CytoDyn for two potential indications of leronlimab for deadly diseases. The first as a combination therapy with HAART for HIV-infected patients and the second is for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Leronlimab is an investigational humanized IgG4 mAb that blocks CCR5, a cellular receptor that is important in HIV infection, tumor metastases, and other diseases, including NASH. Leronlimab has completed nine clinical trials in over 800 people, including meeting its primary endpoints in a pivotal Phase 3 trial (leronlimab in combination with standard antiretroviral therapies in HIV-infected treatment-experienced patients).

In the setting of HIV/AIDS, leronlimab is a viral-entry inhibitor; it masks CCR5, thus protecting healthy T cells from viral infection by blocking the predominant HIV (R5) subtype from entering those cells. Leronlimab has been the subject of nine clinical trials, each of which demonstrated that leronlimab could significantly reduce or control HIV viral load in humans. The leronlimab antibody appears to be a powerful antiviral agent leading to potentially fewer side effects and less frequent dosing requirements compared with daily drug therapies currently in use.

The Company filed its BLA for Leronlimab as a Combination Therapy for Highly Treatment Experienced HIV Patients with the FDA on April 27, 2020, and submitted additional FDA requested clinical datasets on May 11, 2020. After the FDA deems a BLA submission complete, it sets a PDUFA goal date. CytoDyn has Fast Track designation for leronlimab and a rolling review for its BLA, as previously assigned by the FDA. The Company filed a request for Priority Review designation for its BLA to shorten the FDA’s review time from 10 to 6 months, an FDA goal for BLA applications given Priority Review designation.

In the setting of cancer, research has shown that CCR5 may play a role in tumor invasion, metastases, and tumor microenvironment control. Increased CCR5 expression is an indicator of disease status in several cancers. Published studies have shown that blocking CCR5 can reduce tumor metastases in laboratory and animal models of aggressive breast and prostate cancer. Leronlimab reduced human breast cancer metastasis by more than 98% in a murine xenograft model. CytoDyn is, therefore, conducting a Phase 1b/2 human clinical trial in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and was granted Fast Track designation in May 2019.

The CCR5 receptor appears to play a central role in modulating immune cell trafficking to sites of inflammation. It may be crucial in the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and other inflammatory conditions. Clinical studies by others further support the concept that blocking CCR5 using a chemical inhibitor can reduce the clinical impact of acute GvHD without significantly affecting the engraftment of transplanted bone marrow stem cells. CytoDyn is currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical study with leronlimab to support further the concept that the CCR5 receptor on engrafted cells is critical for the development of acute GvHD, blocking the CCR5 receptor from recognizing specific immune signaling molecules is a viable approach to mitigating acute GvHD. The FDA has granted “orphan drug” designation to leronlimab for the prevention of GvHD.

About CytoDyn
CytoDyn is a late-stage biotechnology company developing innovative treatments for multiple therapeutic indications based on leronlimab, a novel humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CCR5 receptor. CCR5 appears to play a critical role in the ability of HIV to enter and infect healthy T-cells. The CCR5 receptor also appears to be implicated in tumor metastasis and immune-mediated illnesses, such as GvHD and NASH. CytoDyn has successfully completed a Phase 3 pivotal trial with leronlimab in combination with standard antiretroviral therapies in HIV-infected treatment-experienced patients. CytoDyn filed its BLA in April 2020 to seek FDA approval for leronlimab as a combination therapy for highly treatment experienced HIV patients, and submitted additional FDA requested clinical datasets on May 11, 2020. CytoDyn is also conducting a Phase 3 investigative trial with leronlimab as a once-weekly monotherapy for HIV-infected patients. CytoDyn plans to initiate a registration-directed study of leronlimab monotherapy indication. If successful, it could support a label extension. Clinical results to date from multiple trials have shown that leronlimab can significantly reduce viral burden in people infected with HIV. No drug-related serious site injection reactions reported in about 800 patients treated with leronlimab and no drug-related SAEs reported in patients treated with 700 mg dose of leronlimab. Moreover, a Phase 2b clinical trial demonstrated that leronlimab monotherapy can prevent viral escape in HIV-infected patients; some patients on leronlimab monotherapy have remained virally suppressed for more than five years. CytoDyn is also conducting a Phase 2 trial to evaluate leronlimab for the prevention of GvHD and a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial with leronlimab in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

36190,Regeneron with its Partner NIAID Report the Initiation of P-III Trial to Evaluate REGN-COV2 for Treatment and Prevention of COVID-19,Regeneron Announces Start of REGN-COV2 Phase 3 COVID-19 Prevention Trial in Collaboration with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),"The P-III trial involves assessing REGN-COV2 with an expected enrollment of 2000 patients at 100 sites which will be evaluated to prevent infection among uninfected people who have had close exposure to a COVID-19 patient
 REGN-COV2 is also being evaluated in P-II/III portion of two P-I/II/III trials testing the cocktail’s ability to treat hospitalized (N= 1,850) and non-hospitalized (N=1050) patients with COVID-19 across 150 sites in the US, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile with expected results in late summer. Additionally, clinical progress follows positive recommendations from IDMC of P-I trial which involved assessing of REGN-COV2 in 30 hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 
 REGN-COV2 is double-antibody cocktail developed using VelociMab and manufacturing capabilities for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19","Anti-viral antibody cocktail REGN-COV2 is also in Phase 2/3 treatment trials following positive Phase 1 safety review.

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., July 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the initiation of late-stage clinical trials evaluating REGN-COV2, Regeneron’s investigational double antibody cocktail for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. A Phase 3 trial will evaluate REGN-COV2’s ability to prevent infection among uninfected people who have had close exposure to a COVID-19 patient (such as the patient’s housemate), and is being run jointly with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). REGN-COV2 has also moved into the Phase 2/3 portion of two adaptive Phase 1/2/3 trials testing the cocktail’s ability to treat hospitalized and non-hospitalized (or “ambulatory”) patients with COVID-19.

This clinical progress follows a positive review from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee of REGN-COV2 Phase 1 safety results in an initial cohort of 30 hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

The Phase 3 prevention trial is being conducted at approximately 100 sites and is expected to enroll 2,000 patients in the U.S.; the trial will assess SARS-CoV-2 infection status. The two Phase 2/3 treatment trials in hospitalized (estimated enrollment =1,850) and non-hospitalized (estimated enrollment =1,050) patients are planned to be conducted at approximately 150 sites in the U.S., Brazil, Mexico and Chile, and will evaluate virologic and clinical endpoints, with preliminary data expected later this summer. All trials are adaptively-designed, and the ultimate numbers of patients enrolled will depend on trial progress and insights from Phase 2 studies.

“We are running simultaneous adaptive trials in order to move as quickly as possible to provide a potential solution to prevent and treat COVID-19 infections, even in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “We are pleased to collaborate with NIAID to study REGN-COV2 in our quest to further prevent the spread of the virus with an anti-viral antibody cocktail that could be available much sooner than a vaccine.”

About REGN-COV2
Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company’s proprietary VelocImmune® mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies isolated from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. They selected the two most potent, non-competing and virus-neutralizing antibodies to create REGN-COV2 and have scaled up this dual-antibody cocktail for clinical use with the company’s in-house VelociMab® and manufacturing capabilities. REGN-COV2’s two antibodies bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in recent Science publications. More recent research also demonstrates coverage against the now prevalent D614G variant.

Regeneron used the same ‘rapid response’ capabilities and cocktail approach to develop REGN-EB3, a novel triple antibody treatment for Ebola that is now under regulatory review by the FDA. REGN-COV2’s development and manufacturing has been funded in part with federal funds from the BARDA under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

 The US FDA’s BT designation is granted to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions allowing the program to benefit from all the FDA’s fast-track program feature
 In H2’21, EspeRare to enroll patients for the study which is also benefited with Fast Track and ODD and has also received the EMA’s PRIME designation and ODD","GENEVA, July 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — EspeRare, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to accelerating the development of treatments for rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to investigational ER-004 protein replacement therapy for the treatment for the prenatal treatment of XLHED, a life-threatening rare genetic condition.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation was granted following the promising results from three XLHED subjects who were treated by Professor Holm Schneider with a course of ER-004 intra-amniotic injections during the third trimester of pregnancy. These results, demonstrating that this prenatal treatment has a profound and life-changing effect on these infants, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine1.

The FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation intends to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. To be granted, it requires preliminary clinical evidence demonstrating that the drug may result in substantial improvement on at least one clinically-significant endpoint compared to available therapy. This Designation allows a program to benefit from all of the FDA’s fast-track program features, including proactive FDA guidance on an optimal drug development plan, organizational commitment involving FDA senior managers, and eligibility for rolling and priority reviews2.

“Rare diseases such as XLHED often don’t receive the attention and research investments that patients and their families deserve. The FDA’s decision to grant Breakthrough Therapy Designation to ER-004 for the prenatal treatment of XLHED represents a significant milestone for patients and EspeRare alike in highlighting the severity of this disease and the importance of offering a potential first therapeutic option to this underserved patient population,” said Caroline Kant, EspeRare’s Executive Director, and added, “This innovative treatment approach has the potential to fundamentally change the lives of these patients and may also pave the way for other prenatal treatments to correct genetic diseases before birth. We look forwards continuing to working closely with the FDA and the XLHED patient community towards these goals.”

Mary Fete, Executive Director of NFED (National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias), commented: “This is extraordinary news for our Ectodermal Dysplasias community in the United States and around the world. The NFED led the effort for three decades to develop a treatment for XLHED. Having the FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation means scientists can aspire starting a clinical trial to confirm the findings for ER-004 and ultimately, if successful, make this treatment an option for families. It brings us closer to an amazing time when children born with XLHED could have working sweat glands! We are honored to work with EspeRare to make this happen.”

In the second half of 2021, EspeRare anticipates to start enrolling patients into a pivotal study. In the United States this program also benefits from Fast Track and Orphan Drug Designation. In Europe, the program receives support from the EMA’s PRIME (Priority Medicines) and also the Orphan Drug Designation. With these multiple regulatory incentives, the program can aim at a streamlined worldwide development.

About the BD Veritor™ SARS-CoV-2 Assay
The BD Veritor™ Plus System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Assay is deemed to be a CLIA-waived immunoassay designed to be used in health care settings to provide an aid to rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic individuals. BD clinical studies performed at more than 20 sites across the U.S. demonstrated that the test is capable of achieving 84% sensitivity and 100% specificity, which is in line with the performance from similar immunoassay tests for Flu A/B, RSV and Strep A on the BD Veritor™ Plus System — all of which are widely-used, highly relevant and clinically valid. Similar to all immunoassay tests, FDA recommends that negative test results be confirmed by a molecular method to confirm the result, if necessary, for patient management.

The BD point-of-care test has not been cleared or approved by FDA. The test has been authorized by FDA under an EUA only for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigens to aid in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. It has not been authorized for use to detect any other viruses or pathogens. The test is authorized in the United States for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

Additionally, it allows to access data device performance, transmission history and helps in continues monitoring for asymptomatic episodes leading to early intervention
 Abbott’s Gallant has also received the CE Mark which offers treatment plans and the increased facilities for the patient leading to better outcomes","Next-generation Gallant™ implantable cardioverter-defibrillator family of devices offers Bluetooth® capability for a more meaningful connection between patients and their doctors
– Gallant ICD and CRT-D devices feature a patient-preferred design without compromising on battery longevity and compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
ABBOTT PARK, Ill., July 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the company’s next-generation Gallant™ implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices. The devices bring new benefits to patients with heart rhythm disorders, including a patient-preferred design without compromising battery longevity and MRI compatibility. In addition, the new devices offer Bluetooth technology and a new patient smartphone app for improved remote monitoring, allowing for increased patient/physician engagement and streamlined communications.

It is estimated that as many as 6.1 million people in the United States battle cardiac arrhythmias, or abnormal heart rhythms,1 and ICDs are used to help reduce the risks of life-threatening arrhythmias. For patients with heart failure or in situations when the heart’s chambers beat out of sync, CRT-Ds can be used to restore the heart’s natural pattern of beating.

“We are focused on developing and delivering life-changing technologies that impact patient care in a meaningful way,” said Randel Woodgrift, senior vice president, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Abbott. “The Gallant devices are the latest example of how Abbott is driving innovation to meet changing healthcare needs and helping to improve connectivity and engagement between patients and their doctors.”

The new Gallant system pairs with Abbott’s secure myMerlinPulse™, an iOS- and Android™- compatible mobile smartphone app that helps streamline communication between doctors and their patients. The app provides people with access to data, device performance, and transmission history, which helps them take an active role in their healthcare. Through the myMerlinPulse app, physicians can continuously monitor their patients remotely allowing for identification of asymptomatic episodes as well as patient-triggered transmissions, which can lead to earlier intervention and reduce clinical burden.

“The ability for patients to stay connected to their doctors via their implanted device and a smartphone app has the potential to change how healthcare providers and patients communicate with each other,” said Raffaele Corbisiero, M.D., FACC, director of electrophysiology and pacing at Deborah Heart and Lung Center, Browns Mills, N.J. “The FDA’s approval of Abbott’s Gallant devices enables doctors to provide a more collaborative approach to treatment plans and the increased bond between a patient and provider will lead to better outcomes for all.”

The Gallant system received CE Mark for use across Europe earlier this year.
