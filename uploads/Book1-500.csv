Phase 3 Study Unblinded Following Recommendation of Independent Data Monitoring Committee SPRING HOUSE, PA, The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced today the unblinding of the Phase 3 TITAN study evaluating ERLEADA  (apalutamide) plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). The decision resulted from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommendation coinciding with a pre-planned analysis that showed the dual primary endpoints were both achieved, significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). Based on these results, the IDMC recommended that patients in the placebo plus ADT group be given the opportunity to cross over to treatment with ERLEADA plus ADT. Patients will continue to be followed for OS and long-term safety as part of the TITAN study.
“The TITAN study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ERLEADA in combination with androgen deprivation therapy in patients with newly-diagnosed metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer, regardless of the extent of their disease,” said Margaret Yu, M.D., Vice President, Oncology Clinical Development, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. “We look to continue to build upon our understanding of ERLEADA for patients with metastatic prostate cancer as there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.” Results from the TITAN study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical congress. Applications seeking regulatory approval of ERLEADA supported by data from the Phase 3 TITAN study are planned for 2019. About Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Metastatic prostate cancer is cancer that has spread to another part of the body.1 Metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), refers to prostate cancer that still responds to ADT.1 Patients with newly-diagnosed metastatic disease tend to have a poorer prognosis, resulting in a need for new treatment options.2,3 About the TITAN Study TITAN is a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in men who were
newly diagnosed with metastatic disease, regardless of prognostic risk, volume of diseaes ERLEADA (apalutamide) is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). It became the first treatment to receive FDA approval for this disease state on February 14, 2018.5 The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Prostate Cancer include apalutamide as a treatment option for patients with non-metastatic (M0) CRPC with a category 1 recommendation (especially for those with a PSA doubling time =10 months)*.6 Additionally, the American Urological Association (AUA) Guidelines for
Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) were updated to include apalutamide (ERLEADA) with continued ADT as a treatment option that clinicians should offer to patients with asymptomatic nmCRPC. It is included as one of the options clinicians should offer to
patients with nmCRPC who are at high-risk for developing metastatic disease (Standard; Evidence Level Grade A)**.7 *Referenced with  permission from the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Prostate Cancer V.4.2018. © National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Inc. 2018.

ERLEADA IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION5 CONTRAINDICATIONS
Pregnancy — ERLEADA (apalutamide) can cause fetal harm and potential loss of
pregnancy.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Falls and Fractures — In a randomized study (SPARTAN), falls and fractures occurred in
16% and 12% of patients treated with ERLEADA compared to 9% and 7% treated with
placebo, respectively. Falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizure.
Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for
fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone targeted
agents.
Seizure — In a randomized study (SPARTAN), 2 patients (0.2%) treated with ERLEADA
experienced a seizure. Permanently discontinue ERLEADA in patients who develop a
seizure during treatment. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent
seizures with ERLEADA. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while receiving
ERLEADA and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause
harm to themselves or others.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse Reactions — The most common adverse reactions (=10%) were fatigue,
hypertension, rash, diarrhea, nausea, weight decreased, arthralgia, fall, hot flush,
decreased appetite, fracture, and peripheral edema.
Laboratory Abnormalities — All Grades (Grade 3-4)
• Hematology — anemia ERLEADA® 70% (0.4%), placebo 64% (0.5%);
leukopenia ERLEADA 47% (0.3%), placebo 29% (0%); lymphopenia ERLEADA
41% (2%), placebo 21% (2%)
• Chemistry — hypercholesterolemia ERLEADA 76% (0.1%), placebo 46% (0%);
hyperglycemia ERLEADA® 70% (2%), placebo 59% (1%); hypertriglyceridemia
ERLEADA® 67% (2%), placebo 49% (0.8%); hyperkalemia ERLEADA 32% (2%),
placebo 22% (0.5%)
Rash — Rash was most commonly described as macular or maculo-papular. Adverse
reactions were 24% with ERLEADA® versus 6% with placebo. Grade 3 rashes (defined as
covering &gt; 30% body surface area [BSA]) were reported with ERLEADA treatment (5%)
versus placebo (0.3%).
The onset of rash occurred at a median of 82 days. Rash resolved in 81% of patients within
a median of 60 days (range: 2 to 709 days) from onset of rash. Four percent of patients
treated with ERLEADA® received systemic corticosteroids. Rash recurred in approximately
half of patients who were re-challenged with ERLEADA.
Hypothyroidism was reported for 8% of patients treated with ERLEADA and 2% of
patients treated with placebo based on assessments of thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH) every 4 months. Elevated TSH occurred in 25% of patients treated with ERLEADA
and 7% of patients treated with placebo. The median onset was day 113. There were no
Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions. Thyroid replacement therapy, when clinically indicated,
should be initiated or dose-adjusted.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Effect of Other Drugs on ERLEADA — Co-administration of a strong CYP2C8 or CYP3A4
inhibitor is predicted to increase the steady-state exposure of the active moieties. No initial
dose adjustment is necessary; however, reduce the ERLEADA dose based on tolerability
[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
Effect of ERLEADA on Other Drugs — ERLEADA is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and
CYP2C19, and a weak inducer of CYP2C9 in humans. Concomitant use of ERLEADA® with
medications that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 can result in
lower exposure to these medications. Substitution for these medications is recommended
when possible or evaluate for loss of activity if medication is continued. Concomitant
administration of ERLEADA with medications that are substrates of UDP-glucuronosyl
transferase (UGT) can result in decreased exposure. Use caution if substrates of UGT must
be co-administered with ERLEADA and evaluate for loss of activity.
P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 substrates — Apalutamide is a weak inducer of P-glycoprotein
(P- gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and organic anion transporting
polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) clinically. Concomitant use of ERLEADA with medications that
are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, or OATP1B1 can result in lower exposure of these
medications. Use caution if substrates of P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 must be co-administered
with ERLEADA and evaluate for loss of activity if medication is continued.

KENILWORTH, N.J.--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced that V114, the company’s investigational 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by the vaccine serotypes in pediatric patients 6 weeks to 18 years of age. V114 is also under development for the prevention of IPD in adults. Both indications are currently being studied in Phase 3 clinical trials.
The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is an FDA program designed to expedite the development and review of drugs intended for serious or life-threatening conditions. To qualify for this designation, preliminary clinical evidence must demonstrate that the drug may provide substantial improvement over currently available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint. The benefits of this Breakthrough Therapy Designation include more intensive guidance from FDA on an efficient drug development program, access to a scientific liaison to help accelerate review time and eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review if relevant criteria are met.
The FDA’s decision was informed in part by immunogenicity data from two studies. Study 005 was a Phase 1/2, multicentre, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity profiles of 4 different lots of a new formulation of V114 in healthy adults and infants. Study 008 was a proof of concept, Phase 2, pediatric trial to confirm the results from Study 005 in a larger population of infants. In both studies, V114 induced an immune response in infants for two disease-causing serotypes (22F and 33F) not contained in the currently available 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, while demonstrating non-inferiority for the serotypes contained in both vaccines.
“We are pleased with the data on V114 compiled to date, and we look forward to working closely with the FDA on the subsequent development of this investigational vaccine,” said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, senior vice president and head of vaccine and infectious diseases clinical research at Merck Research Laboratories. “The goal of our program in pediatric patients remains focused on providing additional serotype coverage versus currently available vaccines, while at the same time maintaining a strong immune response across all serotypes in the vaccine.”

<p class=""p"">In a scientific first, Columbia neuroengineers have created a system that translates thought into intelligible, recognizable speech. By monitoring someone’s brain activity, the technology can reconstruct the words a person hears with unprecedented clarity. This breakthrough, which harnesses the power of speech synthesizers and artificial intelligence, could lead to new ways for computers to communicate directly with the brain. It also lays the groundwork for helping people who cannot speak, such as those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or recovering from stroke, regain their ability to communicate with the outside world.</p>
<p class=""p"">These findings were published today in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>
<p class=""p"">“Our voices help connect us to our friends, family and the world around us, which is why losing the power of one’s voice due to injury or disease is so devastating,” said Nima Mesgarani, PhD, the paper’s senior author and a principal investigator at Columbia University’s Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute. “With today’s study, we have a potential way to restore that power. We’ve shown that, with the right technology, these people’s thoughts could be decoded and understood by any listener.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote class=""pullquote inline"">This would be a game changer. It would give anyone who has lost their ability to speak, whether through injury or disease, the renewed chance to connect to the world around them.</blockquote>
</div>
<div class=""article body-text"">
<p class=""p"">Decades of research has shown that when people speak — or even imagine speaking — telltale patterns of activity appear in their brain. Distinct (but recognizable) pattern of signals also emerge when we listen to someone speak, or imagine listening. Experts, trying to record and decode these patterns, see a future in which thoughts need not remain hidden inside the brain — but instead could be translated into verbal speech at will.</p>
<p class=""p"">But accomplishing this feat has proven challenging. Early efforts to decode brain signals by Dr. Mesgarani and others focused on simple computer models that analyzed spectrograms, which are visual representations of sound frequencies.</p>
<p class=""p"">But because this approach has failed to produce anything resembling intelligible speech, Dr. Mesgarani and his team, including the paper's first author Hassan Akbari, turned instead to a vocoder, a computer algorithm that can synthesize speech after being trained on recordings of people talking.</p>
<p class=""p"">“This is the same technology used by Amazon Echo and Apple Siri to give verbal responses to our questions,” said Dr. Mesgarani, who is also an associate professor of electrical engineering at Columbia Engineering.</p>
<p class=""p"">To teach the vocoder to interpret to brain activity, Dr. Mesgarani teamed up with Ashesh Dinesh Mehta, MD, PhD, a neurosurgeon at Northwell Health Physician Partners Neuroscience Institute and co-author of today’s paper. Dr. Mehta treats epilepsy patients, some of whom must undergo regular surgeries.</p>
<p class=""p"">“Working with Dr. Mehta, we asked epilepsy patients already undergoing brain surgery to listen to sentences spoken by different people, while we measured patterns of brain activity,” said Dr. Mesgarani. “These neural patterns trained the vocoder.”</p>
<p class=""p"">Next, the researchers asked those same patients to listen to speakers reciting digits between 0 to 9, while recording brain signals that could then be run through the vocoder. The sound produced by the vocoder in response to those signals was analyzed and cleaned up by neural networks, a type of artificial intelligence that mimics the structure of neurons in the biological brain.</p>

<p class=""p""><em>Above: representation of researchers' new approach to audio reconstruction that uses a vocoder and deep neural network model.</em></p>
<p class=""p"">The end result was a robotic-sounding voice reciting a sequence of numbers. To test the accuracy of the recording, Dr. Mesgarani and his team tasked individuals to listen to the recording and report what they heard.</p>
<p class=""p"">“We found that people could understand and repeat the sounds about 75% of the time, which is well above and beyond any previous attempts,” said Dr. Mesgarani. The improvement in intelligibility was especially evident when comparing the new recordings to the earlier, spectrogram-based attempts. “The sensitive vocoder and powerful neural networks represented the sounds the patients had originally listened to with surprising accuracy.”</p>
<p class=""p"">Dr. Mesgarani and his team plan to test more complicated words and sentences next, and they want to run the same tests on brain signals emitted when a person speaks or imagines speaking. Ultimately, they hope their system could be part of an implant, similar to those worn by some epilepsy patients, that translates the wearer’s thoughts directly into words.</p>
<p class=""p"">“In this scenario, if the wearer thinks ‘I need a glass of water,’ our system could take the brain signals generated by that thought, and turn them into synthesized, verbal speech,” said Dr. Mesgarani. “This would be a game changer. It would give anyone who has lost their ability to speak, whether through injury or disease, the renewed chance to connect to the world around them.”</p>

<div class=""xn-content"">
INDIANAPOLIS,-- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval for a new indication for ALIMTA<sup>®</sup> (pemetrexed for injection) in combination with KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab), developed and marketed by Merck (known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada), and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. This indication is approved based on data from Merck's Phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial, which enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 expression and had dual primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).

</div>
ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and carboplatin was first approved in June 2018 under the FDA's accelerated approval process for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, based on tumor response rates and PFS data from the Phase 2 study KEYNOTE-021 (Cohort G1). In accordance with the accelerated approval process, continued approval was contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit, which has now been demonstrated in the KEYNOTE-189 trial and has resulted in the FDA converting the accelerated approval to full (regular) approval.
""KEYNOTE-189 demonstrated an exceptional effect of the ALIMTA-pembrolizumab-platinum chemotherapy combination in the first-line setting, offering significantly improved survival in patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations,"" said Anne White, president, Lilly Oncology. ""This new indication reinforces Lilly's continued commitment to providing practice-changing treatment options that can make a meaningful difference for people living with lung cancer.""
ALIMTA is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pemetrexed. See additional Important Safety Information below.
<b><u>KEYNOTE-189 Trial Results
</u></b>On August 20, 2018, Merck's pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA for this indication, based on data from the KEYNOTE-189 study, which demonstrated that treatment with ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy resulted in significantly longer OS and PFS than ALIMTA plus platinum chemotherapy with placebo.

In the KEYNOTE-189 study, safety was evaluated in 405 patients who received ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy and 202 patients who received placebo, ALIMTA and platinum chemotherapy. ALIMTA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 23 percent of patients in the ALIMTA-pembrolizumab-platinum chemotherapy arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of ALIMTA in this arm were acute kidney injury (3%) and pneumonitis (2%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of ALIMTA occurred in 49 percent of patients in the ALIMTA-pembrolizumab-platinum chemotherapy arm; the most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of ALIMTA in this arm (=2%) were neutropenia (12%), anemia (7%), asthenia (4%), pneumonia (4%), thrombocytopenia (4%), increased blood creatinine (3%), diarrhea (3%), and fatigue (3%). Adverse reactions of any grade occurring in =20 percent of patients receiving ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy were nausea (56%), fatigue (56%), constipation (35%), diarrhea (31%), decreased appetite (28%), rash (25%), vomiting (24%), cough (21%), dyspnea (21%) and pyrexia (20%).
<b><u>KEYNOTE-189 Trial Design
</u></b>Conducted by Merck, the KEYNOTE-189 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02578680), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, evaluated ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and cisplatin or carboplatin compared with ALIMTA in combination with placebo and cisplatin or carboplatin, in 616 untreated patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression. Patients had no sensitizing EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and had not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease. This was a treat-to-progression protocol, with both ALIMTA and pembrolizumab being used until progression or unacceptable toxicity (or 35 cycles for pembrolizumab)<sup>1</sup>, and had dual primary endpoints of OS and PFS [assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)]; secondary endpoints include overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Patients were randomized 2:1 to one of two treatment groups, as follows:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>ALIMTA (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) (with vitamin supplementation) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg fixed dose every three weeks) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min on day one every three weeks (Q3W) for four cycles, followed by ALIMTA (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W; or</li>
 	<li>ALIMTA (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) (with vitamin supplementation) plus saline placebo plus cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min on day one every three weeks (Q3W) for four cycles, followed by ALIMTA (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) plus placebo Q3W.</li>
</ul>
Patients on the control arm who experienced disease progression, verified by central independent review, were permitted to undergo treatment assignment unblinding and crossover to receive open-label pembrolizumab. The KEYNOTE-189 study was conducted in collaboration with Lilly.
<b><u>About Lung Cancer
</u></b>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. and most other countries, killing nearly 1.7 million people worldwide each year.<sup>2</sup> In the U.S., lung cancer is responsible for approximately 25 percent of all cancer deaths, more than those from breast, colon and prostate cancers combined.<sup>3</sup> Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a very difficult-to-treat cancer and the prognosis is poor for metastatic NSCLC.<sup>4</sup> NSCLC is much more common than other types of lung cancer and accounts for about 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.<sup>5</sup> For those people afflicted with NSCLC, about 70 percent have nonsquamous cell carcinoma, while about 30 percent have squamous cell carcinoma.<sup>5</sup>
<b>About ALIMTA<sup>®</sup> (pemetrexed for injection)
</b>ALIMTA is indicated in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy for the initial treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. For all FDA-approved indications for ALIMTA, please see full <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2361930-1&amp;h=3443010255&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fpi.lilly.com%2Fus%2Falimta-pi.pdf&amp;a=Prescribing+Information"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Prescribing Information</a>.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ALIMTA<sup>®</sup> (pemetrexed for injection)</b>
<b>CONTRAINDICATION</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>ALIMTA is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pemetrexed.</li>
</ul>
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>
<b>Myelosuppression and Increased Risk of Myelosuppression Without Vitamin Supplementation</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>ALIMTA can cause severe myelosuppression resulting in a requirement for transfusions and which may lead to neutropenic infection. The risk of myelosuppression is increased in patients who do not receive vitamin supplementation.</li>
 	<li>Prior to treatment with ALIMTA, patients must be instructed to initiate supplementation with oral folic acid. Intramuscular injections of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are also required prior to ALIMTA treatment. Folic acid and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation should be continued during treatment and for 21 days after the last dose of ALIMTA as they may reduce the severity of treatment-related hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities. Obtain a complete blood count at the beginning of each cycle. Do not administer ALIMTA until the ANC is at least 1500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Permanently reduce ALIMTA in patients with an ANC of less than 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or platelet count of less than 50,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in previous cycles.</li>
 	<li>In Studies JMDB and JMCH, among patients who received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia was 15% and 23%, the incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia was 6% and 4%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was 4% and 5%, respectively. In Study JMCH, 18% of patients in the ALIMTA arm required red blood cell transfusions compared to 7% of patients in the cisplatin arm. In Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI, where all patients received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia ranged from 3% to 5%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia ranged from 3% to 5%.</li>
</ul>
<b>Renal Failure</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>ALIMTA can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, renal toxicity. Determine creatinine clearance before each dose and periodically monitor renal function during treatment with ALIMTA.</li>
 	<li>The incidences of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA with cisplatin were 2.1% in Study JMDB and 2.2% in Study JMCH. The incidence of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA as a single agent ranged from 0.4% to 0.6% (Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI).</li>
 	<li>Withhold ALIMTA in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 mL/min.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Toxicity</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Serious and sometimes fatal, bullous, blistering, and exfoliative skin toxicity, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, can occur with ALIMTA. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for severe and life-threatening bullous, blistering, or exfoliating skin toxicity.</li>
</ul>
<b>Interstitial Pneumonitis</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Serious interstitial pneumonitis, including fatal cases, can occur with ALIMTA treatment. Withhold ALIMTA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, or fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If pneumonitis is confirmed, permanently discontinue ALIMTA.</li>
</ul>
<b>Radiation Recall</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Radiation recall can occur with ALIMTA in patients who have received radiation weeks to years previously. Monitor patients for inflammation or blistering in areas of previous radiation treatment. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for signs of radiation recall.</li>
</ul>
<b>Increased Risk of Toxicity With Ibuprofen in Patients With Renal Impairment</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Exposure to ALIMTA is increased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment who take concomitant ibuprofen, increasing the risks of adverse reactions of ALIMTA. In patients with creatinine clearances between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min, avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA. If concomitant ibuprofen use cannot be avoided, monitor patients more frequently for ALIMTA adverse reactions, including myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity.</li>
</ul>
<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALIMTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in developmental delays and increased malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose of 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 3 months after the final dose.</li>
</ul>
<b>DRUG INTERACTIONS</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Ibuprofen increases exposure (AUC) of pemetrexed. In patients with creatinine clearance between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min:</li>
 	<li>Avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA.</li>
 	<li>Monitor patients more frequently for myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity, if concomitant administration of ibuprofen cannot be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Severe adverse reactions (Grade 3-4) occurring in =20% of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) versus ALIMTA with platinum chemotherapy + placebo for initial treatment (KEYNOTE-189), respectively, were fatigue (12% vs 6%); diarrhea (5% vs 3%); dyspnea (3.7% vs 5%); vomiting (3.7% vs 3%); nausea (3.5% vs 3.5%); rash (2% vs 2.5%); decreased appetite (1.5% vs 0.5%); constipation (1% vs 0.5%); and pyrexia (0.2% vs 0%).</li>
 	<li>Common adverse reactions (all grades) occurring in =20% of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) versus ALIMTA with platinum chemotherapy + placebo for initial treatment (KEYNOTE-189), respectively, were nausea (56% vs 52%); fatigue (56% vs 58%); constipation (35% vs 32%); diarrhea (31% vs 21%); decreased appetite (28% vs 30%); rash (25% vs 17%); vomiting (24% vs 23%); cough (21% vs 28%); dyspnea (21% vs 26%); and pyrexia (20% vs 15%).</li>
</ul>
<b>USE IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Lactation</b>: There is no information regarding the presence of pemetrexed or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from ALIMTA, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ALIMTA and for one week after the last dose.</li>
 	<li><b>Males of Reproductive Potential</b>: ALIMTA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible.</li>
 	<li><b>Pediatric Use</b>: The safety and effectiveness of ALIMTA in pediatric patients have not been established. Adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients studied were similar to those observed in adults.</li>
 	<li><b>Patients with Renal Impairment</b>: ALIMTA is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Decreased renal function results in reduced clearance and greater exposure (AUC) to ALIMTA compared with patients with normal renal function. No dose is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min.</li>
 	<li><b>Geriatric</b>: The incidences of Grade 3-4 anemia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and neutropenia were higher in patients 65 years of age and older as compared to younger patients: in at least one of five randomized clinical trials.</li>

<span class=""xn-location"">RARITAN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Jan. 31, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with MeiraGTx Holdings plc (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/janssen-enters-worldwide-collaboration-and-license-agreement-with-meiragtx-to-develop-gene-therapy-programs-for-inherited-retinal-diseases-300787241.html#financial-modal"">MGTX</a>), a clinical-stage gene therapy company, to develop, manufacture and commercialize its clinical stage inherited retinal disease portfolio, including leading product candidates for achromatopsia (ACHM) caused by mutations in either CNGB3 or CNGA3, and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP). Further, the companies have formed a research collaboration to explore new targets for other inherited retinal diseases and further develop adeno-associated virus (AAV) manufacturing technology.

""Janssen is excited to expand our portfolio with the addition of innovative assets that have the potential to improve sight or prevent the progression to blindness in inherited retinal diseases which currently have no treatment options,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">James List</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular &amp; Metabolism, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""We look forward to partnering with MeiraGTx to develop these assets and explore new potential targets for inherited retinal diseases.""

Under the terms of the agreement, MeiraGTx will grant Janssen an exclusive worldwide license to certain clinical assets in MeiraGTx's inherited retinal disease portfolio. The companies have also formed a research collaboration to develop a pipeline of products addressing novel gene targets, giving Janssen the exclusive option to license new treatments for other inherited retinal diseases.

""This collaboration builds on Janssen's long-standing heritage of addressing the unmet needs of patients around the world,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Mathai Mammen</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""Through this collaboration we look forward to deepening our expertise in gene therapy and leveraging our breadth of research and development expertise to help bring forward new treatment options for people living with inherited retinal diseases.""

<b>About Achromatopsia, AAV-CNGB3, and AAV-CNGA3<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Achromatopsia is an inherited retinal disease that prevents cone photoreceptors from functioning. Patients are legally blind from birth and usually suffer from severely reduced visual acuity of 20/200 or worse; a disabling sensitivity to light, or photophobia; total color blindness; and involuntary back and forth eye movements, or nystagmus. There are currently no approved treatments for achromatopsia.

AAV-CNGB3 and AAV-CNGA3, gene therapy candidates designed to restore cone function, are delivered via subretinal injection to the area of the eye where most of the cones in the retina are located. AAV-CNGB3 was granted orphan drug designation (ODD), rare pediatric disease and Fast Track designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and orphan medicinal product and PRIME designations by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of achromatopsia caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AAV-CNGB3 in both adult and pediatric patients is underway.

<b>About X-Linked Retinitis Pigmentosa and AAV-RGPR<br class=""dnr"" /></b>X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) represent some of the most severe forms of RP, resulting in early onset in childhood and rapid progression to blindness by the time patients reach 20 to 30 years old. In XLRP, both rods and cones function poorly, leading to degeneration of the retina and total blindness. There are currently no approved treatments for XLRP.

AAV-RGPR is designed to treat the most common form of XLRP caused by mutations in the RPGR gene. Both rod and cone photoreceptors require RPGR to function. AAV-RPGR has received Fast Track designation and ODD from the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation from the EMA. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AAV-RPGR in adult and pediatric patients is underway.

Berlin, Bayer and Kyoto University have agreed on a strategic research alliance to jointly identify new drug targets for the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a life-threatening chronic disease in which, over time, tissue of the lungs becomes more and more thick and stiff, leading to a progressive loss of lung function. Although research has identified key factors in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, no direct cause leading to this disease is known. The goal of the research alliance is to identify specific targets and pathways that are causing the disease and to discover new treatments to modulate these pathways and prevent further lung function decline.
“In line with our strategy to complement in-house research through external innovation approaches, we are collaborating with Kyoto University in the area of pulmonology to identify new treatment options for patients suffering from lung diseases”, said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG's Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a disease with a high unmet medical need and we hope that the collaboration with Kyoto University will lead to the identification of new drug targets that make significant differences to patients.”
The collaboration will build on discoveries and expertise developed by Dr. Atsuyasu Sato at the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine at Kyoto University, especially with regard to the role of epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of IPF, combining it with Bayer’s expertise in drug discovery and development. Both partners will contribute personnel, infrastructure and unique technologies to further explore common hypotheses allowing identification of new treatment options.
Under the agreement, Bayer and Kyoto University will jointly conduct research activities to identify new drug targets. Bayer will have an option for the exclusive use of the collaboration results. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
“We are committed to discover novel therapeutics for lung diseases through our innovative approaches established in the respiratory medicine and thoracic surgery departments”, said Professor Dr. Toyohiro Hirai, Head of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine at Kyoto University. “We are very excited to work on multiple projects with Bayer jointly and closely. Combining our expertise, we will deepen our understanding of intractable lung diseases including IPF to search for new treatments.”
The new research alliance in pulmonology was established with the support of Kyoto University Medical Business Liaison Organization (KUMBL) and follows on a previous, broad range research agreement with Kyoto University’s Office of Society-Academia Collaboration for Innovation (KU-SACI) that was signed in 2014 to explore potential joint research projects.
About Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease affecting approximately 5 million people globally. Scarring of lung tissue occurs over time, leading to a progressive loss of lung function. The formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis. As the lung tissue thickens, gas exchange from the lungs to the blood stream decreases over time. As a result, the brain and other organs are undersupplied with oxygen. Although research has identified key factors in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, no direct cause leading to this disease is known. This is why the disease is called “idiopathic” pulmonary fibrosis. Acute IPF exacerbations are defined as a rapid worsening of symptoms within days or weeks and reducing the risk of acute exacerbations is a key treatment goal in the management of all patients with IPF.
About Kyoto University
Kyoto University was founded in 1897 as the second oldest imperial university in Japan. Since that time, Kyoto University has remained faithful to its principle of “academic freedom” and has focused its efforts in developing a strong sense of purpose reflected in its mission statement: “To sustain and develop its historical commitment to academic freedom and pursue a state of harmonious coexistence within the human and ecological community on this planet.” Recognized as one of Japan’s foremost research institutions, the achievements of Kyoto University’s scholars are acknowledged throughout the world. A prominent recent example was the awards of the 2012 and 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Dr. Shinya Yamanaka of the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application for his unique discoveries in the field of stem cell research and to Dr. Tasuku Honjo of Professor at Department of Immunology and Genomic Medicine for his discovery of the PD-L1-targeted cancer immunotherapy.

- Collaboration provides opportunity to diversify Alexion’s clinical-stage rare hematology portfolio -
- Caelum to receive up to $60 million for equity investment and option fee -
- Alexion has option to acquire Caelum based on Phase 2 data -
""We believe CAEL-101 holds significant promise in being able to help these patients and we’re excited to add it to our growing clinical-stage rare hematology portfolio.""
BOSTON &amp; NEW YORK---Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) and Caelum Biosciences today announced a collaboration to develop CAEL-101 for light chain (AL) amyloidosis. CAEL-101 is a first-in-class amyloid fibril targeted therapy designed to improve organ function by reducing or eliminating amyloid deposits in patients with AL amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis is a rare systemic disorder that causes misfolded immunoglobulin light chain protein to build up in and around tissues, resulting in progressive and widespread organ damage, most commonly to the heart and kidneys.
“With a median survival time of less than 18 months following diagnosis and no approved therapies to address the organ damage caused by AL amyloidosis, there is a significant need for new treatments for this devastating disease,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research &amp; Development at Alexion. “We believe CAEL-101 holds significant promise in being able to help these patients and we’re excited to add it to our growing clinical-stage rare hematology portfolio.”
Michael Spector, President and Chief Executive Officer of Caelum, said, “CAEL-101 appears to have a unique capability of binding to both kappa and lambda misfolded proteins. Data from the Phase 1a/1b study indicate that CAEL-101 is a well-tolerated therapy that leads to a rapid and clinically relevant organ response, particularly in the heart and kidneys. Further, CAEL-101 showed a statistically significant improvement from baseline in global longitudinal strain, an endpoint that has been correlated with survival in patients with AL amyloidosis. We are very pleased to collaborate with Alexion, a global leader in the rare disease field.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will acquire a minority equity interest in Caelum and an exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity in the company based on Phase 2 data for pre-negotiated economics. Alexion will make payments to Caelum totaling up to $60 million, including the purchase price for the equity and milestone-dependent development funding payments. The collaboration also provides for potential additional payments of up to $500 million, including the upfront and regulatory and commercial milestone payments, in the event Alexion exercises the acquisition option. The collaboration will leverage Alexion’s expertise in rare disease antibody development and commercial franchise in hematology. Alexion and Caelum will collaborate on the design of the ongoing development program for CAEL-101. Caelum will be responsible for conducting the development program through the end of Phase 2 and for manufacturing CAEL-101.
About CAEL-101
CAEL-101 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to improve organ function by reducing or eliminating amyloid deposits in the tissues and organs of patients with AL amyloidosis. The antibody is designed to bind to insoluble light chain amyloid protein, including both kappa and lambda subtypes. In a Phase 1a/1b study, CAEL-101 demonstrated improved organ function, including cardiac and renal function, in 27 patients with relapsed and refractory AL amyloidosis who had previously not had an organ response to standard of care therapy. CAEL-101 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a therapy for patients with AL amyloidosis and as a radio-imaging agent in AL amyloidosis.
About AL Amyloidosis
AL amyloidosis is a rare systemic disorder caused by an abnormality of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Misfolded immunoglobulin light chains produced by plasma cells aggregate and form fibrils that deposit in tissues and organs, gradually affecting their function. This can cause progressive and widespread organ damage and high mortality rates, with death most frequently occurring as a result of cardiac failure. Current standard of care includes plasma cell directed chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant, but these therapies do not address the organ dysfunction caused by amyloid deposition, and up to 80 percent of patients are ineligible for transplant.
AL amyloidosis is a rare disease but is the most common form of amyloidosis. There are approximately 22,000 patients across the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. AL amyloidosis has a one-year mortality rate of 47 percent, 76 percent of which is caused by cardiac amyloidosis.

<div class=""xn-content"">
SAN FRANCISCO, -- Audentes Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BOLD), a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative gene therapy products for patients living with serious, life-threatening rare diseases, today provided an update following the receipt of minutes from its Regenerative Medicine and Advanced Therapy (RMAT)/Type B meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) held in December 2018, regarding the company's lead gene therapy candidate, AT132, for the treatment of X-linked Myotubular Myopathy (XLMTM).
The goal of the meeting was to review nonclinical, clinical, and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) data generated to date in the AT132 program, and to align with the FDA on program next-steps to enable submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT132.
""We're pleased that our first discussion with the FDA under RMAT was both collaborative and productive, and provided a potential path toward BLA submission for AT132,"" stated Matthew R. Patterson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  ""We appreciate the constructive feedback provided by the Agency and look forward to working with the FDA to advance AT132 to registration as quickly as possible.""
Following the meeting, Audentes is proceeding with its previously announced plan to enroll an additional 3-5 patients in Cohort 2 (3x10<sup>14</sup> vector genomes per kilogram dose level) of ASPIRO, the Phase 1/2 study of AT132.  Optimal dose selection is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019, after the evaluation of the six-month biopsy results from the first three patients dosed in Cohort 2.  Subsequent to the determination of the optimal dose, Audentes plans to provide an updated data package to FDA to facilitate final agreement on the path to BLA submission.  Audentes also received preliminary feedback on its CMC characterization and validation plans and will submit the requested information to the Investigational New Drug (IND) application on a continuing basis.
In pursuit of global regulatory approvals for AT132, Audentes also initiated discussions with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the fourth quarter of 2018 under the recently granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation.  In the first quarter of 2019, Audentes anticipates receiving scientific advice from the EMA that will begin to define the path toward submission of a European Marketing Authorization Application.

<strong>Pol? inhibitor opportunity</strong>
DNA Polymerase ? (Pol?) is a unique, multifunctional DNA polymerase essential to repairing DNA breaks, especially in homologous recombination deficient (HRD) cells. HRD, including deficiency in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is a clinically important feature across a variety of important tumor types, including breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Pol? gene expression is low in normal cells but elevated across a broad range of tumor types, including those with HRD. Currently, HRD tumors may be treated with Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which represent a rapidly growing, multi-billion dollar global market. A significant fraction of patients does not initially respond to PARP inhibitor treatment, and the vast majority of treated patients eventually develop PARP inhibitor resistance. A Pol? inhibitor has potential as both a mono-therapy across multiple tumor types and in combination with PARP inhibitors, where its distinct mechanism of action may help address both forms of PARP resistance. Additional clinical populations may also be attractive for combination treatment with a Pol? inhibitor, including possible combinations with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and Immuno-Oncology agents.

<div></div>
<div class=""quicklinks"">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today is warning patients and doctors, who use at-home or in-the-office medical devices to monitor levels of the blood thinner warfarin, that certain test strips used with the devices may provide inaccurate results and should not be relied upon to adjust the drug dosage. Medical product distributor Terrific Care/Medex Supply LLC issued a voluntary recall of certain Roche Diagnostics test strip lots used with CoaguChek test meter devices last month. Today, the FDA classified this action as a Class I recall, the most serious type of recall, which means use of these devices may cause serious injuries or death. This recall is related to the November 2018 Roche Diagnostics Recall, the manufacturer of CoaguChek meters and test strips.</div>

The previous recall conducted by Roche, which is still in effect, involved more than 1.1 million packages of CoaguChek XS PT Test Strips that were distributed nationwide from Jan. 12, 2018 to Oct. 29, 2018. The CoaguChek XS PT Test Strips announced in today’s recall were manufactured by Roche, but distributed by Terrific Care/Medex Supply and include catalog numbers that were not included in the recent Roche recall because these strips were not labeled or authorized for sale in the U.S. and were only distributed by Roche Diagnostics outside the country. Terrific Care/Medex Supply purchased the Roche test strips from an unknown source and imported and sold them in the U.S.
“Monitoring warfarin dosing is a critical part of using the drug properly to prevent and treat blood clots. Using faulty strips can lead to errors in medication dosage that could cause serious harm or death in some patients. That’s why it’s so concerning that this distributor continued to sell these test strips in the U.S. even though domestic sales had been stopped due to safety concerns. To reduce risks to patients, we’re warning health care providers and the public about the dangers associated with this product,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Distributing products that are not labeled or authorized for sale in the United States raises significant concerns for us in view of the serious safety issues with these test strip devices, and our work on this matter is not finished. Our top priority is the immediate safety of patients, and we’re taking steps to ensure the products that this company distributed are removed from the market.”
As with the previous recall, the FDA is warning patients and health care professionals that they should not rely on these test meter devices to monitor warfarin levels if they’re using test strips affected by the recall. Instead, they should have blood drawn from a vein and have their levels measured by a laboratory test or use an alternative meter device.
Millions of Americans take the blood thinner warfarin (also known by the brand names Coumadin and Jantoven) to prevent and treat blood clots. The drug may be prescribed for patients with certain types of irregular heartbeats, blood clots in the legs or lungs, or certain medical device implants such as artificial heart valves. Achieving the correct warfarin dosage is crucial, and patients need regular monitoring to test how long it takes their blood to clot. The response is measured by a blood test to check the International Normalized Ratio, or INR. This test can be performed by an accredited laboratory on blood drawn from a vein or with a fingerstick blood draw using an INR test meter at home or in a doctor’s office.
The FDA’s <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm624904.htm"" target="""" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">previous warning</a> concerning the CoaguChek XS PT Test Strips was based on medical device reports submitted by Roche Diagnostics to the agency indicating that the test strips may provide results that are higher than the actual INR. As a result of incorrect INR results, some patients may be prescribed an insufficient warfarin dose or instructed to interrupt warfarin use, which may increase the risk for dangerous blood clots.
Incorrect INR results are of particular concern for individuals at an increased risk of blood clots including those with mechanical heart valves, with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) who are at a high risk of stroke, or those who had a recent blood clot. It is important to note that problems with the CoaguChek XS PT test strips are not likely to be evident to the patient.
The test strips are used with the CoaguChek XS plus, CoaguChek XS Pro, CoaguChek XS professional, CoaguChek XS PST and CoaguChek Vantus test meter devices.
Patients and health care providers who are using CoaguChek meters should immediately stop using test strips purchased from Terrific Care/Medex Supply and use an alternative test method.
All health care providers, patients and caregivers, are strongly encouraged to voluntarily report INR test meter problems directly to the FDA through <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/ucm2005699.htm"" target="""" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MedWatch, the FDA’s voluntary reporting program</a>. Problems should be reported whenever one suspects that there may be an issue with an INR test meter such as a malfunction or incorrect result, or that the meter caused or contributed to a serious injury or death.
The FDA is committed to continuing to communicate publicly on this issue and will provide updates related to this recall when available.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

Adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) will be able to access another revolutionary chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell (CAR T-cell) therapy through the Cancer Drugs Fund.
Tisagenlecleucel, also known as Kymriah and made by Novartis, is recommended for adults with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. It will be offered to people whose disease has not responded or those whose disease has relapsed after treatment with two or more courses of chemotherapy.
Lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system which is part of the immune system. There were 11,690 new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in England in 2015 with 4,688 of these being diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

<div class=""zone zone-content""><article class=""news-content""><strong>Meindert Boysen, director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation at NICE said:</strong> “Recommending another revolutionary CAR T-cell therapy for adults with lymphoma represents a step forward for personalised medicine. We are pleased that patients are set to benefit from such an innovative therapy so rapidly because of joint working between NICE, NHS England and the company.“CAR T-cell therapy is expensive, however the treatment is specific to each individual and could be a potential cure for some, although it is early days. Our recommendation for tisagenlecleucel on the Cancer Drugs Fund means people can benefit while more data is collected.”
CAR T-cell therapies are specifically manufactured for each individual patient. This involves taking some of the patient’s own white blood cells which are then reengineered in a laboratory so they can recognise and attack cancer cells before being infused back into the patient
The list price for tisagenlecleucel is £282,000 and it is given as a single intravenous infusion. The company have agreed to offer the therapy at a confidential discounted price. It is estimated 200 people will be eligible for treatment each year in the UK and NHS England are working closely with several hospitals across the country to deliver this complex treatment.
<strong>Lymphoma Action Chief Executive, Ropinder Gill, said: </strong>“We’re very pleased that this ground-breaking CAR T-cell therapy will now be available on the NHS for some people with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  This is really good news for people affected by this type of lymphoma who, until now, have faced limited treatment options. The news offers patients and their families faced with a poor prognosis a more hopeful outlook.”
<strong>John Stewart, Director of Specialised Commissioning at NHS England said: </strong>“The NHS has agreed another deal with the manufacturer Novartis which means that from next week more patients will benefit from this game changing treatment at even more hospitals throughout the country.
“Providing the latest cutting edge treatments for patients through competitive drug deals and offering more personalised medicines like CAR T-cell therapy are just two of the ways that the NHS Long Term Plan will transform cancer care across the country.”
<strong>Dr Alasdair Rankin, Director of Research and Patient Experience at the blood cancer charity Bloodwise, said:</strong> “CAR T-cell therapy is the most promising breakthrough in blood cancer treatment of the past decade, with the potential to be used much more widely in the future.
""Ensuring access to CAR T-cell therapies gives these patients the real chance of long-term survival when all other treatments have failed.""

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Recommendation Based on Significant Overall Survival Benefit Demonstrated with KEYTRUDA in Combination with Chemotherapy in Pivotal KEYNOTE-407 Trial</b></p>
</div>

<div class=""panel-pane pane-pr-body"">
<div class=""pane-content"">
KENILWORTH, N.J.--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion recommending KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults. This recommendation is based on results from the pivotal, Phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 trial, which enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status. The trial showed a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for patients taking KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) compared with chemotherapy alone. If approved, this would mark the first approval in Europe for an anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy for adults with metastatic squamous NSCLC.
“We are pleased by today’s positive opinion from the CHMP, which brings us one step closer to potentially expanding our lung cancer indications in Europe to include first-line combination therapy for patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “This is important as squamous cell carcinoma continues to be an area of unmet need, and there was a significant overall survival benefit observed in the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 trial.”
Data from KEYNOTE-407 were presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and were published in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>. The CHMP’s recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission for marketing authorization in the European Union (EU). The decision by the European Commission is expected in the first quarter of 2019.
KEYNOTE-407 is part of Merck’s leading clinical development program in lung cancer, which includes 10 Merck-sponsored Phase 3 trials. These trials are evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with other treatments and as monotherapy, in both advanced and earlier stages of disease, as well as across different histologies and lines of treatment.
<b>About Lung Cancer in Europe</b>
Lung cancer, which forms in the tissues of the lungs, usually within cells lining the air passages, is the leading cause of cancer death in Europe and worldwide. In 2018, there were nearly 388,000 deaths from lung cancer in Europe. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85 percent of all cases. There are several subtypes of NSCLC, including adenocarcinoma (accounting for 40 percent of lung cancers), squamous cell carcinoma (25 to 30 percent) and large cell carcinoma (10 to 15 percent).
<b>About KEYTRUDA</b> <sup><b>®</b> </sup><b>(pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg</b>
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 900 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.
<b>KEYTRUDA</b> <sup><b>®</b> </sup><b>(pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing in the U.S.</b>
<i>Melanoma</i>
KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
<i>Lung Cancer</i>
KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
<b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b>
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

<strong>About ENHANZE® Technology</strong>
Halozyme's proprietary ENHANZE® drug-delivery technology is based on its patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme (rHuPH20). rHuPH20 has been shown to remove traditional limitations on the volume of biologics that can be delivered subcutaneously (just under the skin). By using rHuPH20, some biologics and compounds that are administered intravenously may instead be delivered subcutaneously. ENHANZE® may also benefit subcutaneous biologics by reducing the need for multiple injections. This delivery has been shown in studies to reduce health care practitioner time required for administration and shorten time for drug administration

INDIANAPOLIS, Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) and Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY) announced today that baricitinib met the primary endpoint in BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, two Phase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). In both investigational trials, compared to patients treated with placebo, a statistically significant proportion of patients treated with baricitinib achieved the primary endpoint at Week 16 defined by the Investigator's Global Assessment for AD (IGA) score of clear or almost clear (IGA 0,1). These are two of five studies that will be part of the placebo-controlled data program intended to support global registrations.
In the 16-week placebo-controlled phase of BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events with baricitinib treatment was similar to placebo, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events observed were nasopharyngitis and headache. No venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), or deaths were reported.
""Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can negatively impact the quality of life for patients, and unfortunately there are limited treatment options, particularly oral medications,"" said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. ""We are encouraged that baricitinib met the primary endpoints in these two studies, and look forward to seeing the collective results of all five studies.""
Lilly plans to share the full data results from both the BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 studies at future scientific venues and in peer-reviewed journals, as well as the topline data from other ongoing Phase 3 trials later this year.
Baricitinib is approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in more than 50 countries, including the U.S., member states of the EU and Japan, and is marketed as OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup>.
<b>Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients
</b>OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup> (baricitinib) 2 mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets</b><b> </b>
<b>WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS</b>
<b><i>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</i>: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.</b>
<b>Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.</b>
<b><i>MALIGNANCIES</i>: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.</b>
<b><i>THROMBOSIS</i>: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.</b>
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>
<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS: </b>The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>with chronic or recurrent infection</li>
 	<li>who have been exposed to TB</li>
 	<li>with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection</li>
 	<li>who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or</li>
 	<li>with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.</li>
</ul>
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.
<b>Tuberculosis </b>– Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.
<b>Viral Reactivation</b> – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.
The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.
<b>MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS:</b> Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.
<b>THROMBOSIS</b><b>:</b> Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.
<b>GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: </b>Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.
<b>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:
</b><b><i>Neutropenia</i></b> – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
<b><i>Lymphopenia</i></b> – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
<b><i>Anemia</i></b> – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to &lt;8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
<b><i>Liver Enzyme Elevations</i></b> – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to =5x and =10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.
Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.
<b><i>Lipid Elevations</i></b> – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.
<b>VACCINATIONS</b>: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.
<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</b>Adverse reactions (=1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%), and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.
<b>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
</b><b>PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: </b>No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.
<b>HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: </b>Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.

<b>About BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE AD-2
</b>The BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 clinical trials are multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib monotherapy in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Significant improvement in disease activity was determined by the proportion of patients on baricitinib achieving clear (0) or almost clear skin (1) with a greater than or equal to 2-point improvement as measured by the 5-point Investigator's Global Assessment for AD (IGA) scale at 16 weeks of treatment.
<b>About OLUMIANT
</b>OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies. There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known. OLUMIANT is approved in more than 50 countries.
<b>About Atopic Dermatitis
</b>Atopic dermatitis (AD), a serious form of eczema, is a chronic, relapsing skin disease characterized by intense itching, dry skin and inflammation that can be present on any part of the body. AD is a heterogeneous disease both clinically and biologically, but may be characterized by chronic baseline symptoms of itch, redness and skin damage that are often punctuated with episodic, sometimes unpredictable, flares or exacerbations. AD affects approximately 1-3 percent of adults worldwide.
Moderate-to-severe AD is characterized by intense itching, resulting in visibly damaged skin and sleep loss. Like other chronic inflammatory diseases, AD is immune-mediated and involves a complex interplay of immune cells and inflammatory cytokines.

BioLineRx Ltd. (NASDAQ: BLRX) (TASE:BLRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to its lead oncology candidate, BL-8040, for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
""Orphan Drug Designation in pancreatic cancer is a very important milestone in the development plan of BL-8040, and joins previously approved orphan designations by the FDA for BL-8040 in AML and stem-cell mobilization,"" stated Philip Serlin, Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx. ""Despite advances in the treatment of various cancers with immune checkpoint inhibitors, pancreatic cancer is refractory to these treatment options, and remains an area of significant unmet medical need. We have previously reported encouraging clinical data supporting the potential of BL-8040 as part of an immunotherapy combination treatment in pancreatic cancer, and we look forward to top-line results from our ongoing pancreatic clinical studies later this year.""
BL-8040 is currently being investigated in clinical studies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer under two separate immuno-oncology collaborations – one with Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), and a second collaboration with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group.
Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA entitles BioLineRx to seven years of market exclusivity for the use of BL-8040 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, if approved, plus significant development incentives, including tax credits related to clinical trial expenses, an exemption from the FDA-user fee, and FDA assistance in clinical trial design.
<b>About BL-8040</b>
BL-8040 is a short synthetic peptide for the treatment of hematological malignancies, solid tumors, and stem cell mobilization. It functions as a high-affinity best-in-class antagonist for CXCR4, a chemokine receptor that is directly involved in tumor progression, angiogenesis, metastasis and cell survival. CXCR4 is over-expressed in many human cancers and its expression often correlates with disease severity. In a number of clinical and pre-clinical studies, BL-8040 has shown robust mobilization of cancer cells and immune-cells, sensitization of cancer cells to chemo- and bio-based anti-cancer therapies, and direct anti-cancer effect by inducing programmed cell death (apoptosis). BL-8040 was licensed by BioLineRx from Biokine Therapeutics and was previously developed under the name BKT-140.
<b>About Pancreatic Cancer</b>
Pancreatic cancer has a low rate of early diagnosis and a poor prognosis. Its incidence rate in the U.S. is estimated at 3.2% of new cancer cases. Each year, about 185,000 individuals globally are diagnosed with this condition, and an estimated 55,000 individuals were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the U.S. during 2018. Symptoms are usually non-specific and as a result, pancreatic cancer is often not diagnosed until it reaches an advanced stage. Surgical resection does not offer adequate treatment since only 20% of patients have resectable tumors at the time of diagnosis. Even among patients who undergo resection for pancreatic cancer and have tumor-free margins, the five-year survival rate is only 10%-25%. The overall five-year survival rate among pancreatic cancer patients is 7-8%, which constitutes the highest mortality rate among solid tumor malignancies. The overall median survival is less than one year from diagnosis, highlighting the need for the development of new therapeutic options.
Despite advances in chemotherapeutics and immunotherapy, increases in median and overall survival rates in pancreatic cancer have been modest. Pancreatic cancer remains an area of unmet medical need, with no new approved therapies since the approval of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine (Abraxane<sup>®</sup>) for first-line treatment in 2013 and Onivyde<sup>®</sup> in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin for second-line treatment in 2015. The limited clinical benefits demonstrated by these existing standard treatment options reinforce the need for additional approaches.

INDIANAPOLIS, Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) and Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY) announced today that baricitinib met the primary endpoint in BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, two Phase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). In both investigational trials, compared to patients treated with placebo, a statistically significant proportion of patients treated with baricitinib achieved the primary endpoint at Week 16 defined by the Investigator's Global Assessment for AD (IGA) score of clear or almost clear (IGA 0,1). These are two of five studies that will be part of the placebo-controlled data program intended to support global registrations.
In the 16-week placebo-controlled phase of BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events with baricitinib treatment was similar to placebo, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events observed were nasopharyngitis and headache. No venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), or deaths were reported.
""Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can negatively impact the quality of life for patients, and unfortunately there are limited treatment options, particularly oral medications,"" said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. ""We are encouraged that baricitinib met the primary endpoints in these two studies, and look forward to seeing the collective results of all five studies.""
Lilly plans to share the full data results from both the BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 studies at future scientific venues and in peer-reviewed journals, as well as the topline data from other ongoing Phase 3 trials later this year.
Baricitinib is approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in more than 50 countries, including the U.S., member states of the EU and Japan, and is marketed as OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup>.
<b>Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients
</b>OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup> (baricitinib) 2 mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets</b><b> </b>
<b>WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS</b>
<b><i>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</i>: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.</b>
<b>Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.</b>
<b><i>MALIGNANCIES</i>: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.</b>
<b><i>THROMBOSIS</i>: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.</b>
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>
<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS: </b>The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>with chronic or recurrent infection</li>
 	<li>who have been exposed to TB</li>
 	<li>with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection</li>
 	<li>who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or</li>
 	<li>with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.</li>
</ul>
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.
<b>Tuberculosis </b>– Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.
<b>Viral Reactivation</b> – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.
The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.
<b>MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS:</b> Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.
<b>THROMBOSIS</b><b>:</b> Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.
<b>GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: </b>Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.
<b>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:
</b><b><i>Neutropenia</i></b> – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
<b><i>Lymphopenia</i></b> – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
<b><i>Anemia</i></b> – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to &lt;8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
<b><i>Liver Enzyme Elevations</i></b> – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to =5x and =10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.
Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.
<b><i>Lipid Elevations</i></b> – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.
<b>VACCINATIONS</b>: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.
<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</b>Adverse reactions (=1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%), and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.
<b>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
</b><b>PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: </b>No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.
<b>HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: </b>Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.

<b>About BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE AD-2
</b>The BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 clinical trials are multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib monotherapy in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Significant improvement in disease activity was determined by the proportion of patients on baricitinib achieving clear (0) or almost clear skin (1) with a greater than or equal to 2-point improvement as measured by the 5-point Investigator's Global Assessment for AD (IGA) scale at 16 weeks of treatment.
<b>About OLUMIANT
</b>OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies. There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known. OLUMIANT is approved in more than 50 countries.
<b>About Atopic Dermatitis
</b>Atopic dermatitis (AD), a serious form of eczema, is a chronic, relapsing skin disease characterized by intense itching, dry skin and inflammation that can be present on any part of the body. AD is a heterogeneous disease both clinically and biologically, but may be characterized by chronic baseline symptoms of itch, redness and skin damage that are often punctuated with episodic, sometimes unpredictable, flares or exacerbations. AD affects approximately 1-3 percent of adults worldwide.
Moderate-to-severe AD is characterized by intense itching, resulting in visibly damaged skin and sleep loss. Like other chronic inflammatory diseases, AD is immune-mediated and involves a complex interplay of immune cells and inflammatory cytokines.

AstraZeneca and its global biologics research and development arm, MedImmune, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for MEDI8897, an extended half-life respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F monoclonal antibody (mAb) being developed for the prevention of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by RSV.
A BTD is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and that have shown encouraging early clinical results, which may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically-significant endpoint over available medicines. MEDI8897 is being developed in partnership with Sanofi Pasteur and received Fast Track designation from the US FDA in March 2015.
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice-President, R&amp;D BioPharmaceuticals, said: “MEDI8897 is our next-generation preventive medicine for respiratory syncytial virus, which has the potential to address an important unmet need for infants, families and caregivers. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation, together with its recent PRIME eligibility from the European Medicines Agency, will help us to bring MEDI8897 to all infants at risk for RSV as quickly as possible.”
The BTD is based on the primary analysis of the <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02878330"" rel=""link-confirmation"">Phase IIb trial</a> to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MEDI8897, which met its primary endpoint defined as a statistically-significant reduction in the incidence of medically-attended LRTI caused by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed RSV, for 150 days after dosing in healthy preterm infants. Full results from the Phase IIb trial will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.
<b>About MEDI8897</b>
MEDI8897 is an extended half-life RSV F mAb being developed for the prevention of LRTI caused by RSV. MEDI8897 is being developed for use in a broader infant population than the current standard of care for RSV prevention, <i>Synagis</i> (palivizumab), which in the US is only approved for use in high-risk infants. Additionally, MEDI8897 is being developed so that it may only require one dose during a typical five-month RSV season, vs. monthly injections with current standard of care.<sup>1</sup>
The development programme for MEDI8897 also includes a Phase III trial in late preterm and healthy full-term infants. AstraZeneca will also conduct a Phase II/III study in <i>Synagis</i>-eligible paediatric patients to generate additional data for use in this population.

</ul>
<b>Basel, </b><b>-</b> Novartis announced today that it has entered into an agreement and plan of merger with AveXis, Inc. to acquire the US-based Nasdaq-listed clinical stage gene therapy company for USD 218 per share or a total of USD 8.7 billion in cash. The transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of both companies.
AveXis has several ongoing clinical studies for the treatment of SMA, an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a defect in a single gene, the survival motor neuron (SMN1). The lead AveXis gene therapy candidate, AVXS-101, has highly compelling clinical data in treating SMA Type 1, which is the number one genetic cause of death in infants, where 9 out of 10 infants do not live to their second birthday or are permanently ventilator dependent. It is estimated that one out of every 6,000-10,000 children born is affected by some form of SMA.
Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis, said: ""The proposed acquisition of AveXis offers an extraordinary opportunity to transform the care of SMA. We believe AVXS-101 could create a lifetime of possibilities for the children and families impacted by this devastating condition. The acquisition would also accelerate our strategy to pursue high-efficacy, first-in-class therapies and broaden our leadership in neuroscience. We would gain with the team at AveXis another gene therapy platform, in addition to our CAR-T platform for cancer, to advance a growing pipeline of gene therapies across therapeutic areas. We look forward on the closing of the deal to a smooth transition for AveXis employees and welcoming them to Novartis.""
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted AVXS-101 Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of SMA as well as Breakthrough Therapy designation for SMA Type 1. A BLA filing with the FDA for AVXS-101 is expected in the second half of 2018 and approval and launch in the US is expected in 2019. PRIME and Sakigake designations have been secured in Europe and Japan, respectively.
If approved, AVXS-101 would be a first-in-class one-time therapy that addresses the root genetic cause of SMA by effectively replacing the defective SMN1 gene. In a clinical study, AVXS-101 showed life-saving efficacy, with all 15 infants treated event free at 20 months compared with an event-free survival rate of 8 percent in an historical cohort (<i>NEJM</i>, November 2017). AveXis will also present two-year data to the American Academy of Neurology on April 25, 2018.
Paul Hudson, CEO Novartis Pharmaceuticals, said: ""Bringing AveXis on board would support both our ambition to be a leader in neurodegenerative diseases and our Neuroscience franchise priorities to strengthen our position in devastating pediatric neurological diseases such as SMA. We relish the opportunity to leverage our expertise, our 70-plus year heritage in neuroscience and our global footprint to help AVXS-101 benefit high-need SMA patients around the world.""
AveXis also offers state of the art AAV9 gene therapy manufacturing capabilities and valuable R&amp;D capabilities, which in addition to AVXS-101, includes other pipeline products for Rett Syndrome (RTT) and a genetic form of <em><b>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) </b></em>caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (<em><b>SOD1</b></em>) gene. AAV9 is considered to be a clinically proven gene delivery platform for diseases of the central nervous system (CNS).
Assuming mid 2018 completion, the acquisition impact would be slightly negative to Core Operating Income in 2018 and 2019, mainly due to R&amp;D investments. As of 2020, Novartis would expect the acquisition impact to strongly contribute to Core Operating Income and Core EPS accretion driven by a significant increase in sales.
The transaction is expected to close in mid 2018, pending the successful fulfilment of the tender offer and all other closing conditions. On completion, Novartis plans a smooth transition of operations and the integration of AveXis' talented and dedicated employees to continue the mission of bringing AVXS-101 to patients worldwide.
Conference calls for Investors will take place on Monday April 9, 2018 at 08:00 CET and 18:00 CET. Details can be found at <a href=""https://www.novartis.com/investors/event-calendar"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.novartis.com/investors/event-calendar</a>
<b>Transaction Details</b>
Under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, Novartis has formed an acquisition subsidiary, Novartis AM Merger Corporation (""<i>Purchaser</i>""), that will commence a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of AveXis for USD 218 per share.

</ul>
SUMMIT, N.J. &amp; SEATTLE–– Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) and Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:JUNO) today announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Juno. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will pay $87 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired and Juno shares already owned by Celgene (approximately 9.7% of outstanding shares). The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of both companies.
Juno is a pioneer in the development of CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T and TCR (T cell receptor) therapeutics with a broad, novel portfolio evaluating multiple targets and cancer indications. Adding to Celgene’s lymphoma program, JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) represents a potentially best-in-class CD19-directed CAR T currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Regulatory approval for JCAR017 in the U.S. is expected in 2019 with potential global peak sales of approximately $3 billion.
“The acquisition of Juno builds on our shared vision to discover and develop transformative medicines for patients with incurable blood cancers,” said Mark J. Alles, Celgene’s Chief Executive Officer. “Juno’s advanced cellular immunotherapy portfolio and research capabilities strengthen Celgene’s global leadership in hematology and adds new drivers for growth beyond 2020.”
“The people at Juno channel their passion for science and patients towards a common goal of finding cures by creating cell therapies that help people live longer, better lives,” said Hans Bishop, Juno’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Continuing this work will take scientific prowess, manufacturing excellence and global reach. This union will provide all three.”
The acquisition will also add a novel scientific platform and scalable manufacturing capabilities which will complement Celgene’s leadership in hematology and oncology. In collaboration with Juno’s team in Seattle, Celgene plans to expand its existing center of excellence for immuno-oncology translational medicine by leveraging Juno’s research and development facility in Seattle, WA as well as Juno’s manufacturing facility in Bothell, WA.
<b>Strategic Rationale for Acquiring Juno</b>
Upon completion of the acquisition of Juno, Celgene will be positioned to become a preeminent cellular immunotherapy company. The strategic advantages of this acquisition will include the opportunity to:
<ul>
 	<li>Leverage a novel scientific platform and scalable manufacturing capabilities to position Celgene at the forefront of future advances in the science of cellular immunotherapy</li>
 	<li>Accelerate Juno’s pipeline development to capture the full potential of cellular immunotherapy
<ul>
 	<li>JCAR017, a pivotal stage asset, with an emerging favorable profile in DLBCL, is expected to add approximately $3 billion in peak sales and significantly strengthen Celgene’s lymphoma portfolio</li>
 	<li>JCARH125 will enhance Celgene’s campaign against BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), a key target in multiple myeloma</li>
 	<li>Additional cellular therapy assets in proof-of-concept trials for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors will add to Celgene’s existing pipeline</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Accelerate revenue diversification with meaningful growth drivers beyond 2020</li>
 	<li>Capture 100% of the global economics on all Juno’s cellular immunotherapy assets</li>
</ul>
<b>Terms of the Agreement</b>
Celgene will acquire all the outstanding shares of common stock of Juno through a tender offer for $87 per share in cash, or an aggregate of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired and Juno shares already owned by Celgene. The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of a number of shares of Juno common stock, that when taken together with the shares of Juno common stock already directly and indirectly owned by Celgene, represent at least a majority of outstanding shares of Juno common stock, and expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The transaction is anticipated to close in Q1:18.
Celgene expects to fund the transaction through a combination of existing cash and new debt. The resulting capital structure will be consistent with Celgene’s historical financial strategy and strong investment grade profile providing the financial flexibility to pursue Celgene’s strategic priorities and take actions to drive post 2020 growth.
The acquisition is expected to be dilutive to adjusted EPS (earnings per share) in 2018 by approximately $0.50 and is expected to be incrementally additive to net product sales in 2020. There is no change to the previously disclosed 2020 financial targets of total net product sales of $19 billion to $20 billion and adjusted EPS greater than $12.50.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor to Celgene on the transaction. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC is acting as financial advisor to Juno. Legal counsel for Celgene is Proskauer Rose LLP and Hogan Lovells, and Juno’s legal counsel is Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, LLP.

<div class=""component-content"">
<strong>Paris (France) and Waltham, Mass. –</strong> – Sanofi and Bioverativ Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders, have entered into a definitive agreement under which Sanofi will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Bioverativ for $105 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $11.6 billion (on a fully diluted basis). The transaction was unanimously approved by both the Sanofi and Bioverativ Boards of Directors.
<i>“With Bioverativ, a leader in the growing hemophilia market, Sanofi enhances its presence in specialty care and leadership in rare diseases, in line with its 2020 Roadmap, and creates a platform for growth in other rare blood disorders. Together, we have a great opportunity to bring innovative medicines to patients worldwide, building on Bioverativ’s success in driving new standards of care with its extended half-life factor replacement therapies,” commented Olivier Brandicourt, Sanofi’s Chief Executive Officer. “Combined, we will continue to leverage our scientific know-how, disciplined focus and development expertise that best position us to drive value for our shareholders and create breakthrough treatments for patients.”</i>
Bioverativ Chief Executive Officer, John Cox, noted, “Bioverativ was created to bring meaningful progress to people living with hemophilia and other rare blood disorders, and I am extremely proud of the accomplishments we’ve made toward that mission over the past year. We have expanded upon the success of Eloctate and Alprolix, which are making a difference in the lives of people with hemophilia every day, and built a pipeline of novel programs for people with rare blood disorders. Sanofi brings proven capabilities and a global infrastructure, which we believe will help to more rapidly expand access to our medicines globally and further our mission of transforming the lives of people with rare blood disorders. Our Chairman, Brian Posner, our entire Board and I strongly believed our spin-off would create meaningful value for shareholders, and this transaction delivers tremendous value for the shareholders who have invested in and supported our mission.”
<strong>Creating a Leading Hemophilia Portfolio</strong>
With approximately $10 billion in annual sales and 181,000[2] people affected worldwide, hemophilia represents the largest market for rare diseases and is expected to grow above 7%[3] per year through 2022. Treatment options for patients are shaped by shifting standards of care worldwide and include prophylaxis and extended half-life products, and the development and adoption of innovative therapies.
Bioverativ’s extended half-life therapies, Eloctate® [Antihemophilic Factor VIII (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein] and Alprolix® [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein] for the treatment of hemophilia A and B, respectively, represented the first major advancements in the hemophilia market in nearly two decades when launched. In 2016, Bioverativ generated $847 million in sales and $41 million in royalties.
Bioverativ currently markets the two products in the United States, Japan, Canada and Australia, and plans to expand into additional geographies. The therapies are also commercialized in the European Union and other countries under a collaboration agreement.
Sanofi believes factor replacement therapy will remain the standard of care in hemophilia for many years due to excellent safety and its increasingly superior long-acting profile. Sanofi will be able to leverage Bioverativ’s clinical expertise and existing commercial platform to advance fitusiran, an investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic for hemophilia A and B, with or without inhibitors. Sanofi recently announced a restructuring of its rare disease alliance with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, with Sanofi obtaining global development and commercialization rights to fitusiran.
<strong>Strengthening Sanofi’s Specialty Care Portfolio</strong>
One of the priorities of Sanofi’s 2020 roadmap is to “Reshape the Portfolio” and focus on areas where the company currently has, or can effectively build, a leadership position. The addition of Bioverativ supports this priority by adding to our portfolio a differentiated offering of innovative therapies and providing a platform for growth in rare blood disorders, which will expand our presence in specialty care, further strengthen our leadership position in rare diseases and meet the needs of the patient community.
Beyond its two marketed products, Bioverativ’s pipeline includes a program in Phase 3 testing for cold agglutinin disease, and early stage research programs and collaborations in hemophilia, and other rare blood disorders, including sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Sanofi’s R&amp;D organization will support Bioverativ in bringing these important therapies to patients faster. Furthermore, Sanofi’s global presence, proven expertise and success in launching specialty medicines, and established footprint in key emerging markets will help Bioverativ fully capitalize on growth opportunities for Bioverativ’s current and future products.
<strong>Delivering Shareholder Value</strong>
The addition of Bioverativ is expected to drive meaningful value for Sanofi’s shareholders, with strong cash flows from Bioverativ’s growing products expected to increase Sanofi’s financial and operational scale. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Sanofi’s Business EPS in FY2018 and up to 5% accretive in FY2019. Sanofi is also projected to achieve ROIC in excess of cost of capital within three years. Sanofi expects to preserve its strong credit rating.
<strong>Transaction Terms</strong>
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Bioverativ common stock at a price of $105 per share in cash. The $105 per share acquisition price represents a 64 percent premium to Bioverativ’s closing price on January 19, 2018.
The consummation of the tender offer is subject to various conditions, including the tender of at least a majority of the outstanding Bioverativ shares, redelivery of a tax opinion delivered at signing, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and receipt of certain other regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. Following the successful completion of the tender offer, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi will merge with Bioverativ and the outstanding Bioverativ shares not tendered in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive the same $105 per share in cash paid in the tender offer. The tender offer is expected to commence in February 2018.
Sanofi plans to finance the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and through new debt to be raised. The tender offer is not subject to any financing condition. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close within three months.
Lazard is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Sanofi. Guggenheim Securities and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are acting as financial advisors to Bioverativ. Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP is serving as legal counsel to Sanofi. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP is serving as legal counsel to Bioverativ.
<strong>Conference Call</strong>
Sanofi will host a webcast live on Sanofi’s website at 2:00 pm CET/8:00 am EST on Monday, January 22, 2018. The webcast details and full presentation will be made available on Sanofi’s Investor Relations webpage.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","SUMMIT, N.J.—-Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) today announced that it has received a Refusal to File letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its New Drug Application (NDA) for ozanimod in development for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Ozanimod is a novel, oral, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 (S1PR1) and 5 (S1PR5) receptor modulator
Upon its preliminary review, the FDA determined that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were insufficient to permit a complete review. Celgene intends to seek immediate guidance, including requesting a Type A meeting with the FDA, to ascertain what additional information will be required to resubmit the NDA.“We remain confident in ozanimod’s clinical profile demonstrated in the pivotal program in relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis,” said Jay Backstrom, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Regulatory Affairs for Celgene. “We will work with the FDA to expeditiously address all outstanding items and bring this important medicine to patients.”
Conference Call Information
Celgene will hold a conference call to discuss this update today at 5:30 p.m. ET. The conference call may be accessed by dialing 1-866-428-9517 for U.S. callers and 1-224-357-2194 for international callers. The passcode for the call is 9179457.

About Ozanimod
Ozanimod is a novel, oral, selective, sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 (S1PR1) and 5 (S1PR5) receptor modulator in development for immune-inflammatory indications, including relapsing multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Selective binding with S1PR1 is believed to inhibit a specific sub set of activated lymphocytes from migrating to sites of inflammation. The result is a reduction of circulating T and B lymphocytes that leads to anti-inflammatory activity. Importantly, immune surveillance is maintained.
Selective binding with S1PR5 is thought to activate specific cells within the central nervous system (CNS). This has the potential to enhance remyelination and prevent synaptic defects. Ultimately, neurological damage may be prevented.
Ozanimod is an investigational compound that is not approved for any use in any country.
About Celgene
Celgene Corporation, headquartered in Summit, New Jersey, is an integrated global pharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation.

GlaxoSmithKline plc today announces a major 3-part inter-conditional transaction with Novartis AG involving its Consumer Healthcare, Vaccines and Oncology businesses (the “Transaction”). In summary:
<ul>
 	<li>GSK and Novartis will create a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare business with 2013 pro forma revenues of £6.5 billion. GSK will have majority control with an equity interest of 63.5%</li>
 	<li>GSK will acquire Novartis’ global Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) for an initial cash consideration of $5.25 billion with subsequent potential milestone payments of up to $1.8 billion and ongoing royalties</li>
 	<li>GSK will divest its marketed Oncology portfolio, related R&amp;D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitor and also grant of commercialisation partner rights for future oncology products to Novartis for an aggregate cash consideration of $16 billion (of which up to $1.5 billion depends on the results of the COMBI-d trial)</li>
 	<li>GSK shareholders to receive £4 billion capital return funded by net cash transaction proceeds and expected to be delivered via a B share scheme</li>
 	<li>Transaction expected to be accretive to core EPS from first year, reflecting execution of intended B share scheme, and thereafter with growing contribution from 2017 as projected cost savings and new growth opportunities are delivered</li>
 	<li>Transaction is expected to complete during the first half of 2015 subject to approvals</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sir Andrew Witty, Chief Executive Officer, GSK said:  </strong>
“This proposed 3-part transaction accelerates our strategy to generate sustainable, broadly sourced sales growth and improve long-term earnings.
“Opportunities to build greater scale and combine high quality assets in Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare are scarce. With this transaction we will substantially strengthen two of our core businesses and create significant new options to increase value for shareholders.
“The Novartis OTC portfolio is highly complementary to GSK’s and has many well-known, widely recommended brands such as Voltaren<em>, </em>Excedrin, Otrivin<em>, </em>andTheraflu. Together, we will create the world’s premier OTC business with clear opportunities to accelerate revenue growth.
“The acquisition of Novartis’ Vaccines business will significantly enhance the breadth of our vaccines portfolio and pipeline, notably in meningitis, with the addition of Bexsero, an exciting new vaccine for prevention of meningitis B. The acquisition will also strengthen our manufacturing network and reduce supply costs.
“The third part of this transaction would see divestment of our Oncology portfolio to Novartis.  Over the last six years we have made excellent progress to develop a series of innovative medicines. This transaction provides us with a unique opportunity to crystallise an attractive value for this portfolio and allow these medicines to benefit from Novartis’ global scale in this area.
In financial terms, this transaction significantly exceeds our return criteria and delivers accretion to core earnings per share in year one and then with a growing contribution over time, particularly in 2017, as growth opportunities and projected cost savings are delivered.
“We also expect to return £4 billion to shareholders following completion of this transaction, whilst maintaining a strong capital base and our commitment to increasing dividends.
“Finally, and very importantly, this transaction strengthens GSK’s offering to patients and consumers. We will expand our portfolio to both help treat illness and prevent disease, and we will broaden our scope to improve human health with the acquired R&amp;D and innovation expertise.”
<strong>Strategic highlights</strong>
<strong><em>Balanced set of core businesses and strengthened R&amp;D</em></strong>
The proposed Transaction would increase GSK’s annual revenues by £1.3 billion to £26.9 billion (on a 2013 pro forma basis) and fundamentally re-shape GSK’s revenue base. These revenues would be split across Pharmaceuticals 62%, Consumer Healthcare 24% and Vaccines 14%.
Following completion, around 70% of GSK’s revenues would be focussed around four key franchises: Respiratory, HIV (ViiV Healthcare), Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. All of these franchises operate in growing markets with new and market-leading brands and products manufactured in protected technologies.
Of the remaining revenue base, approximately 14% of sales would reside in GSK’s Established Products Portfolio (EPP). GSK is currently reviewing this portfolio to ensure the Group evaluates all options to maximise its value.
As a result of this transaction, GSK’s late-stage development pipeline would be further strengthened with the addition of 4 new candidate vaccines from Novartis. In total, GSK would have around 45 NMEs in Phase II/III clinical development. In Consumer Healthcare, both GSK and Novartis have strong track-records of brand innovation and creating scientifically differentiated products with ~15% of combined sales generated from innovation launched in recent years.
<strong><em>Creating a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare business</em></strong>
Following completion of the transaction, GSK will be a global leader in Consumer Healthcare with revenues of £6.5 billion, on a 2013 pro forma basis. The new business will hold category leading positions and brands in Wellness, Oral health, Nutrition and Skin health, combining OTC and FMCG capabilities and expertise.
In Wellness, the new combination’s £3.4 billion complementary portfolio will create the world’s largest OTC business with the leading position in more than 35 countries around the world.
The combination is geographically well-matched. Novartis’ portfolio has had relatively limited exposure to high growth emerging markets and this presents multiple new growth opportunities for several major brands and innovations, notably Voltaren, Excedrin and Otrivin. Similarly, GSK’s brands would benefit from exposure to Novartis’ highly successful CIS, Central and Eastern European business.
The combination also creates a more competitive business.<strong>  </strong>With leading positions in most of the categories in which it operates, the combination will have excellent customer insight and ability to offer retailers better shopper experiences. The combination will also have significant mass market, pharmacy and expert selling capabilities with sales personnel throughout the world. The business will also have access to world-leading science capabilities and to new Rx/Cx switch opportunities from both parent companies.
Emma Walmsley has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer Designate of the new business and will be a member of its Board. Sir Andrew Witty will be Chairman of the Board. The Board will comprise directors from both GSK and Novartis.
<strong><em>Strengthening global leadership in Vaccines</em></strong>
The acquisition of Novartis’ global Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) further improves GSK’s position as the world’s leading global vaccines supplier. Demand for vaccination remains significant with the global vaccine market projected to grow approximately 10% per annum over the next 10 years.
The transaction will strengthen the breadth of GSK’s portfolio, notably in meningitis, including the addition of Bexsero, a new vaccine for prevention of meningitis B and a further candidate vaccine in late-stage development, MenABCWY.
This portfolio expansion will be of benefit to GSK in all markets and notably in the USA, where Novartis has a strong track record of delivery. GSK’s significant presence in emerging and developing markets will also provide new opportunities for introduction and growth of Novartis’ vaccines.
GSK and Novartis’ Vaccines R&amp;D organisations are highly complementary, bringing together respective expertise in virology, bacterial infection and different adjuvant platforms. The new business would have more than 20 different vaccines in development, including assets to prevent hospital and maternal infections and diseases prevalent in developing countries such as malaria and tuberculosis.
The acquisition is expected to strengthen GSK’s manufacturing network and increase overall capacity, notably with the addition of Novartis’ secondary packaging and supply facilities in Rosia, Italy and Marburg, Germany. GSK would also acquire new manufacturing sites in India and China. In addition, the integration of the supply of a number of key antigens, currently provided to GSK by Novartis, will provide immediate improvements and enhance the future flexibility of the business, particularly in paediatric vaccines.
<strong><em>Realising value for Oncology </em></strong>
GSK has agreed to divest its marketed Oncology portfolio, related R&amp;D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitor and also grant commercialisation partner rights for future oncology products to Novartis for an aggregate cash consideration of $16 billion. Up to $1.5 billion of this amount depends on the results of the COMBI-d trial, a Phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of Tafinlar (BRAF) and Mekinist (MEK) versus BRAF monotherapy.
For GSK, this part of the Transaction represents a unique opportunity to crystallise an attractive value for its marketed portfolio and provide Novartis with the opportunity to leverage its global scale in this therapy area and deliver new growth and development opportunities for these products.
GSK’s R&amp;D in oncology will continue with programmes to investigate potential new treatments in areas of cancer immunotherapy, epigenetics, and tumour environment.
<strong>Financial implications</strong>
<strong><em>Sales and earnings benefits</em></strong>
The proposed Transaction significantly exceeds GSK’s returns criteria and the company expects to realise benefits to sales and earnings as a result of it. The Transaction would increase overall GSK revenues by £1.3 billion to £26.9 billion, on a 2013 pro forma basis.
The Transaction is expected to be accretive to core earnings per share from the first year, reflecting the execution of the intended B share scheme, and is expected to make a growing contribution to earnings thereafter, especially from 2017, as the delivery of cost savings, new product launches and re-introduction of Novartis’ OTC products accelerates. GSK’s operating margins would reflect changes to GSK’s revenue mix which result from the Transaction.
New revenue growth opportunities are expected in both Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare as a result of the Transaction and future revenues would also reflect the benefits from recent restructuring and investment by Novartis. In Consumer Healthcare, sales would reflect the re-supply of certain products manufactured at Novartis’ facility in Lincoln, Nebraska following remediation activities at the site. Production and re-supply of these products is expected to increase and be phased in over the next 2 years.
<strong><em>Cost savings</em></strong>
GSK estimates that total annual cost savings of £1 billion could be achievable by the fifth full year following closing. The delivery of these potential savings is expected to be phased with approximately 50% delivered by year three and the full amount by year five. GSK intends to reinvest approximately 20% of cost savings to support innovation and expected new product launches across the Group, wherever returns are most attractive.
Total costs to deliver these savings are estimated to be £2 billion, split approximately evenly between cash and non-cash charges.
Contributions to the total cost savings are estimated to be approximately 40% from Consumer Healthcare, 40% from Vaccines and 20% from savings associated with the divestment of GSK’s Oncology portfolio. These estimates are subject to further detailed implementation planning post closing.
Potential cost savings would be generated from reductions in selling and administrative costs, removal of infrastructure overlaps and reduced third party contracting as well as through improvements in manufacturing costs. The new GSK businesses would also expect to benefit from new economies of scale and earn greater returns from leveraging sales, distribution and purchasing opportunities across its broader global platform.
The companies will conduct consultations on cost savings proposals with staff, works councils, trade unions and other employee representatives in line with local practice and in accordance with applicable employment legislation.
<strong>Shareholder information</strong>
<strong><em>Approvals </em></strong>
The Transaction constitutes a Class 1 transaction for the purposes of the FCA’s Listing Rules and therefore is conditional upon the approval of GSK’s shareholders at a General Meeting which is expected to be held in the fourth quarter of 2014.  The Transaction is also conditional upon other matters, including receiving certain anti-trust approvals. Completion of the Transaction is anticipated to occur during the first half of 2015.
<strong><em>Capital return</em></strong>
GSK plans to use net after tax cash proceeds of $7.8 billion to fund a capital return of £4 billion to shareholders following completion of the transaction. This return is expected to be implemented through a B share scheme in 2015, subject to approvals. Specific details related to the execution of the B share scheme will be sent to shareholders in due course.
Following implementation of the B share scheme, GSK would not make any further share repurchases in 2015 but will review the potential for future share buy backs from 2016 in line with its usual annual cycle and subject to its current return and rating criteria.

<strong>GlaxoSmithKline plc - Proposed 3-part transaction with Novartis</strong>
<strong>Introduction </strong>
GSK today announces that it has reached agreement with Novartis on a major 3-part transaction involving its Consumer Healthcare and Oncology businesses and Novartis’ Vaccines and OTC (over-the-counter) Consumer Healthcare businesses.
The Transaction with Novartis comprises three inter-conditional components, consisting of:
(i)             the creation of a Consumer Healthcare joint venture (JV), combining GSK’s Consumer Healthcare business and Novartis’ OTC Consumer Healthcare business (the “Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture”);
(ii)            the acquisition by GSK of Novartis’ global Vaccines Business, including its meningitis portfolio and antigen manufacturing facilities, but excluding influenza vaccines (the “Vaccines Acquisition”); and
(i)             the divestment of GSK’s marketed Oncology portfolio, related R&amp;D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitor and the grant of commercialisation partner rights for future oncology products to Novartis (the “Oncology Disposal”).
<strong>Summary of principal terms and conditions of the Transaction</strong>
This section provides information about the material terms and conditions of the Transaction, its constituent parts and the agreements entered into today by GSK and Novartis in that regard. Payment terms have been agreed in US dollars ($).
<strong><em>Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture</em></strong>
GSK and Novartis have today entered into contribution agreements under which, upon completion of the Transaction, GSK and Novartis will create the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture to hold GSK’s Consumer Healthcare business and Novartis’ OTC Consumer Healthcare business. In consideration of these contributions, GSK will have a controlling 63.5% equity interest in the joint venture company, with Novartis’ interest being 36.5%.
The JV will operate under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name and would operate in all territories where GSK and Novartis have a presence in those businesses, with the exception of India and Nigeria where GSK will continue to hold directly its interests in its listed subsidiaries.
The JV will be consolidated in GSK’s financial statements and will have no external debt.
GSK will assume control of Novartis’ OTC manufacturing network. This includes Novartis’ facility in Lincoln, Nebraska. Remedial actions to address the manufacturing issues identified at the Nebraska site have been underway since 2012 and re-supply of certain products started in November 2013. At present it is not possible to determine when the site will resume full operations. Production and re-supply of products is expected to increase and be phased over the next 2 years.
The joint venture is the subject of a shareholders’ agreement between GSK and Novartis, under which GSK will have 7 directors and Novartis 4 directors on the board of the joint venture company. GSK will have control of the joint venture company through the board, while Novartis will enjoy customary minority shareholder protections.
Novartis has the right to exit its investment in the joint venture company via a put option to GSK at an expert-determined market valuation.  The put option is exercisable in certain windows in the period from the third to the twentieth anniversary of closing of the Transaction. The put option may be exercised either in respect of Novartis’ entire holding in the joint venture company at any given point or in instalments of 7.5% (with a final instalment of 14%).   If the put option is exercised in instalments, a waiting period of 18 months applies between option exercises.
GSK and Novartis are subject to restrictions regarding the transfer of their respective interests in the joint venture company to third parties.  As an exception to these restrictions, Novartis will be free to sell its shares to a third party (subject to GSK’s right of first refusal) following expiry of the put option arrangements described above.  In addition, GSK is free to sell its shares to a third party following the third anniversary of closing of the Transaction, subject to Novartis having a right of first refusal and a tag right entitling it to require its shares to be sold as part of any sale by GSK.
<strong><em>Vaccines Acquisition</em></strong>
GSK and Novartis have today entered into a share and business sale agreement under which, upon completion of the Transaction, Novartis’ global Vaccines Business (including relevant corporate entities but excluding influenza vaccines) will be sold to GSK.
The consideration payable by GSK under this agreement comprises:
(i)             $5.25 billion payable at closing (which is subject to customary adjustment for levels of cash, debt and working capital);
(ii)            the following pipeline-related milestone payments:
(a)  $450 million upon FDA regulatory approval for Novartis’ MenABCWY vaccine product;
(b)  $450 million in the event that Bexsero achieves an agreed annual net sales threshold;
(c)  $450 million upon achievement of an agreed milestone relating to ACIP regulatory recommendations in respect of either Novartis’ MenABCWY vaccine product or Bexsero; and
(d)   $450 million upon achievement of an agreed milestone relating to ACIP regulatory recommendations in respect of Novartis’ Group B streptococcus vaccine (“GBS”); and
(iii)           annual royalty payments at the rate of 10% on certain net sales of the above products.
<strong><em>Oncology Disposal</em></strong>
GSK and Novartis have today entered into a sale agreement under which GSK has agreed to sell, upon completion of the Transaction, the rights to GSK’s currently marketed oncology portfolio, related R&amp;D activities and its AKT inhibitor currently in development as well as to grant Novartis preferred partner rights for future commercialisation of GSK oncology products for an aggregate cash consideration of $16 billion. Up to $1.5 billion of this cash consideration depends on the results of the COMBI-d trial, a Phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of Tafinlar (BRAF) and Mekinist (MEK) versus BRAF monotherapy.
COMBI-d is a Phase III trial studying the combination of BRAF/MEK in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, as compared to BRAF monotherapy. The trial reported positive progression free survival (primary endpoint) data in January 2014, and is being continued to evaluate its secondary endpoint of overall survival. The data on overall survival is estimated to read out in late 2014 or early 2015.
GSK will enter into a manufacturing supply agreement for the transferred products with Novartis for an initial period of 5 years.
The cash consideration is subject to customary adjustment for levels of working capital.
GSK will retain its early-stage R&amp;D pipeline and discovery capability, as well as certain product rights outside of oncology for Arzerra.
The preferred partner rights granted by GSK to Novartis are for a period of 12.5 years from closing of the Transaction and relate to co-development and commercialisation opportunities relating to GSK oncology development products.
<strong><em>Inter-conditionality and Long-stop date</em></strong>
The Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture, the Vaccines Acquisition and the Oncology Disposal are inter-conditional.  As such, none of the Transaction’s constituent parts will close unless the conditions to the other parts are satisfied or, where applicable, waived.  The various conditions to the Transaction and its constituent parts must be satisfied (or, where applicable, waived) within 18 months (or such other date as GSK and Novartis may agree).  If that does not occur, the Transaction will terminate.
<strong><em>Conditions to completion </em></strong>
The Transaction constitutes a Class 1 transaction for the purposes of the FCA’s Listing Rules and is therefore conditional upon the approval of GSK’s shareholders at a General Meeting. Until such time as the Transaction is approved by GSK’s shareholders, the Transaction is also conditional upon the Novartis Board not withdrawing approval of the Transaction that it has announced today.
GSK has agreed that its Board will recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the resolution approving the Transaction at the General Meeting (the “GSK Recommendation”).  The Novartis Board has today approved the Transaction as being in the best interests of Novartis and its shareholders as a whole (the “Novartis Approval”).  The GSK Recommendation and the Novartis Approval are both subject to provisions that allow them to be withdrawn on account of fiduciary duties.
In addition, the Transaction and its constituent parts are subject to certain other conditions, including the following material conditions:
·         the receipt of anti-trust clearances by GSK and Novartis in respect of the constituent parts of the Transaction, including EU merger clearance and expiry of the HSR waiting periods;
·         no material adverse event in relation to the businesses of either GSK or Novartis which are part of the Transaction; and
·         certain other regulatory matters and approvals and certain third party consents.
GSK and Novartis will also conduct consultations with staff, works councils and trade unions and other employee representatives as appropriate and in accordance with applicable requi",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GSK.jpg,M&A,GSK|Novartis,,M&A|Build|Collaborate|Consumer|Healthcare|Joint Venture|Pfizer,publish,22-4-2018,2,,,,,,,,,
