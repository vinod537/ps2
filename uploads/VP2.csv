36674,ViewPoints Article: Immunity &amp; Pregnancy: Unique and Complex,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pregnancy is one of the most exciting and happy experiences in a woman’s life. Taking care of the mother and baby is essential throughout the pregnancy.&nbsp; During this period, the immune system is naturally suppressed so that the mother's body does not reject the baby and can accommodate the growing fetus. Attack by virus/bacteria or any other pathogen during such a sensitive period is an unfavourable situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pregnant women are said to be more prone to diseases and infections, so an expecting mother must do everything it takes to have excellent immunity. An expecting mother with weak immunity is at risk for infections and other conditions mentioned in the figure below.</p>

<p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>Unwanted negative effects of low immunity during pregnancy</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Increased Demand for Macronutrients &amp; Micronutrients</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During pregnancy, a woman’s macronutrient and micronutrient intake need to grow significantly. Not only the mother, but the fetus also requires them. Macronutrients including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are needed for the proper growth of the fetus. Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals in smaller quantities. When these are not supplied in adequate quantity, pregnant women have a higher risk of falling sick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How a Viral Infection Affects the Fetus and the Pregnancy Outcome</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Viral infections that can reach the fetus by crossing the placenta might have a dangerous outcome. Even in the absence of placental transmission, the fetus could be adversely affected by the maternal immune response to the infection. There is a paucity of evidence that viral infections lead to preterm labour. Strong clinical data is indicating that children of mothers exposed to certain infectious microorganisms during pregnancy have a significantly higher risk of neurological disorders (including psychiatric disorders).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pregnancy &amp; Immunity</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In general, our immune system is like a barrier – it protects us from illness, germs, and toxins by providing resistance to those infections. Without the body`s defence mechanism the functioning of organs and overall health can be compromised. During pregnancy, the expecting mother’s immune system is rapidly changing. The maternal immune system plays a critical role in establishing, maintaining, and completing a healthy pregnancy. There is a modulation of the immune system which leads to differential responses depending not only on the type of bacteria/virus or fungi but on the stage of the pregnancy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strengthen Immunity to Maintain Healthy Pregnancy:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Moderate physical activity</li><li>Stay hydrated</li><li>Reduce stress</li><li>Get enough sleep</li><li>Eat a nutritious diet</li><li>Dietary or supplemented intake of essential micronutrients.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Should All Pregnant Women Take Supplements?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All pregnant women have prescribed supplements such as folic acid, vitamins, and iron but those suffering from the following need additional supplementation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Nutrient deficiency</li><li>Nausea &amp; vomiting</li><li>Dietary restrictions</li><li>Multiple pregnancies</li><li>Poor diet</li><li>Genetic mutations</li><li>Pre-eclampsia</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4. Iron</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During pregnancy, the mother supplies blood and oxygen to the fetus, so the demand for iron becomes twice as before to keep up with the increase in blood supply.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Magnesium</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For maintaining a healthy gut and may reduce the risk of some infections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To conclude, pregnancy is a dynamic state; with different mechanisms of immunity varying on the stage of pregnancy. Fighting infections and strengthening immunity is important during such a sensitive period. Nutraceuticals provide the prevention or treatment of diseases through dietary supplementation. These become highly important during pregnancy to prevent conditions secondary to nutrient deficiency. The most well-known nutritional supplements regularly prescribed in pregnancy include folic acid, iron, calcium, Vitamin D, iodine, zinc, selenium, magnesium, and also vitamin C for pregnancy and lactating mothers.</p>

46760,ViewPoints Article: Medical Representatives Opinion Survey for Business Continuity with New Normal,,"<p></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p><strong>K. K. Consulting Services</strong> has conducted this survey by contacting around 2200 medical representatives across the India using google forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
</p>
<h4>Objective of&nbsp; Survey</h4><h4>The purpose of this survey is to design a platform for pharmaceutical sales professionals (PSP) to share their opinion about business continuity challenges faced by them due to the present COVID pandemic situation. The nature of the job for Pharmaceutical sales professionals is primarily field sales, which is meeting doctors and promoting medicines of companies and generating new business. Due to corona risk, field sales have become more challenging, and going out of the house may not be safe. Moreover, doctors are not finding it safe to meet pharmaceutical sales professionals to avoid the risk of corona infections to patients as well as hospital/clinic staff and from staff/patients to PSP’s.<br></h4>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>With these challenges, there is pressure from company/reporting managers to work in the field and meet doctors for generating more business. Some companies are taking adequate measures for PSP’s to protect them from infection.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>Understanding these circumstances, what is the opinion of Pharmaceutical Sales Professionals? How are they ensuring business process continuity? Are they willing to work in the field by taking risk of their health? For questions like these and more, this survey aims to seek opinion with the response to MCQ’s. The aim is also to give support to the voice of Pharmaceutical Sales Professionals by bringing it to the notice of key stakeholders of the Pharmaceutical Industry</p>

<h4>Methodology of&nbsp; Survey</h4>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>This survey was conducted by the circulating link of Google Forms using social media. Participants had to choose the response from the given options and submit the form. It was a set of 11 questions with respect to survey title and demographic details. We compiled the information generated from participants and published it. No personal information is collected from any participant.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
</p>
<h4>Outcome of Survey</h4>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>Around 50% of survey participants have more than 10 years of professional experience and around 59% of total participants are working as team managers. This shows that the opinion shared by participants who have a good understanding of the business process and customer connects. (n=2206)</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:list -->
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending messages over ""WhatsApp"" was a preferred way of keeping in touch with doctors, Call doctors and promoting products was the 2nd preference. Surprisingly around 22% of PSPs choose not to keep any engagements at all with doctors.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:list -->
</p>
<ul>
<li>75% of participants feel that it will take around 0-6 months’ time to start sales call like it was happening before COVID 19 pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:list -->
</p>
<ul>
<li>Successful engagement with doctors with the help of online tools is a long-standing task for the pharmaceutical industry, due to the corona pandemic, companies are not left with any other option other than trying this. Perhaps all these initiatives are implemented in a hurry and therefore poor response is observed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:list -->
</p>
<ul>
<li>To maintain engagement with doctors, many companies conducted webinar/Facebook live events for sharing knowledge. In the survey, it is found that the effectiveness of such meetings was poor. 70% of participants feel that it’s not effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:list -->
</p>
<ul>
<li>The productivity of such meetings is also not seen; 78% of participants feel that online webinar/FB engagements do not have positive impact on business growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:list -->
</p>
<ul>
<li>60% PSP’s suggested that they are pressurized by reporting manager/company to go in the field and meet doctors. This pressure is observed most at 63% in the east zone and least at 57% in the west zone. Team managers across India felt more pressure then Medical Representatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p></p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:list -->
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of losing a job due to COVID 19 pandemic was also observed, 72% of PSP’s voted for it. Team managers have more fear then Medical Representatives. If this of losing a job is divided among 4 zones, then it’s observed less in the south at 69% and most at North and East zones at 74%</li>

61586,ViewPoints Article: Nutraceuticals Under Evaluation for COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pandemic has led to the identification of some promising nutraceuticals for the management and prevention of Covid-19. Nutraceuticals with their immune-boosting potential can “amplify the body's defense system” against the virus. For the past numerous decades, the medicinal action of natural compounds has gained focus as an alternate or adjuvant therapy approach in treating several diseases. Alongside bioactive substances contained in foods and natural substances are coined as nutraceuticals, show health benefits especially in the treatment of chronic illness. Nutraceuticals, obtained from natural sources have the advantage of negligible side effects when compared with other conventional drug therapies. This attracts consumers to lean on using nutraceuticals.<sup>1</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nutraceuticals are supplements with health benefits beyond their nutritional value. The use of nutraceuticals is not only for dietary supplementation but also aids in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of an illness or disorder. Considering this some nutraceuticals have exhibited therapeutic and preventive potential. They have been linked with antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities and prevention from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The main nutraceuticals that are under evaluation for their potential preventive and treatment applications include omega-3 fatty acid, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D, selenium.<sup>2</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li><strong><u>Omega-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acid (N-3 PUFA):</u></strong></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It contains eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Dietary intake of fish or another source of dietary supplementation with fish oil can fulfill the requirements of EPA and DHA. N-3 PUFA has a good medicinal effect against diseases that cause inflammation. It mediates inflammation by influencing processes like adhesion molecule expression and the production of eicosanoids.2 N-3 PUFA also suppresses the synthesis of immunoglobulin E, leading to reduced airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction in patients. Consumption of cod liver oil (contains EPA+vit A) leads to a decrease in complications associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Although these benefits of effective reduction in airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction, their potential use against covid-19 needs further investigation.<sup>3</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. <strong><u>Zinc</u>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zinc supplementation has some benefits against RNA viruses. Zinc is a trace element that is vital for the maintenance of immune cells for adaptive and innate immunity against any viral infection. It boosts the host defense mechanism. Furthermore, zinc supplementation can increase the ability of natural killer cell levels, which is important for defense mechanisms. Adequate intake of zinc has been associated with reduced occurrence of infections and antiviral immunity. It has a property to inhibit the replication of viruses and for the same reason, it might be considered effective against replication of covid-19 virus as well.<sup>4</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. <strong><u>Vitamin C</u>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are varieties of vitamins available in the market today, but vitamin C is proposed as an immunity booster against covid-19. In humans, it is identified that vitamin C improves the immune system by reducing oxidative stress in the lungs and whole body. It reduces the risk, severity, and duration of infectious diseases. Earlier evidence says that deficiency in water-soluble vitamin C can cause pneumonia. Whereas after administration of vitamin C in the infected patients, it has positive effects on the symptoms of respiratory tract infections. It prevents pneumonia and protects from other infections as well. In a new clinical trial, vitamin C is under investigation as severe cases of Covid -19 have shown to cause pneumonia. As there is the absence of specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2, vitamin C may show a ray of hope to cure this severe viral respiratory tract infection. Vitamin C increases the resistance against SARS-CoV-2 and shows improvement in lowering the spread of infection to lungs under certain conditions.<sup>1</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. <strong><u>Vitamin D</u>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vitamin D, the sunlight vitamin has become a leading preventive measure and therapeutic nutraceuticals against covid-19. Vitamin D for many years has been in use for bone development and density. The active ingredient in vitamin D is calcitriol that influences many effects on the immune system and inflammatory response. Studies have shown that vitamin D improves lung function in children suffering from bronchial problems and reduces the chances of infection in them.4 Vitamin D inactive form is gets induced in respiratory pathway protecting it.1 Vitamin D is an immunomodulator of antigen-presenting cells. Because of its potential modulating properties, vitamin D supplementation may be advantageous to maintain a healthy immune system. Although the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation against covid-19 remains open for debate.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>5. <strong><u>Selenium</u>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For increasing immunity against the covid-19 virus, it is important to showcase the benefits of selenium. The property of selenium is redox homeostasis and anti-oxidant properties against viral infections. Selenium deficiency in the body is known to cause impaired immunity against viral infections and flu. This deficiency turns out in the favour of viruses, which further increases their virulence and pathogenicity in the body. There is evidence suggesting that daily intake of supplementary selenium is beneficial in improving immunity against the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. <sup>3</sup></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6. <strong><u>Glutathione:</u></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glutathione is a master of antioxidants in all tissues. It plays many roles like detoxification, antiviral defense, and immune booster. Oxidative stress has been associated with many lung-affected diseases. An oxidative stress level plays a vital role in the immune response to viruses. Viral infections cause inflammation due to reduced oxidative levels. Anti-oxidant therapies with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have largely been used to treat bronchitis and glutathiones have been used locally in the treatment of lung diseases. Many studies suggest that glutathione can be restored oxidative levels and can be considered a treatment option for many respiratory infections. The oxidative stress in covid-19 is the currently prevailing hypothesis; hence this treatment approach can be considered. Considering, NAC is a substrate of glutathione a sufficient dose can be administered either for preventive or treatment action.</p>

<p><strong><u>Nutraceuticals for boosting immunity in pregnant women</u></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pregnancy is a sensitive time for women. Any infection or disease is a big risk for the mother and baby. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to catch infections and get a disease. It is vital that a mother strengthens her immunity in every way she can as the viral infections are able to reach the fetus by crossing the placenta having bad consequences on the baby. Maternal immunity plays a critical role in maintaining and completing a healthy pregnancy for this a well-balanced diet is a must. Certain nutraceuticals are also considered safe for consumption during pregnancy like calcium, iron, magnesium, iodine, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin D, folic acid, and ginger. <sup>5</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Nutraceuticals for boosting immunity in children</u></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The novel SARS CoV-2 is a virus for which no one has an in-built immunity. This fear has developed among parents. To boost your child’s immunity against Covid-19, it is important that to breastfeed the baby during its early days to strengthen its immunity. Lack of nutrition can alter the immune response of children; hence nutrition is an important factor to be considered. A few immunity-boosting vitamins and nutraceuticals are available that are safe to use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table -->
<figure class=""wp-block-table""><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Nutraceuticals</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Vitamin E</strong></td><td>Has antioxidants and may support immune function</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Vitamin A, D, B6, B12</strong></td><td>Boosts immune system</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Proteins</strong></td><td>Building blocks for child’s immune system, healing and recovery</td></tr><tr><td><strong>probiotics</strong></td><td>Friendly bacteria that keeps the gut healthy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zinc, selenium</strong></td><td>Regulates immune system to function properly</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a nutshell, many nutraceuticals are under evaluation for the treatment and prevention of Covid-19. Their positive results are attributed to their anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antioxidant, and immune-boosting properties. More clinical trials would help generate relevant efficacy and safety data that will support the claims of many nutraceuticals and help healthcare professionals in decision making. Clinical practitioners must be made aware of such alternative therapies for Covid-19.</p>

<p>Clinical studies cost money, time, and animal lives. There is an urgent need for alternative ways to model human diseases in-vitro to speed-up the new drug development process. Recently, Indian researchers have started exploring advanced technologies to replace animals in research. Organs on a chip (OOCs) is a novel concept, emerging as the next wave of 3D-culture models that function like a natural whole living organ. It would have the same biological activities, mechanical properties, and biochemical functions. The concept of “organ-on-a-chip”, also known as microfluidic&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;cell culture systems was first established in 2010. The OOC market&nbsp;size is expected to reach $170 million by 2023, registering a CAGR of 63.2% from 2017 to 2023. The heart-on-chip type has a higher potential for growth in the global market.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These microdevices can recapitulate the microscopic structure and functions of living human organs, including lung, intestine, kidney, skin, bone marrow, and blood-brain barrier, among others. OOCs are living, 3D cross-sections of major functional units of living organs. They are translucent and thus could provide an understanding of the inner functioning of human cells in living tissues. The recapitulations of cellular events in OOC devices provide them an edge over two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cultures and open a gateway for their newer applications in biomedicine.</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Top Impacting Factors</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The surge in applications of OOC devices in the pharmaceutical sector is multifactorial. Firstly, rising demand for OOCs i.e. in-vitro analysis of biochemical, and genetic &amp; metabolic activities of living cells in a functional tissue. Secondly, drug screening involves drug toxicity or drug effectiveness in various organs. Lastly, the rise in demand for lung- &amp; kidney-based organ culture devices involving laboratory-engineered and functional organs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The advantages of OOC in pharmaceutical drug discovery are attributed to low cost, drug target identification, toxicity and drug efficacy evaluation, drug screening, the response of a combination, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics invitro.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a better alternative to conventional cell culture and animal models, OOCs could really transform drug research and development. Broad applications of OOCs show promise but have certain limitations including their limited use in chronic diseases, adaptive immune response, metabolism, and complex systems such as endocrine, skeletal, and nervous system. Despite their limitations, OOCs have the potential to play a transformative role in the pharmaceutical industry and would streamline the preclinical process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a nutshell, it is concluded that Organ on a Chip (OOC) technology has exciting avenues to explore in drug discovery and development. These are the upcoming alternatives to traditional animal testing. More evidence is needed for OOCs, but progress will come from better investment and guidance from regulators. Therefore, it is essential to establish centers of excellence for developing such technologies that can replace animal testing and speed-up the drug development process.</p>

63828,ViewPoints Article: Over Prescribed Medications and its Impact,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Over-prescription” is defined as the action of prescribing a drug or treatment in greater amount or on more occasions than necessary. Overprescribing, in general in health care, has been a subject of frequent study. For instance,&nbsp;research&nbsp;published in 2018 found that 46% of a half-million outpatient antibiotic prescriptions were written by clinicians without diagnoses of infection.<sup>1</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A recent survey conducted in the USA shows an increasing amount of prescribed medication therapy. Overprescribing is a major issue in the medical world. Unfortunate statistics show that the number of patients receiving unnecessary prescriptions is rising. This growing problem leads to the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs. A doctor might prescribe a drug. But it can still have the same addictive and damaging qualities as an illegal high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Over-prescribed drugs &amp; factors</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different drugs such as opioids, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), antibiotics, antidepressants are generally overprescribed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""type"":""1""} -->
<ul type=""1""><li><strong>Opioids:</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opioids are generally used in the treatment of short-term pain which generally occurs after the surgery. They are generally safe for short-term use when used in an appropriate dose. However, tolerance develops rapidly to opioids within weeks of use. Therefore, to maintain the benefits of opioids, it is necessary to increase the doses of opioids. Furthermore, increasing the dose and duration of opioids elevate the risk of dependence and addiction.<sup>2,3</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The national survey conducted in 2015 shows that 38.7% of US adults use prescribed opioids in 2015 and an estimated 13.4 million of them misused or abused them.<sup>4</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The long-term prescription of opioids leads to adverse effects such as constipation (35%), sleep-disordered breathing (25%), sexual dysfunction (25 to 75%), sedation (15%).<sup>5</sup> &nbsp;Opioids to treat chronic pain represent the case of overprescribing of most concern.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>PPIs:</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PPIs suppress acidity in are generally prescribed in the treatment of ulcers, GERD, esophageal lining erosion, and some gastrointestinal disorders. PPIs are approved by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori ( 10 days), heartburn (2 weeks), GERD (8 weeks), and ulcers (2 to 6 months). <sup>7,8 </sup>However, a community survey indicated that 60% of the patients remained on PPIs for over one year period and 31% of them remained on PPIs for more than 3 years. 9 Long-term consumption of PPIs increases the risk of fractures, gastric polyps, low magnesium levels in the blood,&nbsp;<em>Clostridium difficile</em>&nbsp;infections, and anemia. Also, it is hard to discontinue maintained PPI use because 44-59% of patients experience symptomatic withdrawal (which occasionally can last for weeks) after the medication is discontinued.<sup>10,11</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PPIs are the most commonly prescribed drug by primary care physician and is found to be effective in the treatment of indigestion. The data suggest that over 60% of the patients consuming PPIs do not have labeled or licensed indication for taking PPIs or any [proved diagnosis.<sup>12</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antibiotic resistance is considered a challenge not only to the medical fraternity but also for researchers. It is generally accelerated by the overuse of antibiotics in general practice. Over-prescription of antibiotics is generally associated with increased risk of side effects, self-medication by the patient, and more frequent re-attendance. Antibiotic overprescription is a major issue in general practitioners and respiratory tract infection is the leading cause for their prescription.<sup>13</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Antidepressants:</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antidepressants particularly serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) provide additional benefits in patients with major depression disorder (MDD). However, the long-term use of antidepressants raises the risk of impaired sexual function, agitation diabetes, low bone density, and hypertension. Furthermore, at least 35% of persons who take antidepressants beyond 6 weeks experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the drug is abruptly stopped or its dose is reduced.<sup>14,15</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Polypharmacy</strong>:</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It means consuming five or more prescribed medications in the prior month which is more common in elderly patients. <sup>16</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Impact of Overprescription:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overprescription of medicine can affect different</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""type"":""1""} -->
<ul type=""1""><li><strong>Adverse consequences</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overuse of antidepressants, antibiotics etc. can lead to toxicity or unpleasant side effects on the patient. Antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are associated with a more than two-fold rise in the risk of falls in older adults (= 60 years) when over-prescribed. In comparison to the general population, the older age group possesses a high risk of injury, severe bleeding and significant neurological and musculoskeletal trauma, which is increased at an alarming rate.<sup>17</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over-prescription of antibiotics increases the risk of adverse events in patients. Antibiotics account for approximately 20% of all drug-related emergency department visits in the United States. Although nearly 80% of these visits are attributable to allergic reactions, certain commonly prescribed antibiotics contribute to conditions that range from gastrointestinal to neurologic and psychiatric disorders. The adverse effect occurred due to antibiotics are mild, but some are life-threatening such as hepatotoxicity due to amoxicillin and clavunate.<sup>18,19,20</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Overdose or over-use of drugs</strong>:</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the late 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry reassured that patients would not be addicted to prescription opioid pain relievers and therefore healthcare providers started prescribing them at a higher rate. It subsequently led to widespread diversion and misuse of these medications before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive.&nbsp;Opioid overdose rates began to increase. In 2017, more than 47,000 Americans died as a result of an opioid overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid.<sup>21,22,23</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Excessive prescription of antibiotics is also associated with overdose of antibiotics in adults as well as in children. Aggressive antibiotic use can wipe out many good bacteria from the intestine and leaves antibiotic immune bacteria behind to flourish in the intestine.<sup>24</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Increase in resistance to the therapeutic doses:</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over-prescription of antibiotics increases their consumption too often for the wrong reason and can change bacteria so much that antibiotics don’t work against them. The phenomenon is known as bacterial resistance or antibiotic resistance. Some bacteria are now resistant to even the most powerful antibiotics available. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem due to the over-prescription of antibiotics. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 25,000 people in Europe die each year as a direct result of resistant infection.<sup>25</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Increases healthcare cost &amp; hospitalization stay</strong>:</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the CDC, in the United States alone, antibiotic resistance could add&nbsp;about $1,400 to the hospital bill&nbsp;for treating patients with any bacterial infections. This additional cost could go up significantly to more than $2 billion every year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treating patients with resistant infections by using a combination of regimens may be ineffective; as a result, compared to other patients, they may need longer hospitalization stays as well as more intensive care units (ICUs) and isolation beds in order to prevent the spread of the infection.<sup>26</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the case of psychotropic drugs, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the total ""economic burden""&nbsp;of prescription opioid misuse alone in the United States is $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment, and criminal justice involvement.<sup>27</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Prescription drug abuse</strong>:</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prescription drug abuse is the use of prescription medication in a way that the prescribing doctor did not intend. Prescription drug abuse or problematic use can range from using a friend's prescription pain reliever for a backache to snorting or injecting ground-up pills to get high. Despite the negative consequences, drug abuse can become chronic and compulsive. Prescription drug abuse is a growing issue that can affect people of all ages, including teenagers. Opioid pain relievers, anti-anxiety medications, sedatives, and stimulants are the most commonly abused prescription drugs. Because commonly abused prescription drugs activate the brain's reward center, it's possible to develop physical dependence and addiction.<sup>28</sup></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overprescribing is a major problem in medicine. Regrettably, statistics show that the number of patients who receive unnecessary prescriptions is increasing. This growing issue leads to prescription drug misuse and abuse. A drug may be prescribed by a doctor. However, it can have the same addictive and damaging properties as an illegal high. Overprescribing can affect anyone, whether or not they have a medical condition. It makes drugs more readily available. It also encourages their illegal sale on the black market. Overprescribing is becoming more widely recognized as a risk. However, there is still a long way to go in terms of implementing administrative changes to make it more controlled.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current century has witnessed the universal spread of the unknown species of coronaviruses. The rapid deterioration of the public health system with changes in ecology and urbanization has accelerated more recurrent epidemics, which become more troublesome to prevent and contain promptly. A novel coronavirus (CoV) emerged in December 2019, is associated with respiratory system disease and reported to cause pneumonia which if worsen leads to death. The causative virus was later named severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) &amp; was recognized as the pathogen leading to COVID-19 disease. In the current situation, infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 are now rapid and aggressive and as of 10 May 2021 over 150 million cases were confirmed worldwide in more than 220 countries, with over 3,307,084 death.<sup>1</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The family of coronavirinae is a cluster of highly differentiated, enveloped, positive sense and single-stranded viruses [(+) ssRNA virus] which can induce respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological disorders with different severity in a wide range of animal species. CV can be categorized into a-, ß-, d- and ?-CoVs of which ß further subdivided into A, B, C &amp; D lineage. During the past 18 years, three neoteric ß-CoVs, SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), along with SARS- CoV-2 have emerged, engendering severe human diseases. The origin of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is not clear but recent studies identified that it might be transmitted through bat due to its high similarity with bats SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The mortality rate of SARS-CoV- 2 (~3.8%) is lower compared to that of MERS-CoV (37.1%) or SARS-CoV (10%), but the number of infections is more than ten times higher.<sup>2,3</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is closely resembling with other ß-CoVs with a genome size of close to 3kb which has has a nucleocapsid consisted of genomic RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein. The nucleocapsid is embedded in the phospholipid bilayer and is coated by two distinct types of spike proteins known as spike glycoprotein trimmer and hemagglutinin-esterase. Presence of Spike (S) protein helps in binding to receptors and is the key factor to determine the host tropism and transmission capacity. The matrix protein (M) &amp; viral envelop (E) also located in the viral envelop. The genomic analysis of the virus showed that it possesses 5’ &amp; 3’ terminal sequences with gene order 5’ – replicase open reading frame (ORF) 1ab-S-envelope(E)-membrane(M)-N’-3’. The virus is round or oval in shape with a diameter of 60-100 nm. The virus is most sensitive and can be inactivated by ultraviolet light or heating at 56 ºC for 30 minutes, using disinfectant (i.e. ether, 75% ethanol, chloroform).<sup>4</sup></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: The possible viral entry and replication mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.<sup>6</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share the same human cell receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for host cell entry. ACE2 is a type 1 membrane protein mostly expressed in the lungs, kidney, heart, and intestine. SARS-CoV-2 S protein exhibit a 10-20 fold higher binding affinity to ACE2. After entering the cell, SARS-CoV2 binds to ACE2 receptors through S protein and fuses with the cell membrane through the endosome pathway. Once entered into the body, the virus then releases RNA into the host cell and causes virus replication<sup>5</sup>(Figure 1)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As ACE2 is expressed highly in the nasal mucosa, bronchus, lung, heart, etc. most of the primary symptoms occur in these body parts (Figure 2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Stage I: Asymptomatic stage (initial 1-2 days infection)</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""align"":""left""} -->
<p class=""has-text-align-left"">The SARS-CoV-2 enters via the respiratory system and binds to the nasal epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. The main host receptor for viral entry into cells is the ACE-2, which is seen to be highly expressed in adult nasal epithelial cells. The virus undergoes local replication and propagation and the infection of ciliated cells in the conducting airways.26 This stage lasts a couple of days and the immune response generated during this phase is a limited one. In spite of having a low viral load at this time, the individuals are highly infectious, and the virus can be detected via nasal swab testing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Stage II: Invasion and infection if the upper respiratory tract</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this phase virus migrate from nasal epithelium to upper respiratory tract sue to which the disease manifests with symptoms of fever, malaise and dry cough. During this phase greater immune response occurs which involves the release of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL-10) and interferons (IFN-ß and IFN-?) from the virus-infected cells.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Stage III: Involvement of the lower respiratory tract and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patients in this phase develop severe symptoms as the virus invades and enters into type 2 alveolar cells epithelial cells via ACE2 receptor thereby undergoes replication. The pneumonocytes filled with the virus release more cytokines and inflammatory markers (interleukin, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma &amp; beta, CXCL-10). This cytokine storm attracts more cells such as neutrophils, CD4 T helper cells &amp; CD8 cytotoxic T cells which isolate in the lung. These cells are involved in the fight with a virus, but they also cause subsequent inflammation and lung injury. Due to continuing injury caused by inflammatory cells and viral replication leads to loss of type 1 &amp; type 2 pneumocytes, there is diffuse alveolar damage eventually culminating in an acute respiratory distress syndrome.<sup>7</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Diagnostic testing for COVID-19</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is very important to control outbreaks of viruses in the communities. Advance technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT- LAMP) are useful in the diagnosis of CoVs.<sup>6</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Therapeutics options available for SARS-CoV-2</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, substantial efforts are in progress to discover new therapeutic drugs for CoV infections. Till date a wide variety of therapeutic agents has been selected for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials (Table1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A. </strong><span><u style=""font-weight: bold;"">Antiviral agents</u><b>:</b></span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Nucleoside analogs: </strong></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These agents can affect nucleotide synthesis pathways and terminate virus replication thereby accumulating mutation and cutting off the entry of natural nucleoside. Ribavirin is an approved nucleoside guanine analog used in the treatment of hepatitis C virus and respiratory syncytial virus infections and has been utilized to cure SARS patients. When Ribavirin combined with IFN- beta it can exert a synergistic inhibition effect on SARS-associated CoV replication during in vitro study.8 However, safety and efficacy are uncertain as it may cause an adverse reactions at high doses like anemia. In COVID-19 treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another agent, favipiravir which is a guanine analog has been approved in Japan for suppression of infections caused by the influenza virus. Recent work suggests favipiravir may be a potential candidate for COVID-19 as it displayed effectively in vitro antiviral action in Vero E6 cells with an EC50 value of 61µm. Combination of favipiravir with other antiviral drugs such as baloxavir marboxil utilized to improve the condition of COVID-19 patients.<sup>9</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An adenine analog that is approved HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as remdesivir, tenofovir, alafenamide exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses and has the capacity to compete with RdRp thereby inhibit RNA replication. Study results showed that severe COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir showed good clinical improvement (68%).<sup>10</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. <strong>Type I interferons:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are antiviral cytokine that undermines viral replication in host cells. In China, therapy guidelines for COVID-19 recommend the management of 5 million U of IFN- avia vapor inhalation in patients twice daily with ribavirin as a combined therapy. The study by Sallard et al reported that IFN-?1 might constitute safe and easy to upscale treatment against COVID-19 during an early stage of infection.<sup>11, 12</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3<strong>. Protease inhibitors:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They can block viral replication by binding to enzymes responsible for proteolysis. Medicines approved for HIV treatment such as lopinavir and ritonavir found to possess antiviral action against SARS and MERS. A clinical study revealed that a combination of remdesivir with lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon ? against MERS-CoV but treatment with remdesivir found to be more effective in terms of reducing viral load and improving lung conditions. Lopinavir-ritonavir shows benefit in terms of efficacy such 16 days median time for clinical improvement inpatient and reduction in viral load in severe SARS-CoV-2 patient.&nbsp; Furthermore, a lower rate of death was observed in patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir in the late stage of the disease.<sup>13,14</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>B. </strong><span><u style=""font-weight: bold;"">Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine</u><b>:</b></span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anti-malarial drugs chloroquine found to be effective as broad-spectrum antiviral agents. It elevates the endosomal pH needed for virus-cell fusion and disrupts the glycosylation of virus receptors. Studies found that chloroquine therapy is effective in COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Another drug hydroxychloroquine which an analog of chloroquine found to possess anti-SARS CoV action in vitro study. In the pa pharmacokinetic model, it was found that hydroxychloroquine is more effective than chloroquine in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess immunomodulatory action and inhibit cytokine storms. <sup>15,16</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>C. <u>Monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies</u>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antibodies are recommended as a tool to prevent and treat viral infections. Anti-SARS CoV-specific human mAB CR3033 found to be effective due to its cross-reactivity with COVID-19 S protein. Another monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab found to be effective in suppressing the binding of IL-6 to its receptors and mitigate cytokine release syndrome. Another isolate 2 specific human mAbs named CA1 &amp; CB6 found to possess potent SARS-CoV2 specific neutralization activity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use of neutralizing antibodies become a promising strategy to reduce inflammatory response thus responding well to treat COVID-19.<sup>17,18,19</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>D. <u>Corticosteroids</u>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Corticosteroids lower inflammation and have been used in several respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but with limited benefits. In a study performed on 41 COVID-19 patients use of corticosteroid in 22% of the patient found to be reduced inflammation of the lung. However, as per WHO interim guideline do not recommend the use of glucocorticoids due to its possible injury and increased risk of death.<sup>20</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>E. <u>Convalescent plasma transfusion</u>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The convalescent plasma technique has been used as a last resort in order to improve the survival of COVID-19 patients. In this technique, plasma is collected from the person recovered from COVID-19 which may inhibit viremia.<sup>21</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>F. <u>Herbal medications</u>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During outbreaks in different countries, herbal drugs such as <em>Astragali Radix, Withania somnifera, Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Saposhnikoviae Radix, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos</em> and Fructus forsythia were commonly used for improving the condition of COVID-19. <sup>22</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>G. </strong><span><u style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mesenchymal stem cell therapy</u><b>:</b></span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some investigators demonstrated that intravenous administration of mesenchymal stem cells was safe and effective for COVID-19 pneumonia in critical patients. The use of mesenchymal stem cell therapy leads to immunomodulation and counteracts the cytokine storm aroused by the immune system and nurtures endogenous repair via reparative attributes of the stem cells.<sup>23</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>H. </strong><span><u style=""font-weight: bold;"">Other therapies</u><b>:</b></span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use of hydrogen peroxide found to be effective as it helps to prevent the virus from speeding inside the body. Study revealed that 0.5% of hydrogen peroxide could kill human CoVs such as those that caused by SARS and MERS. By inhaling vapors of hydrogen peroxide can easily penetrate nostrils, sinuses, and lungs which are commonly affected by a respiratory disease like COVID-19.&nbsp; As per the National Health commission of China, the conditional use of mixed inhalation of hydrogen and peroxide (H2/O2: 66.6%/33.3%) treatment may improve the symptoms.24&nbsp; In another therapy, lung transplantation can be performed in advanced patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 related pulmonary fibrosis.<sup>25</sup></p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5><strong>SARS-CoV-2 vaccines</strong>:<sup>26</sup></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For controlling the epidemic caused by emerging viruses, rapid diagnosis and efficient vaccine serve as a complementation to antiviral therapy. Different vaccines to date are under different phases of a clinical trial. The status of different vaccines developed during the crisis is summarized below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DNA vaccines offer precise and flexible tactics to deliver antigens to the body’s immune system and can hold extra sequences of coding molecules to influence the result. To date, different DNA vaccine platforms have been exploited to augment the vaccine effectiveness through electroporation to deliver plasmids and additional adjuvants thereby improve immune response. Inovio Pharmaceuticals initiated pre-clinical trials of DNA vaccine (INO-4800) against COVID-19. It induces T cell activation by transferring DNA plasmids that express SARS-CoV-2 S proteins.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A. <u>DNA based vaccine</u>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AnGes, Inc.s biopharmaceutical developed DNA based vaccine named AG0301 which encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that disables the connection between coronavirus protein spike and human cell receptors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>B. <u>mRNA based vaccine</u>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mRNA vaccine becomes an alternative to traditional vaccine methods which provides high efficiency, rapid development capabilities, and low-cost manufacturing. Moderna launched mRNA-1273 encodes the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Another vaccine named ARCoV based on mRNA was developed by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Academy of Military Sciences, Suzhou Abogen Biosciences, and Walvax Biotechnology Co., Ltd, was officially approved by the National Medical Products.</p>

<p>Recombinant subunit vaccines are found to be superior to other types of vaccines as they are safe and possess fewer adverse effects. Clover Biopharmaceuticals was pre-clinically testing a recombinant subunit vaccine in the light of the S-Trimer of the SARS-CoV-2. The researchers detected the antigen-specific neutralizing Abs in the sera of fully recovered patients. Besides, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) disclosed a vaccine that can elicit a protective immune response against SARS. The vaccine contains an S protein immunogen, which was combined with the emulsion adjuvant, GSK2, yielding an elevated level of anti-SARS- CoV IgG2a/IgG2b Ab responses. Recently, GSK and Clover Biopharmaceuticals announced a partnership to enhance immune response via introducing GSK’s adjuvant system to S-Trimer.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite global efforts made to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection, the current epidemic has expanded into a full-blown pandemic inducing panic and economic slowdown. Due to a large number of infections healthcare system in many areas are overburdened and under-resourced which pushes medical workers to make a formerly unthinkable judgment. In the wake of such a severe condition, different investigators have pursued approaches to tackle the direct impact of COVID-19 either by use of modeling study of the viral activity or via analyzing potential; therapeutic potential options and finding vaccines to end the pandemic.</p>

41401,ViewPoints Article: Revised approach for First Aid during and after the Catastrophic Pandemic â€“ Safe and Saving,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The SARS CoV-2 or COVID-19 pandemic has changed human life permanently. Hence, a few critical areas need revisiting in light of these changes to set a “new normal” for them. One of such areas is first aid. Correctly given first aid helps the victim of an emergency episode of a disease or an accident prevents damage and thereby disabilities and often saves a life. &nbsp;While the post-pandemic world changes social behaviour, diseases and emergencies continue to influence human life in the same way. In fact, with fewer visits to the hospital and significant healthcare resource consumed by the pandemic, the need for first aid is enhanced. However, the nature of infection of SARS CoV-2 requires to revisit the first aid practice to ensure the safety of both, the rescuer and the victim.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are multiple advisories and instructions issued by authorities on this matter, including National Safety Council of America, American Red Cross, St. John Ambulance, St. Andrew First aid, European Resuscitation Council, etc. On the other side, there is a debate about whether CPR is safe during the SARS CoV-2 global outbreak, also known as COVID 19 Pandemic. However, most of these literature focuses on Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and a few on psychological first aid, which may not be enough in the current situation of a highly spreading contagion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hence, this article discusses top 10 changes in the first aid practice in the local context.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Be more prepared</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep yourself informed and updated</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SARS CoV2 infection and multiple unidentified risks, which the authorities are publishing from time to time. A first aider must remain updated about risks, treatment, first aid approach, advisory and instructions by referring to websites and news feed. In addition to the national emergency helpline numbers, there may be some helplines for COVID-19. One important aspect that may go unnoticed changes in emergency contacts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1.2  Carry and use Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) where possible</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A First aider is at a high risk of exposure to coronavirus infection. Hence, it is important to use PPE. However, if PPE is not available, it is advised to use full sleeves apron or an additional over cloth (like a shirt or jacket over already worn clothes).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1.3&nbsp; Carry extra gloves, extra mask, fluid resistance Mask/towel</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A first aider willing to serve during the pandemic situation should try to carry multiple PPE. At least, should carry multiple gloves and masks, especially fluid resistant masks or clothes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1.4&nbsp;Use disinfectant spray, a spray of disinfectant mouthwash</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Disinfection is the key of prevention of coronavirus infection. Hence, even for personal hygiene use of sanitation production is strongly recommended. Hence, along with hand sanitizers, it is important for first aiders to carry and use spray sanitizers and the mouth sanitizers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes in First aid infrastructure and equipment availability</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the composition of the first aid box in vehicles etc.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A new first aid box must include some additional material beyond the routine equipment and materials. These new additions are – PPE Kit, Masks (minimum 2), Gloves (minimum 4 pairs), face shields, disinfectant spray, mouth disinfectant, sealable bag, fluid-resistant clothes and plastic sheets, women-sanitary pad or absorbent diapers and bag valve mask breather.&nbsp; In addition, it is advised to keep touchless thermometer and SPO<sub>2</sub> sensor in the First Aid box.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Oxygen cylinders to be made available at all establishments like ATM, Bank, community places</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like the fire extinguishers are placed in all notified places such as banks, vehicles running on gas, ATM rooms, community centres, offices, there must be a provision of placing oxygen cylinders with disposable masks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2.3&nbsp;AED or mechanical CPR equipment to be available in public places</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Cardiac Arrest AED is an important therapy. However, there is some level of risk attached to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3 Reframe risk assessment</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lay rescuer / trained non-medical first aiders are usually the first level persons to reach the casualty. Hence, the first aider must suspect every case as a SARS (Corona infections of all types) case unless confirmed otherwise. The first change is to start with an assessment of the level of COVID Risk of the area.&nbsp; Applications like google maps are useful often. Some countries practice placing signage to indicate risk zones. In addition, the pandemic calls for a multilevel additional assessment to check for COVID-19.&nbsp; Especially, the first aider must assess the risks of cross-contamination, like if there are somebody discharges around or on clothes of the casualty including spits, sputum, saliva, blood, vomitus etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to risks also need to check for resources like first aid box, resuscitation machines, oxygen cylinder etc. Their appropriate use will help maintain safety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4 Unlearn and Relearn First Aid skills</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First aiders are traditionally trained to assess surrounding, casualty etc. However, SARS COV2 is a contact-spread infection. Hence, the first-aiders need to avoid a few important first aid techniques consciously, that deemed the best suite before set up of the pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Staying Safe while giving first aid during the pandemic</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While we discussed multiple changes so far, there are several personal responses, which are important to remember and execute at all times. Few of them are a repetition of what is stated already</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Tell the crowd to maintain social distancing or to completely disperse. Use enough protection. If there is PPE kit, use, if not, use apron, overcoat or plastic sheet to cover the first aider </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Minimize provider exposure, Do not touch a wound or any of the body fluids, exposed dressings, pads, etc. Also, do not touch anything that is meant to touch patient’s sensitive areas esp. face, wounds, etc. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Sanitize hands and face of rescuer and first aider before checking for eyes, tongue, and breathing  Disinfect immediately before and after the procedure</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the casualty assessment and response</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Do not touch any part and surroundings of a casualty with bare hands. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Do not check to breathe by placing an ear near the nose to avoid close proximity. Instead, use trusted mobile apps to monitor vitals like SPO2, Blood pressure, Heart rate, and respiratory rate, except when cardiac arrest is suspected.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Use of Sylvester (Fig.1), Holgar - Nelson method (Fig.2), Schafer's method (Fig.3), where possible than using mouth to mouth or mouth to nose ventilation except for cardiac arrest. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><figcaption>Fig.3: Schafer's method (source: flickr.com)</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. In case of conditions like epileptic seizures, cover the patient's body first before holding the limbs or provide disposable soft support to avoid injury. In both these conditions, avoiding exposure to anybody's fluids is extremely important. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differences in methods of carrying</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually, when a first aider carries a casualty, in any position (fireman’s lift or back-mount) carrier’s face is exposed to risk. Hence, it is important to over the casualty correctly with a fluid resistant clothes or plastic sheets etc. and use face shield to minimize exposure. In two or more persons carry (stretcher, fore and aft etc.) the risk to carrier is relatively less. However, in this case, for security of the casualty from exposure to external droplets, it is important to cover the casualty properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. Safe Disposal of all exposed material</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Safe disposal of all exposed material is now a part of first aid. While earlier it was fair to dispose the bio-waste into safe trash, now the definition has included many critical aspects All exposed material and not just bio-waste, including PPE, Masks, kit materials like cotton, dressing, overclothing must be removed immediately after first aid, disinfected, and store in a sealed disposable bag before handing them over to biohazard disposal team. No material to be left unattended even after disinfection. The clothing must be laundered immediately if possible. The area of the casualty must be correctly disinfected after removal of the casualty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;Safe Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation&nbsp; (CPR)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands-only CPR continuous compressions at a rate of at least 100–120 min</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hands-only CPR is chest compression at a rate of 100 – 120 chest compressions per minute with inspection of the airway and as needed extension of the neck every minute. The C-A-B steps should be followed as otherwise, but Mouth to mouth ventilation to be avoided unless extremely necessary. Sylvester method may be used instead of mouth-to-mouth / nose ventilation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use water absorbent, fluid-resistant mask</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If mouth-to-mouth respiration is inevitable, water-absorbent, fluid-resistant mask or cloth in multiple folds for both rescuer as well as for the casualty must be used. The mouth and face of both the rescuer and the casualty must be sanitized with spray disinfectant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7. Safe Road management of accidents, injury, wound, and blood handling</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7.1&nbsp; Care of wounds and bleeding</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First aid for bleeding continues in the same hierarchy with elevation with direct pressure, pressure points and tunicates as first, second and third line of treatment. However, it is important to continue keeping complete aseptic precautions while handling the wound. No wound should be touched with open hands. There should not be any pre-exposed dressing for the wounds including open fractures. All rescuers must wear mask and gloves at all times and all other persons must stand at least 2 meters away from the casualty. The safe disposal and post-removal sanitation must be practised.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care for Close fractures</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no difference in handling the close fractures. However, the sanitation and safe disposal with social distancing must be practised.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7.3&nbsp; Other bleeding</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For visible / diagnosed internal bleeding ice-cold water bath or ice-pack must be applied in as condition. In case of vomiting of blood, the patient should be given ice-cold water to drink. In vaginal bleeding, the patient should be given a comfortable sitting position with a pad. However, the most important aspect is anything that is provided to the patient, must be sanitized at all levels and all the immediate handlers must sanitize their hands well. All the discharges must be well disinfected as soon as possible.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>8&nbsp; Safe first aid for respiratory conditions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":41407,""sizeSlug"":""large""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><figcaption>Fig 3: flickr.com</figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infectious and acute respiratory conditions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In case of acute respiratory conditions, risk if SARS COV-2 is the highest. Hence, the patient must be asked to wear a double mask, face shield and disinfect his clothes, hands and face. The rescuer must wear PPE before handling the patient. If there is breathlessness, the patient must be made to sit on a chair with the head rested on the back with extension. If an oxygen cylinder is available, the patient must be given oxygen to breathe. COVID 19 helpline must be immediately called for further help. The rescuer must follow the diagnosis of the patient. If the patient is tested positive or is a suspect of coronavirus infection, the rescuer must go for isolation and testing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acute Exacerbation of Asthma</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In case of acute exacerbation of asthma, the patient should be given moral support, with some instructions from the social distance, unless the patient looks to have an emergency need. In emergency need, the patient should be given bronchodilator and comfortable position with moral support. All the procedure must be with minimum PPE (Gloves, mast and face shield) and after handling the patient and his belonging, hands must be sanitized with change of gloves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe First Aid in shock, stroke, heart attack</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First aid approach for critical conditions like shock, stroke and Heart attack is changed to include disinfection and PPE use and social distancing before the start of the first aid. While all these three are an emergency situation, all three are extremely susceptible to infection of SARS CoV-2 Infection. Hence, the patient requires more than usual care to avoid cross-contamination. Hence, the first most important step (maybe even before the first aider prepares with PPE, the crowd must be pushed back more than 3 meters and with the help of a reliable assistant (family member, PPE / safety gear wearing security guard or a person from forces etc.) the area around must be disinfected).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>9.1 Changes in shock first aid approach</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. While giving the heal-low position to the patient, place a clean paper / plastic sheet under to avoid contamination from down. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. While loosening the clothes, start immediately after sanitizing hands. Follow sequence Face, Head, chest, waist, feet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. While providing a patient with a warm cover, use a fresh disposable sheet below the cover and disinfect the warm cover with a spray disinfectant </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. Rest head tilted on the side on an absorbent pad (sanitary pad in women hygiene or absorbent diaper is the best) </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the approach for stroke first aid</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. If there is any active bleeding, vomiting, plasma or nasal discharge, wipe it only with the absorbent pad or fresh absorbent cotton. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. If CPR is needed, use low pressure oxygen or bag valve mask breather instead of other artificial method. If heart function is normal and the patient can be laid down, use chest compressions for breathing. Avoid moving limbs, especially if they are week. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Do not give anything including blood pressure-lowering drugs orally. Rather reach the nearest medical centre</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in approach for heart attack first aid</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. The first aid for heart attack remains grossly the same, with a few precautions to avoid cross-infection. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. There is a high possibility that the low oxygen saturation mimics symptoms of a heart attack. Hence, it is important to have all safety precautions</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psychological first aid</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Psychological first aid is an emerging technique, which has immense importance in the current pandemic situation. There is an increasing number of psychological casualties due to fear, anxiety, or depression due to many reasons including loss of wedges, increasing incidence of stress-related complex, etc. &nbsp;There is a good informative article by&nbsp; George S. Everly, Jr. on this topic. That must be read and comprehended.&nbsp; A solution like a digital pet could be a good option.</p>

<p>Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are used efficiently by many researchers and companies to overcome challenges for improving medical diagnostics. <strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Insights on Diagnostic Errors</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diagnostic related errors contribute to a significant number of complications and patient deaths. According to the authors of an article published in BMJ, in the US, diagnostic error claims had a higher occurrence in outpatient (68.8%) vs. inpatient (31.2%) settings which could also be lethal [2]. Various factors contributing to diagnostic errors other than physician error are: &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Inefficiency in integrating and collaborating of Health Information Technologies (Health IT)</li><li>The communication gap between the clinicians, patients, and their Families.</li><li>Due to the designing of a healthcare work system that does not properly support the diagnostic process.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Current Applications of ML &amp; AI in Medical Diagnostics</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following are the categories for Machine Learning diagnostic applications:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Chatbots</strong>: NLP chatbots with speech recognition features helps in identifying patterns of the patient’s symptoms to have a preliminary diagnosis, prevent disease, and/or recommend an appropriate plan of action.</li><li><strong>Oncology</strong>:&nbsp;Techniques like Deep Learning image classification and Computer Vision are used by researchers to train the complex algorithms that help in recognizing cancerous tissue, and tissue biomarker analysis which can be comparable to trained physicians.</li><li><strong>Rare Diseases</strong>: Combination of machine learning and facial recognition software which will help clinicians diagnose rare diseases. Face analysis and deep learning detect phenotypes that correlate with rare genetic diseases.</li></ul>

<h5>Deep Learning and Medical Diagnosis</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deep Learning is a multilayer perceptron, where the training model learns in multiple layers. Majorly the deep learning techniques include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The image-based problems are majorly solved using Convolutional Neural Network because it has an additional feature engineering layer with Artificial Neural Network. An image has a huge amount of data as it is a matrix of pixels. The feature engineering reduces the size of the data (dimensions) and considers the data which makes a relevant impact on the outcome. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Out of various data science techniques, deep learning plays a major role in Whole Slide Imaging, and image-based classifications to make stronger evidence against the prediction of disease.  This includes but is not limited to health informatics, biomedicine, and magnetic resonance image MRI analysis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two approaches are used to apply deep learning for medical diagnosis:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first approach is a classification that includes the reduction of possible outcomes (diagnosis) by mapping data to specific outcomes. The second approach is used to identify and diagnose malignant tumors, or other diseases by collecting physiological data which includes medical images and data from other sources. The Deep Learning model can also be used for dietary assessment support by using the ANN algorithm. These approaches may increase the quality and efficiency of healthcare in the future and will reduce the risk and complication of serious diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Diverse application of deep learning in the field of medical diagnosis</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;Deep Learning methods are widely applied in the medical field. This includes detection, classification, prediction, and others as mentioned earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deep learning can support doctors in the medical field</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI will help future medical science due to the increased volume of medical data, more powerful computers, and smarter algorithms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Applications of Deep Learning in Medical Diagnosis</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Breast cancer screening</li><li>Early melanoma detection</li><li>Lung cancer screening</li><li>Diabetic retinopathy screening</li><li>Cardiac risk assessment from electrocardiograms (ECGs)</li><li>CT Scans of the head help early diagnosis of stroke.<strong></strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Other Technological Applications in Diagnosis</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Machine Learning For Better Patient Record Analysis</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Complex patient information systems are developed in hospitals that will allow the exchange of patient data between divisions and hospitals easily. ML-based systems will help to spot negative traits that may denote injury by studying patient data. Having access to a patient`s electronic medical data helps the healthcare professional in diagnosis and unnecessary tests could be avoided.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ophthalmology</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; To diagnose eye disease in clinical practice, it is required to interpret the imaging studies for auxiliary diagnosis. However, detecting the resolution of the human eye is limited. Proficiency levels of ophthalmologists also differ and it's inevitable for human errors to occur. Hence, there is a need to have a model to detect and distinguish different retinal disorders simultaneously. The solution to this is machine learning</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;Electronic medical records (EMR)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Electronic Medical records (EMRs) help in diagnosis as they consist of clinical diagnostic and treatment information that can be extracted. Image analysis and EMR are combined by AI who rely on deep learning that will advance the diagnostic power and ability to monitor disease progression and response to treatment in a new way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How can doctors use technology to help them&nbsp;diagnose?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI is supposedly faster and could be better than a human brain. A very good example is how AI succeeded in saving the life of a patient when a team of skilled doctors failed which was reported as Japan’s first case where AI saved a life. A woman with a rare type of leukemia was correctly diagnosed by the&nbsp;AI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Applications include:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Data-driven medicine</li><li>Human genome project</li><li>Personalized medicine</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Five barriers to ML adoption in healthcare include regulatory issues, shortage of data on new diseases, data silos and privacy rules, lack of standardization, lack of trust, and aspect of a black box. The&nbsp;risks&nbsp;of AI are mainly programming errors, cyber-attacks, and accepting instruction in the literal meaning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>DeepGenix, </strong>a user-centric App focuses on providing information regarding an ailment and helps the users get educated by doing a preliminary diagnosis of their symptoms. It understands what a user is going through by a set of questions related to the symptom and predicts an ailment after a thorough analysis. This does not become an alternative to medical expertise. Being an education tool, DeepGenix educates the user about various ailments. The company also uses Computer Vision, and Deep Learning combined technology to analyze the skin image to diagnose skin diseases. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Digital Technology in Diagnosing COVID-19</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Containment of the pandemic relies significantly on early and accurate diagnosis</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Rapid identification of patients with COVID-19.</li><li>Improving diagnostic accuracy and speed</li><li>Reduce occupational exposure to the virus.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI and data-driven medicine have great potential to improve standards of patient care, save lives and money for health providers, particularly hospitals and research institutions. The future will witness more development in technology that will improve medical practice, diagnosis, and recovery. Novel and current technologies can be also used in general practice to know a patient’s current health status and rate of recovery. Finally, skill development and enhancement will have significant importance.</p>

40716,ViewPoints Article: The New Normal and Covid-19 Vaccine Development,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the virus outbreak in China, all eyes are on the most awaited Covid-19 vaccine offering a glimmer of hope. Abide by social distancing, wearing a mask, and frequent hand washing - until we have a vaccine. This new mantra amidst all misery has created hope in the hearts of many. We have to accept the “new normal” until we have a vaccine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is a Vaccine?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vaccines, in a way, activate the immune system without the disease. Getting a particular vaccine is somewhat like having survived the disease once, without the health burden. Vaccines can be made with weakened viruses, inactivated viruses, and protein from a virus or even just the biological material (mRNA).</p>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How Do Vaccines Provide Immunity?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Immunity is the body's defense mechanism is to resist the effects of a microorganism. Immunity induced by a vaccine is weaker than that induced naturally after an infection. After you get a vaccine shot, your body will develop long-lasting antibodies that circulate in the blood. Such virus-specific antibodies will help to prevent severe disease. The vaccine will not prevent the entry of the virus into the body (infection), but it will prevent severe infection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Vaccine Development</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scientists have gone from the discovery of the virus to more than 165 candidate vaccines in record time, with 27 vaccines already in clinical trials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Challenges in Vaccine Development</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Laboratory development &amp; Preclinical testing</li><li>Large Clinical Trials</li><li>New technology for production</li><li>Availability: manufacturing millions of doses especially of a novel coronavirus</li><li>Developing an integrated and fair plan for vaccine distribution</li><li>Order of priority – health workers, elderly, and those with underlying conditions</li><li>Logistic –storage temperature</li><li>Resistance from the public – lack of awareness</li><li>Supply to rural areas</li><li>Multiple-dose may be needed</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When Can We Expect A Vaccine And How Has Development Been Stepped Up?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vaccine development normally takes years to complete, but the continuing crisis has prompted the multilateral system to accelerate the process. Regulatory approvals are up to speed but no important stages are skipped. This means that different tests of the vaccine are conducted in “parallel”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pandemic situation requires multiple activities and tests to be conducted at financial risk to stakeholders without knowing whether the vaccine candidate will be safe and effective.</p>

<p><strong>Research in India</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indian government agency is working at lightning speed to test and approve an Indian origin COVID-19 vaccine. The government has permitted six Indian companies to develop vaccines against COVID-19. Recently, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila were granted permission to start Phase I and II human clinical trials of their most advanced vaccines, named COVAXIN and ZyCoV-D respectively.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>India Will Be The Mass Manufacturer of The Covid-19 Vaccine</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>India is known for its mass manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Leading international bodies like the World Health Organisation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to obtain their vaccines from India. Now is the time when India can definitely leverage its ability to mass-produce a Covid-19 vaccine whenever it is ready and also help reduce the price of these vaccines. Reasonable price provided by India`s mass production ability would be the only factor in assuring the Covid-19 vaccine’s access across the globe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serum Institute of India (SII) located in Pune has entered a manufacturing partnership with British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to produce and supply 1 billion doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. These vaccines will be for India and middle- and low-income countries across the world (GAVI countries).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What Happens If You Choose Not To Get A Vaccine?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, you will not be protected from the deadly respiratory disease and may end up suffering from a severe infection. Secondly, refusal by many people might not get the country to herd immunity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What Lies In The Future?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even when a vaccine is introduced, we will have several months of significant infection or at least a risk of infection to take care of. This means that we may have to face more months under the threat of the novel coronavirus than we have already survived. If precautions are not taken and guidelines are not followed, there will continue to be more outbreaks, more deaths. The availability of the vaccine will be the slow start of the flattening of the curve. The total time taken to completely flatten the curve cannot be predicted, as it depends on awareness, accessibility, affordability, and adoption. With the world joining hands to find a vaccine for Covid-19, all eyes are on India, the powerhouse of vaccine manufacturing.&nbsp;It is a race between humans and the virus, rather than between countries or pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Putting an end to this viral disaster with a vaccine has led to a global vaccine race to coherently extinguish Covid-19. Each week brings news on early success, low cost, fast track results, promising effects because of vaccine optimism. There is too much uncertainty that continues to be pondered upon. The vaccine won't extinguish the disease itself but offer protection and immunity. It certainly will not immediately return life to “old normal”. The virus is too widespread but the vaccine could make Covid-19 easier to live with and prevent severe cases.</p>

35919,ViewPoints Article: Virtual Clinical Trials - Are They the Future of India?,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2020 is a year that nobody ever thought could turn their lives upside down. The beginning of this year witnessed the worldwide onset of Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 that has till now infected millions of people around the globe killing tens of thousands. In March 2020, WHO declared it to be a pandemic. There has been a global lockdown where people have been asked to stay at home and practice social distancing to “break the chain” of the spread of this deadly virus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Owing to this current scenario, several organizations have resorted to the “work-from-home” concept to keep the wheel of the economy rolling. But there are certain jobs that cannot be done while sitting at home. All healthcare professionals primarily come under this category.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The domain of Clinical Trials and Research has also been majorly affected by this pandemic. Usually, the human subjects undergoing trials of an investigational product are closely monitored. They need to be in close contact with the Research Associates, give their consents for participation, visit the trial sites, have to undergo regular diagnostic tests, get their vitals monitored, and so on and so forth. Similarly, routine site monitoring visits have also been restricted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So the question arises on how to keep the process of Clinical Trials going while simultaneously following the health guidelines during this time of crisis. That is where the concept of Virtual Clinical Trials (VCTs) comes into play. Virtual Clinical Trials also called remote or decentralized trials, are a relatively new and yet underutilized method of conducting clinical research taking full advantage of technologies such as apps, electronic monitoring devices, and online social engagement platforms. It has the potential to produce a momentous change in the way we conduct clinical researches by utilizing digital technologies to the best of their abilities for the benefit of both the patients and the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any clinical trial needs to recruit patients which is a time-consuming process when done traditionally, often resulting in delays. VCTs may overcome the challenges faced in conventional clinical trials while reaching a lot of people at a time through web-based platforms such as search engines and social media hereby saving a lot of money, time, and effort. This will, in turn, result in faster initiation of the study owing to the fast recruitment of subjects as the geographical limitation is obliterated. This will also facilitate a more diverse pool of patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Decentralized Clinical Trials, Pre-screening is conducted by circulating an e-questionnaire which can be filled by the potential subjects even from the comfort of their homes. E-consenting is the new future of Clinical Trials irrespective of the current COVID-19 crisis. It saves a lot of time at both ends and makes the process a lot faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remote visits, In-home nurse visits, Microsampling, mobile phlebotomists are all to play a big role in this new era of virtual clinical trials where physical examination, Laboratory testing, Medical imaging can all be done without much fuss that is caused by conventional clinical trials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking advantage of the upbeat technologies and hi-tech gadgets available nowadays, data collection can be done by the means of mobile devices like smartphones, smartwatches, e-diaries, interactive response technologies, etc. Medicines can directly be shipped to patients with proper guidelines for dosing advised to them through digital platforms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the study process is made easily accessible and simplified, patient compliance is increased. This, in addition, is likely to lower the dropout rates of the study subjects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A limited number of study sites are involved in Decentralized Clinical Trials morphing the concept of one site per country a reality. In globally conducted studies, the goal is to have only a single site in each country led by a principal investigator. &nbsp;A sub-investigator team is assigned to remotely monitor the health and safety of the participants where patients submit the data regarding the progress of the trial virtually via their mobile devices. A limited number of sites will also culminate in less expense on the sponsor’s end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there are surely some limitations to this emerging concept of Virtual Clinical Trials despite having endless benefits. The challenges that can be encountered while conducting VCTs must be taken into consideration. Whatever challenges the world may throw at us — now, and tomorrow, decentralized clinical trials which provide both virtual and hybrid options, represent an opportunity to rethink and refresh how&nbsp;research studies are conducted while keeping the patient at the heart of this&nbsp;emerging paradigm. Strategies like home nursing visits and remote patient engagement strategies should be incorporated into trials (e.g., patient recruitment and retention platforms, e-visits/video dosing regimens, and patient insight projects).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remote Clinical Trials being a relatively new concept, the regulatory approval framework is still in its early stage. <sup>&nbsp;</sup>The data safety aspect also needs addressing as the sharing of sensitive personal health data over the internet can prove to be a challenge. But securing the data with proper steps like encryption and password protecting the same can solve these issues. Strengthening the e-infrastructure is the first and foremost requirement for securing this highly sensitive information. The staff who will be monitoring the trials also need to be highly efficient and for that proper training is required.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also to be taken into account that some areas of clinical research are not yet ready for virtual remote monitoring like Phase-I of trials where patients need to be close to the site in case there is a reaction to the investigational product. Some diseases which require in-hospital monitoring are also less suited for VCTs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is why the concept of Hybrid Trial Design is evolving where we can get the bests of both worlds viz. Traditional and Virtual Clinical Trial Designs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the threat of COVID-19 looming over our lives, the clinical researchers are fast resorting to this new concept of VCTs where the health guidelines of maintaining social distancing can be achieved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking far into the future, in this new horizon of the digital era, where the traditional old concepts are getting replaced by newer and better ideas, VCTs can prove to be an indispensable method in the field of Clinical Trials though in India it can prove to be a little bit more difficult owing to the lack of awareness and proper knowledge about clinical trials. But, armed with strong resolutions and improved infrastructure we can hope for a brighter future for Virtual Clinical Trials in India.</p>

<p>Wearables are electronic devices consisting of sensors that can receive data of user’s personal health and exercise schedules. They work wirelessly or with the help of other devices such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The market of wearable technology was valued at $15.74 billion in 2015 &amp; expected to extend $51.60 billion by 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 15.51% between 2016 &amp; 2022.<sup>1</sup> The factor which contributes to the growth of the wearable market includes consumer inclination for gadgets, growth prospects of next-generation displays and escalating recognition of internet of things &amp; connected devices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The need of wearable technology:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wearables help to influence different fields such as health, fitness, disability, education, music, gaming, etc. The goal of wearable technology is to smoothly enter into daily activities and become a part of them. The hands-free nature of these computing devices makes them useful in businesses as well as individual use &amp; helps in tracking emergencies which makes the workplace more efficient and safer. Wearables are connected to smart devices and transmit information to them which can be viewed later to set the goal or track progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Types of Wearable Devices Currently Available in The Market</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":55958,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wearables-3.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-55958""/><figcaption><strong>Source: Medical Design and Outsourcing</strong></figcaption></figure></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The progress in wearable technology and growing consumer demand to control own health influenced the healthcare &amp; technology industry to build more wearable gadgets such as smartwatches, Fitbits, and wearable monitors. Currently following wearable devices are available in the market:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""type"":""1""} -->
<ol type=""1""><li><strong>Fitness Trackers: </strong>These are the simplest &amp; original forms of wearable technology in which wristbands are outfitted with sensors to monitor the user’s physical activity along with heart rate. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Smart Health watches:</strong> In the initial days, smartwatches only used to count daily steps &amp; showtime but over the period they renovated into clinically viable healthcare instruments. Smartwatches encourage an active lifestyle thereby offering personalized health care data, tracking of diet, calorie intake &amp; activity, helps in picking up a fitness routine,s and allow to set remainders for meditation, water consumption &amp; intermediate activity.</li><li><strong>Wearable ECG monitors:&nbsp;</strong> Most of the wearables in the market have optical heart rate monitors inside which use flashing LED to penetrate the skin and detect the blood flow. The reflected light by the blood flow is captured by sensors and the algorithm produces data about heart rate. The method is useful but not accurate for the detection of atrial fibrillation. To accurately measure atrial fibrillation, a wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) telemonitoring system based on smartphone &amp; cloud computing is used. A wearable ECG patch developed which collects ECG signals and sends them to the Bluetooth enabled smartphone. An android application displays the ECG waveform in real-time &amp; transmits every 30s ECG data to the cloud server.2 Apple watch is one of the first wearable devices which enable the wearer to get ECG from their wrist. Some other companies such as Fitbit, Samsung, Amazfit also developed smartwatch which can record ECG data in real-time.</li><li><strong>Wearable blood pressure monitors:</strong> These devices measure blood pressure levels accurately and are valuable for the management of hypertension using digital technology. Wearable BP monitors continuously monitor blood pressure during different activities including exercise &amp; during sleep. Technology does not involve uncomfortable inflatable cuffs or invasive measurements, but it uses continuous wave radar and photoplethysmogram sensors for blood pressure monitor. This device is useful in both health-conscious as well as hypertensive population.<sup>3</sup>Bibeat, Israel based medical technology company, received FDA’s approval for wearable parch &amp; smartwatches which can measure blood pressure.<sup>4</sup></li><li><strong>Biosensors:</strong> Wearable biosensors have the potential to generate continuous and real-time physiological information by non-invasive measurement of potential biomarkers in biofluids such as tears, sweat, saliva, and intestinal fluid. Using biosensors technology different wearables are developed such as smart socks for children to measure infants health using a mobile application, smart clothing for premature babies to prevent excessive sweating, helmets for treatment of depression, smart shoes for correcting motion abnormalities, digital clothing for the examination of metal conditions &amp; t-shirts for measuring stress were developed.<sup>5</sup></li><li><strong>Bioscarf: </strong>To prevent the allergy or to protect from cold and flu, bioscarf have been developed which are fitted with compatible air filters which keep out 99.75% of particulate &amp; air impurity. It helps to protect against pneumonia, influenza, tuberculosis, strep, and smoke.6</li><li><strong>Smart Sleep Deep sleep headband: </strong>Phillips has developed a wearable sleep headband along with a mobile application to improve the quality of sleep. During sleep when the body enters Non-REM deep sleep, heartbeat and breathing slow down to the lowest level, and muscles relax. This stage of sleep is known as “slow-wave sleep”.&nbsp; The sensors of the headband detect slow-wave sleep patterns and the algorithm triggers quiet audio tones to boost these slow waves thereby improving the sleep quality of the wearer. The SleepMapper app calculates sleep matrices and sleeps boost score on daily basis. The company claims that 80% of the users show positive results in the first two weeks of use.7</li><li><strong>Smart posture trainer: </strong>The slouching &amp; sitting often referred by healthcare professional as host for negative health effect which could turn into a bigger health issue. The correct posture will help us to prevent random body issues. Currently, various wearables are available in the market to correct the posture. They are attached to the back and alerts whenever you begin to slump with the help of soft vibrations which makes us aware of the right posture. NadiX, LumoLift, UprightGo are smart posture trainer currently available in the market.8</li><li><strong>Wearable smart rings:</strong> Some people don’t like to wear smartwatches or bracelets on their wrist all day &amp; night. Smart rings are more comfortable &amp; useful than smartwatches or bracelets as they are less obstructive. They contain components like sensors and NFC chips which are used to track daily activities and support tool to smartphones. Smart rings are useful not only in sleep &amp; fitness tracking but also in contactless payment, online security, smart key for the doo, and at times as remote control. They have long battery life as compared to smartwatches and bracelets.<sup>9</sup></li><li><strong>Other devices: </strong>Different wearables such as smart glass, smart hearing aids, wireless patient monitoring, smart clothing, smart jewelry have been developed and are useful in making human life much easier than before.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong>:<br>Wearable contribute majorly to healthcare system by means of disease prevention, detection &amp; taking precautionary measures. As technology advances, wearable becomes more sophisticated &amp; tinier along with enhanced data security and privacy. By the arrival of Internet of Things (IoT), wearables will gradually reduce human interference and automate several healthcare procedures.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What motivated you to introduce the digital health tool in this space?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> <em>Abbott knows that clinicians are constantly in search of more intuitive tools and easy-to-use applications that enable them to provide better care for patients living with chronic pain – particularly when trialing a new treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a spotlight on the need for digital and remote health tools – now, more than ever. At Abbott, we’re committed to helping people live the best life they can through good health. With Abbott’s NeuroSphere myPath, patients will have the ability to do that by recording their pain relief during the device trial period and easily connecting with their physician.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you give a glance at the working of the app?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> <em>First, the NeuroSphere myPath app receives the patient’s baseline pain and allows the patient to set their own customized goals – such as standing longer, walking farther, and sleeping better. Then, the app will produce a summary report based on the patient’s input, which is then reviewed by physicians who can make treatment recommendations and advise a patient on a more permanent implant. This should improve both the patient and physician’s insight into the patient’s response to the therapy and improve communication between them. For physicians, it is an opportunity to understand the patient’s journey better, while improving workflow efficiency within a busy practice environment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Briefly talk about the Proclaim XR and Proclaim DRG devices.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the role of Neurostimulators in the management of Chronic pain?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> <em>Neurostimulators deliver low-intensity electrical impulses to nerve structures to disrupt pain signals.<a href=""#_ftn1""><strong>[1]</strong></a> With this technology, neurostimulators allow </em>people living with chronic pain to <em>participate in everyday activities while bettering their quality of life.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the multiple educational programs Abbott is working on to improve the QoL of patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> <em>With Abbott’s NeuroSphere MyPath app, not only will patients have the ability to access specific educational resources, but they will be able to use their device to connect with Abbott support and learn how to track and report pain through this hands-on approach.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is there something you want to tell our readers about your upcoming projects?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Allen:</strong> <em>In the future, we envision that this app will continuously be enhanced to support patients through the entire SCS or DRG treatment process. Patient outcome tracking, including changes in pain relief, emotional well-being, and activity levels will provide physicians with an ongoing comprehensive report on how patients are responding to the therapy. Additionally, we’ve seen how the current digital healthcare landscape has revolutionized our ability to provide direct care for patients whenever they need it, so we’re working to expand our digital health platform to other areas in the near future.</em></p>

<p><strong>Neil:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>This CE Mark broadens access to TriClip G4 to more people with tricuspid regurgitation across the world. TriClip G4 provides a non-surgical therapy for addressing tricuspid regurgitation, a condition that has had historically limited treatment options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Tricuspid regurgitation typically impacts older individuals who have multiple co-morbidities, making open-heart surgery a high-risk procedure and resulting in many people going untreated. When individuals don't address their tricuspid regurgitation, they often develop other serious conditions such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure that may ultimately become fatal. Patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation typically have very unpleasant and debilitating symptoms that often do not respond well to medical therapy. With the minimally invasive TriClip G4 therapy, doctors can repair a patient’s tricuspid valve quickly and dependably, so that patients can get back to living a healthier and better quality of life without undergoing surgery</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation? What are its symptoms, diagnosis, and epidemiology?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Tricuspid regurgitation is a condition in which the valve between the two right heart chambers doesn’t close properly, resulting in a backflow of blood into the right atrium of the heart. Since there aren't often warning signs of tricuspid regurgitation like fatigue, shortness of breath, and abnormal heart rhythms until the condition is severe, it's often underdiagnosed or diagnosed incidentally when tests are conducted for other conditions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the clinical data supporting the CE mark of TriClip G4.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil:</strong>&nbsp; <em>Recent data from Abbott's TRILUMINATE CE Mark study for TriClip showed sustained improvement of symptoms, reduced severity of tricuspid regurgitation and improvement in functional status. These results demonstrate the benefits of the therapy and show that it is a safe and durable treatment option for high-risk patients with symptomatic moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we have a glance at the working and the design of TriClip G4? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil:</strong>&nbsp; <em>The TriClip G4 therapy is delivered to the heart through the femoral vein in the leg and works by clipping together a portion of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve to reduce the backflow of blood.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>TriClip G4 leverages the technology and robust body of evidence from our leading MitraClip device, which is a minimally invasive option to repair leaky mitral valves (mitral regurgitation). However, TriClip is specifically designed for the tricuspid valve’s complex anatomy and has a specialized delivery system engineered for navigating the right side of the heart.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>With the therapy, there is now, for the first time, a reliable treatment option for incredibly ill patients who are very often too sick or frail to undergo traditional surgery to fix their TR.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How this newest generation device better than the previous generation of the device?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil:</strong>&nbsp; <em>We, at Abbott, are always committed to continuously innovating our portfolio of transcatheter valve therapies to address debilitating heart conditions. The next-generation TriClip device has an enhanced leaflet grasping feature that helps physicians to deliver the device more effectively to the heart, and additional clip sizes that make treatment more customizable to different or more challenging patient anatomies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How TriClip TTVr is an innovative treatment alternative for patients who are at high risk of surgery?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil:</strong>&nbsp; <em>Traditionally, the only treatment options for tricuspid regurgitation have been surgery, which is rarely performed due to the complexity of the procedure and the high risks involved. Medical therapy primarily addresses symptoms but does not offer a long-term solution or address the underlying cause of the disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Since TriClip's initial CE Mark last year, the device has offered a safe, minimally invasive option for treating tricuspid regurgitation in patients who are not responding to medical therapy or who are not candidates for surgery. The TriClip procedure improves the quality of life for people with this condition, without the potential complications associated with open-heart surgery.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How this acquisition improves access, R&amp;D capabilities for Aceto?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mr. Cottier:</strong> <em>Aceto began building R&amp;D capabilities with its acquisition of Syntor in April 2020.&nbsp; The acquisition of Islechem doubles the R&amp;D staff in total at Aceto and builds critical mass across two continents to more rapidly respond to customer challenges and requests The two R&amp;D organizations are integrated and are immediately delivering value.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><strong>Tuba: Is Aceto planning for more such acquisition in same lines? Can we discuss more on the future acquisition and other investments Aceto is planning?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mr. Cottier:</strong> <em>Aceto has a long-term growth strategy to build upon our strong distribution platform, largely with manufacturing assets to deliver even more value to the markets we serve.&nbsp;As the company continues its track record of growth both organically and through acquisition, we will be working to diversify with attractive acquisition candidates that will allow us to enhance and grow our ability to be customer-centric, strengthen our management teams, bring unique capabilities to enhance our customer value proposition, expand Aceto's geographic presence and enhance core capability in manufacturing and expand our Life Science Markets presence.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What all other specialty chemicals and other products are expected to be part of the Aceto’s portfolio post this deal?</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mr. Cottier:</strong> <em>Islechem manufactures a set of Phosphate Esters utilized primarily in coatings.&nbsp; Islechem is recognized for its high quality, consistency, and service with this portfolio.&nbsp; However, Islechem’s more significant strength is its ability to solve specific customer chemistry challenges, be it the scale-up of an intermediate or the development of a custom chemical.&nbsp; Islehem has and leverages the following key strengths to deliver value:&nbsp;Fluorination, Reactive metals, Halogenation, Hydrogenations, Cyanation, Polymerizations, Organometallics, Quantum Dots, Hydrogenations, Esterifications, Silylation, Condensations</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does Aceto plan to expand access to India and China?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mr. Cottier:</strong> <em>While the IsleChem acquisition has allowed us to expand&nbsp;manufacturing expertise in the U.S., Aceto currently has diversified access to a robust global supply chain network. This deal complements strategic relationships with other global manufacturers, particularly in India and China.&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Today, the company’s operations span nine countries including the US, China, India, France, Germany, Netherlands, and the </em>Philippines. Our global network is staffed with teams that have extensive sourcing, warehousing, logistics, quality, regulatory, and compliance experience. This expertise allows us to provide clients the customer service, sales/marketing and overall administration support they need to develop and commercialize products.&nbsp;We have in-country expertise in both China and India, which is unique in the industry and enables enhanced communications, security,<em> and integrity of our worldwide sourcing and regulatory capabilities.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What does the acquisition of A&amp;C mean to Aceto?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mr. Cottier:</strong> &nbsp;<em>The acquisition of A&amp;C helps to drive Aceto’s growth strategy forward. We have a focused and intentional strategy in place to grow R&amp;D, manufacturing capabilities, and our Biopharma and SpecChem product portfolio. The acquisition of A&amp;C increases our GMP manufacturing, packaging, and ingredients offerings for the cell culture, vaccine, and biopharmaceutical industries, while also expanding our North American footprint.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does the acquisition help the company to grow its business and expand its footprints?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mr. Cottier:</strong> &nbsp;<em>A&amp;C hasmanufacturing facilities and offices in the USA, Canada and Ireland. The US and Canadian offices gives US-based companies a North American option when sourcing materials for their product development. Having a U.S. footprint allows us to increase the global reach of our already robust supply chain and access to our diverse Biopharma, API and SpecChem product portfolio.&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>COVID, natural disasters, and the recent canal&nbsp;blockage&nbsp;have shined a light on just how globally connected our world is. A ripple in the supply chain is far-reaching and impacts product supply, development, and availability. Because Aceto has a strong global technical network with feet on the street around the world and strategic relationships with manufacturers in the United States and internationally Aceto has been able to ensure global supply chain security and manufacturing. Expanding our US footprint and enhancing our product offering in North America&nbsp;ensures we can serve our customers' needs, where ever they are in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Highlight all the previous acquisitions that altogether allow you to bring new products globally.</strong></p>

56650,PharmaShots Interview: Adagio Therapeutics' Tillman Gerngross Shares Insight on the Development of Antibodies to Prevent COVID-19,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with PharmaShots, Tillman Gerngross, Ph.D., Co-Founder,<strong> and CEO of Adagio Therapeutics </strong>shed light on the pre-clinical data of<strong> </strong>ADG2 and how it works on SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>ADG2</strong> showed broad and potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV and two SARS-related coronaviruses currently known to be circulating in bat populations (WIV-1 and SHC014)</li><li>The company expects<strong> ADG20 </strong>to enter clinical studies in early 2021. <strong>Adagio Therapeutics </strong>has raised $130M in four months</li><li>ADG2 binds with high affinity to the 30 most frequently observed SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants reported in the GISAID database, including variants resistant to other monoclonal antibodies in the development</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we have a detail on the preclinical results of ADG2?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tillman:</strong><em> ADG2 (the precursor to ADG20) provided complete protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV disease in mouse models. When compared to other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in development, ADG2 showed similar or higher potency against SARS-CoV-2 in two authentic neutralization assays. ADG2 also showed broad and potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV and two SARS-related coronaviruses currently known to be circulating in bat populations (WIV-1 and SHC014).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additionally, ADG2 binds with high affinity to the 30 most frequently observed SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) variants reported in the GISAID database, including variants resistant to other monoclonal antibodies in development. Notably, no mutations have been reported at key ADG20 contact residues in full-length viral genomic sequences (>152,000) of SARS-CoV-2 included in the GISAID database as of October 19, 2020, suggesting a low risk of pre-existing resistance to ADG20 in the clinic.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the mechanism of action for ADG2 and how it works on SARS-CoV-2?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tillman:</strong><em> What makes ADG2 unique is the epitope it targets is highly conserved across clade 1 sarbecoviruses, it binds with high affinity to a large panel of clade I sarbecovirus receptor binding domains (RBDs). This is what we believe gives it best-in-class breadth against certain SARS-like coronaviruses. In terms of its MOA more generally, it acts as all monoclonal antibodies do – it binds to its target on the spike protein - this disables the virus’ ability to penetrate the cell.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the difference between ADG2 and ADG20? Where this is an oral or IV or IM formulation?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tillman:</strong><em> In vitro engineering of ADG2 avoided many of the common pitfalls associated with monoclonal antibody enhancements. Specifically, ADG2 demonstrated favorable biophysical properties in a series of in vitro assays that have been shown to be predictive of downstream behaviors such as serum half-life, ease of manufacturing, ability to formulate to high concentrations, and long-term stability. Adagio has engineered ADG2 to extend serum half-life and enhance mucosal localization, and this re-engineered molecule is ADG20.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you please shed some light on with comparators used in the study?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tillman:</strong><em> We compared ASG2 to multiple other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in development and ADG2 showed similar or higher potency against SARS-CoV-2 in two authentic neutralization assays. Additionally, ADG2 showed broad and potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV and two SARS-related coronaviruses currently known to be circulating in bat populations (WIV-1 and SHC014).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you think the ADG2/ADG20 will be eligible for the BTD, FT and PR from regulatory authorities?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tillman:</strong><em> We are working closely with the regulatory authorities to move ADG20 as quickly as possible through the clinic. We expect ADG20 to enter clinical studies in early 2021. The authorities have also been moving quickly with regard to COVID-19 treatments and vaccines, so it’s our hope we will receive the appropriate designations.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is Adagio planning to assess ADG2 in other SARS-like coronaviruses or any other infections?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tillman:</strong><em> Currently we are laser-focused on advancing ADG20 for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, however, we have good reason to believe it can also be highly effective against multiple other Clade-1 sarbecoviruses.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When is Adagio planning to initiate Ph I study and can you please share details of the design of this Ph I study?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tillman:</strong><em> We expect to enter clinical studies in early 2021. We have not yet disclosed details on the design of the study.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is Adagio undergoing more funding rounds? Do you have any future plans for an IPO?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tillman:</strong><em> Adagio has been well, and rapidly funded. We raised $130 million in four months. We have aggressive clinical plans for both treatment and prevention settings, so we do expect additional funding and likely we will access the public markets.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we have an insight into Adagio’s pipeline programs and their targeted indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tillman:</strong><em> Currently we are focused on advancing ADG20 for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. But our scientists have shown an ability to rapidly develop novel antibodies against emerging viruses including SARS, COVID-19, and Ebola. We believe new viruses will continue to emerge, and SARS-like coronaviruses historically have the highest track record of jumping to humans. If ADG-20 can’t address the next pandemic directly, we have high confidence we can rapidly develop an antibody that can.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you looking for a collaboration to develop and commercialize your therapies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tillman:</strong><em> We remain focused on advancing ADG20 but we have not ruled out any potential business engagements that will enable us to do this more quickly or efficiently, including various financing or partnering strategies.</em></p>

<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>We were pleased that the results of Phase 1b/2a study of our innate cell engager (ICE) AFM13 as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive lymphoma with cutaneous involvement have been presented at this year’s American Society of Hematology virtual meeting. The study showed an objective response rate of 42 percent (6/14 patients) and demonstrated clinical activity in two out of four patients with failure of brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are excited about the results of this study, as the data suggest that AFM13 initiates NK cell tumor infiltration and recruits and engages NK cells for tumor cell killing. AFM13 was well tolerated and showed a promising objective response rate in patients with a high therapeutic need.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the importance of NK cells in achieving the anti-tumor responses?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>Natural killer cells are powerful innate immune cells that are a part of the body’s first line of defense and have the ability to trigger a complete immune response. However, in cancer patients, NK cells can become compromised, or tumor cells may escape their recognition.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Utilizing our Redirected Optimized Cell Killing (ROCK) platform, we develop tetravalent, bispecific ICE molecules that possess strong cell-retention binding to NK cells and macrophages and effectively direct these innate immune cells to the tumor target to kill cancer. Combining our ICE molecules with adoptive NK cell transfer is currently under investigation in a Phase 1 trial and aims to ensure that patients have sufficient active NK cells to be directed to the tumor and induce tumor cell killing. &nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the mechanism of action of AFM13?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>AFM13, our lead, late-stage ICE<sup> </sup>molecule, represents a new approach of activating the innate immune system in the fight against CD30-positive lymphoma. AFM13 redirects NK cells and macrophages to tumor cells by binding to CD16A on innate immune cells and CD30 on cancer cells. The innate immune cells then kill the tumor cell through Antibody-Dependent Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC) or Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you summarize the presentation &amp; abstracts presented at ASH in a non-scientific way?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>We were honored that data around our lead ICE molecule, AFM13, were presented this year at the American Society of Hematology virtual annual meeting. We were particularly excited about the Phase 1a/2b data which analyzed the safety and efficacy of AFM13 in patients with CD30-positive lymphoma who were heavily pretreated and were relapsed or refractory to prior therapies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The study revealed that AFM13 as monotherapy was well tolerated and demonstrated a promising objective response rate, with 42 percent of patients showing either a partial or complete response.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we have a glance at your ROCK platform?</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>Affimed’s ROCK platform is based on the scientific approach of leveraging a patient’s innate immune system in the fight against cancer, which has remained largely untapped as a therapeutic approach in oncology.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our ROCK platform is the most clinically advanced technology platform for developing innate immunity therapies. By leveraging a CD16A-binding epitope, our platform is able to generate ICE molecules that mimic the natural way the human body employs the innate immune system to effectively fight cancer. The modular nature of the platform also allows for the tailoring of ICE molecules for new therapeutic indications.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The ROCK platform is the foundation of our growth strategy because of its ability to generate a plethora of diverse ICE molecules for a multitude of hematologic and solid tumor cancers with consistent profiles in tumor lysis and safety.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the different indications in which Affimed is evaluating AFM13?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>We are currently evaluating AFM13 as a monotherapy for the treatment of CD30-positive lymphoma, including Hodgkin lymphoma, peripheral T cell lymphoma and transformed mycosis fungoides. Additionally, AFM13 is being assessed as combination therapy with adoptive NK cells or a checkpoint inhibitor in CD30-positive lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We were honored to announce that the </em>results of the Phase 1 combination study with AFM13 and Merck’s KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) were published in the esteemed Blood journal last month. The study showed a complete response (CR) rate of 46 percent and an objective response rate (ORR<em>) of 88 percent in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. As a monotherapy, KEYTRUDA demonstrated an ORR of 69% and a CR of 22.4% in the KEYNOTE-087 trial. These data support the scientific rationale for combining innate cell engagers with checkpoint inhibitors.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Please showcase Affimed’s diverse clinical pipeline of innate cell engagers designed to activate innate immunity?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>Our ROCKplatform was created to generate diverse, CD16A-targeting ICE molecules, which can be customized for a variety of specific tumor targets. Our broad clinical pipeline is comprised of a number of wholly-owned programs, as well as a number of out-licensed programs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>AFM13 is our lead candidate, targeting CD30 and is in development for CD30-positive lymphomas. A registration-directed Phase 2 study in peripheral T-cell lymphoma is underway. In addition, AFM13 is being investigated as combination partner, with a checkpoint inhibitor and adoptive NK cells.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>AFM24 targets EGFR on solid tumors. Its mechanism of action through the activation of NK cells and macrophages is differentiated from other EGFR-targeting therapies. A phase 1 study with AFM24 monotherapy is ongoing and a combination study with adoptive NK cells is in preparation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additionally, we are developing several novel ICE molecules with undisclosed tumor targets through partnered programs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: List out your preclinical innate cell engagers targeting hematologic and solid tumors?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>The ROCK platform enables us to develop ICE molecules for various tumor targets. The platform’s modularity allows us to customize the ICEformats according to tumor targets, PK and other characteristics.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>AFM28 and AFM32 are currently being developed to treat several undisclosed targets. We recently licensed AFM32 to Roivant Sciences for an upfront consideration of $60 million, with options to develop additional ICEmolecules for new tumor targets not included in our current pipeline.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are excited about this partnership as it further validates our platform and scientific expertise in the selection of promising targets to develop ICE molecules in oncology indications where there is an unmet need.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you highlight Affimed’s alliances with other global companies? Is Affimed looking for more collaborations to develop its clinical programs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>We are always looking for opportunities to explore innovative collaborations to further accelerate our robust pipeline and support our vision of stopping cancer from derailing patients’ lives.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In 2018 we entered a collaboration with Genentech that has proven to be very fruitful.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In 2020 we announced new collaborations with leaders in the field of NK cell products – NKMax America and Artiva Biotherapeutics – and with Roivant Sciences.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our partnerships with NKMax America and Artiva will explore the potential of combining ICE molecules with NK cell products to maximize innate immune responses. We have granted Roivant license to AFM32 with options for additional ICE molecules directed against targets beyond our current pipeline.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you think Affimed’s therapies can overcome the limitations and challenges faced by current I-O therapies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>Immuno-oncology is a broad field presenting multiple areas of scientific innovation, advancement and discovery. While current immuno-oncology therapies largely ignore the innate immune system, we believe it provides new opportunities for long-lasting, multi-layered tumor control. In addition to activating innate immune cells for directed tumor cell killing, the innate immune system stimulates the cross-talk to adaptive immune cells, triggering a total immune response.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The differentiated mechanism of action of our ICE molecules is designed for improved tolerability.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: AFM13 holds promise as monotherapy and in combinations. Comment over the statement.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong> <em>As demonstrated by our recent presentation at the American Society of Hematology virtual meeting, AFM13 was well-tolerated as a monotherapy and reached a high objective response rate among heavily pretreated patients with CD30-positive lymphoma. A registration-directed Phase 2 study with AFM13 as a monotherapy in patients with CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma is currently ongoing.</em><em> </em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition, AFM13 is also being explored as a combination therapy. Recently published in Blood, a Phase 1b study with AFM13 and Merck’s KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) achieved a complete response rate (CR) of 46 percent and an overall response rate (ORR) of 88 percent in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. As a monotherapy, KEYTRUDA demonstrated an ORR of 69 percent and a CR of 22.4 percent. These data support the scientific rationale for combining innate cell engagers with checkpoint inhibitors.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>A Phase 1 study with AFM13 in combination with adoptive NK cells was initiated in 2020. Pre-clinical data of this combination have been promising, revealing the potential benefits that preloading an NK cell product with an ICE<sup>®</sup> could have in the treatment of patients suffering from blood cancers.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are psychedelics? Can these therapies be a game-changer in mental health?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr.</strong> Malcolm: Psychedelics are a class of substances that induce a heightened state of consciousness characterized by a hyperconnected brain state. Psilocybin, a psychedelic compound found in mushrooms is the most commonly known psychedelic substance and in a seminal paper released on the 15th of April of this year,<em> it was shown how this compound may be just as effective as conventional antidepressants.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As we are well aware, the world is experiencing a devastating physical health emergency, with the coronavirus. However, experts warn that without a renewed focus on our psychological well-being, the true effect of the Coronavirus will be significantly more devastating. Loneliness, uncertainty, and grief have only been intensifying an already acute mental health crisis. Antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs have been shown to be relatively ineffective and too often leave patients untreated. These confounding factors highlight a societal need for innovation in the way we treat mental health and it is clear that psychedelics could be this breakthrough.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Share the unique works of Albert Labs with our readers.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Malcolm: </strong>Albert Labs is a laboratory-based, clinical research and drug development enterprise focused on improving patient access to psychedelic-assisted therapies through the safe, timely,<em> and efficient development of medicines across Europe.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We employ a blue ocean strategy that focuses on treating niche mental health indications that big pharma or psychedelics drug companies are not addressing including cancer-related anxiety. There are over 3 million cancer patients in the UK with about half suffering from anxiety. So although this is a niche indication, 1.3 million people is a sizable addressable market. This is closer to 5 million in the US.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Because patients suffering from this indication have an urgent and unmet need, Albert Labs will use an accelerated pathway sanctioned in the UK and Europe to get its proprietary natural psilocybin medicine approved and to patients quickly.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss your business model and your plans for scaling the psychedelics therapies.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Malcolm: </strong>Albert Labs is forming collaborations among research institutions, medical centers, and reimbursement networks in the UK and across Europe. This is an asset-light business model as it leverages the <em>existing clinical infrastructure and patient pools through its collaborations.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We plan to scale these collaborations to generate revenue, ensure research institutions are published, and provide patients with faster access to urgently needed mental health treatment solutions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additional studies on cancer-related anxiety will be carried out in other European countries to further develop and protect Albert Labs’ therapies while addressing other niche mental health indications.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Albert Labs essentially raises capital to fund these accelerated trials through collaborations. Albert Labs will own the study data to improve and protect its psychedelic-based therapies in its laboratories to create a valuable IP strategy.&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Albert Labs has submitted applications for psychedelic research and a dealer’s license which will allow the Company to test, possess, buy and sell MDMA, psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, and mescaline in its lab in Burnaby, BC Canada. These Health Canada licenses will also allow the company to import/export, test, and conduct R&amp;D on these controlled substances.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;</strong><strong>How is Albert Labs different from other companies dealing with psychedelics?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Malcolm:</strong> <em>Albert Labs will be the first psychedelics company to use an accelerated pathway, known as Real-World Evidence (RWE) studies, to gain approval and reimbursement for its proprietary therapy to treat patients in urgent need. RWE studies are much faster and cheaper to conduct and commercialize approved medicine compared to RCT trials and have been used recently to bring COVID-19 vaccines to market at a rapid pace. It is clear there is now a case to use this more widely and we believe Psilocybin medicines are a perfect use case due to the inarguable safety of these compounds, proven through millennia of use and most recently through RCTs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;</strong><strong>Are you open to investors to receive funding for your innovative company? How can interested parties contact you?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Malcolm:</strong> <em>Albert Labs has its Series A round underway raising C$4M at C$0.25 and previously closed its seed round of C$350K with strategic investors. Venture capital funds including The Conscious Fund (TCF) and Ambria Fund have both invested in the Seed and the concurrent Series A. Accredited investors and funds can visit our site to learn more about investing in Albert Labs and to contact us directly <a href=""https://albertlabs.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://albertlabs.com</a></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>For retail investors, Albert Labs will be going public on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) in the May/June time frame.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Do you feel competition in this space? If yes, who are your potential threats?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Malcolm:</strong> <em>Albert Labs' blue ocean strategy and asset-light model separates us from the influx of psychedelics companies that are attempting to develop a novel / synthetic version of a naturally occurring psychedelic compound or a network of clinics to treat patients and collect data. Both of these endeavors are capital and time-intensive.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Albert is agile and will produce results and revenue quickly so that it can continue growing its brand and patient access across the UK and Europe.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In terms of competition, other companies are not focusing on the same indications in the same jurisdictions. As explained, these companies are carrying out timely and costly endeavors to recreate novel versions of these well-established medicines. Our strategy is unique, revolving around Real-World Evidence we want to treat patients faster. With the increasing awareness and adoption of RWE studies, we believe we can collect wider data sets that lays out safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness evidence to support the licensing of our medicines in the UK.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This doesn’t come at the detriment of protection. We have a clear IP strategy that will protect us from the competition and will protect our addressable market. In addition to tangible and legal IP protection, by getting out there and treating patients sooner we will benefit from a strong first-mover advantage which will be highly regarded with patients and clinicians and enable our company to quickly expand. We remain focused and have clear values on getting these breakthrough therapies to patients who are in need. Patients who currently go untreated.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How is your collaboration in the UK and EU helping you to scale up the therapies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Malcolm:</strong> Through a collaboration it makes certain that all the key stakeholders are aligned to make Psychedelic Assisted therapy a successful treatment solution. In simple terms researchers can author highly regarded medical publications, hospital centers,<em> and their in-house multidisciplinary teams can see patients treated, and finally, the payers reimburse fairly for life-changing treatment and for increased quality of life of these patients. By ensuring an effective working collaboration Albert Labs can stimulate faster patient acquisition and scale to other EU jurisdictions which also highly regard Real World Evidence and have similar reimbursement networks to the ones in the UK.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Put some light on your Real-World Evidence studies. Also, discuss its significance.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Malcolm:</strong> <em>Real-World Evidence a clinical pathway that enables Albert Labs to collect clinically relevant and significant data to support drug development and licensing applications whilst in turn treating patients in the hospital setting who are in need. As previously mentioned, too often patients go untreated for their psychological distress, and current treatment options are ineffective or simply not provided to oncology patients. Through this differentiated pathway, we can not only further the development of our medicines but also treat patients. This is extremely significant, it’s a well-understood advantage over Randomised Controlled Trials.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The breadth of the data that can be collected is also superior and that enables us to answer wider questions, such as which patients will be most effective for this treatment? How does it compare with other treatments? How cost-effective is it? How will it fit into the current healthcare system? what happens in actual clinical practice and use that to inform treatment and reimbursement decisions.&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Share some exclusive information about the company and its plans in the near future with our readers.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Malcolm:</strong> <em>Our plans are to redirect the current course of mental health treatments across the globe towards ethical and efficacious pathways that will see a real benefit to patients, improving the lives of those who are currently undertreated and suffering. In terms of the near future, we will commence the first stages of our clinical trials towards the end of 2021, adopting the Real-World Evidence approach that will allow for accelerated patient access.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are the first company to use</em> a Real World Evidence strategy. We believe this is a suitable, credible, and advanced way to conduct clinical research into the novel therapy model surrounding psychedelics. Real-World<em> Evidence is quickly becoming a credible pathway that has seen support by the MHRA &amp; NICE, and this is a unique strategy in the sector</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Sophia</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>CD47 is a marker of self and when bound to its SIRPa receptor on myeloid cells provides an anti-phagocytic signal that spares the CD47 expressing cell from the innate immune response. Tumor cells overexpress CD47 to evade the macrophage component of immune surveillance.</em></li><li><em>Phagocytosis of the tumor cell requires both the activation of pro-phagocytic signals and the disruption of the CD47-SIRPa myeloid checkpoint. Neither component alone is sufficient to trigger maximal phagocytic activity against tumor cells.</em></li><li><em>ALX148, a high-affinity CD47 blocker, provides the blockade of the myeloid checkpoint signal. The pro-phagocytic signal can be provided to the same macrophages by zanidatamab’s Fc gamma domain binding to the Fc gamma receptors (Fc?Rs) to selectively direct the anticancer immune response to the HER2-expressing breast cancer cells.&nbsp; As a therapeutic antibody, zanidatamab targets the HER2 receptor, and can also induce cellular phagocytosis, but through a slightly different mechanism.</em></li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the Mechanism of Action of both therapies? How they are complementing each other?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sophia</strong>: &nbsp;<em>By coupling ALX148’s blockade of the CD47 SIRPa myeloid checkpoint to the pro-phagocytic and tumor-selective signal provided by zanidatamab Fc gamma receptor, it is possible to selectively direct the anticancer immune response to the HER2 expressing breast cancer cells. Zanidatamab directs macrophages to cancer cells by binding to the tumor-specific antigen and activating the macrophage by engaging the Fc? receptors to induce phagocytosis. However, if CD47 is not blocked, the myeloid checkpoint signal can limit the activity of this mechanism. Therefore, ALX148 may maximize zanidatamab's clinical activity by overcoming the myeloid checkpoint signal that is co-opted by cancer cells.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thierry: </strong><em>AZP-3601 is a therapeutic peptide analog of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) designed to target a specific configuration of the PTH receptor (PTHR), to have a short half-life and to produce a long pharmacodynamic effect.</em><a><em> </em></a><em>This particular profile is intended to produce sustained normal levels of calcium in the blood and thereby mitigate some of the numerous and life-altering symptoms of hypoparathyroidism.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>AZP-3601 may also decrease hypercalciuria, which would in turn aid in preventing long-term complications such as chronic kidney disease, which is commonly seen when calcium and vitamin D supplementation are used to treat hypoparathyroidism. In addition, AZP-3601 is expected to have a neutral effect on the bone, which would potentially be a key advantage, since a high percentage of women with hypoparathyroidism are middle-aged women at risk of developing osteoporosis, a condition characterized by weak and brittle bones.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This specific mode of action and profile has been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies, and we are now starting to confirm these findings in humans, starting with healthy volunteers and then moving to hypoparathyroidism patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Highlight the key findings of the data presented at ENDO 2021.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thierry: </strong><em>We presented positive data from the single ascending dose (SAD) portion of our Phase 1 trial evaluating our lead clinical candidate, AZP-3601.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the first four cohorts of the SAD, double-blind trial, in healthy volunteers aged 18-60 years, </em><em>AZP-3601 treatment produced a clear, dose-dependent increase in the average blood calcium levels, adjusted for albumin levels, as compared with placebo controls. In healthy volunteers who received 40 micrograms of AZP-3601, the highest dose for which we have reported data so far, average albumin-adjusted blood calcium levels were significantly increased, but stayed within normal laboratory range, and remained elevated through at least 24 hours post-administration. As expected, a dose-dependent decrease in the level of endogenous PTH was also observed, correlating with the increased calcium level.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>These data provide initial clinical evidence that AZP-3601 may lead to a long-acting response following a single administration, even after AZP-3601 is rapidly cleared from the body. We believe the quick clearance of AZP-3601 from the body is ideal for patients with hypoparathyroidism because constant exposure of the PTHR to natural PTH has been linked to a decrease in bone mineral density, a potential risk for the majority of patients with hypoparathyroidism, who are middle-aged women at risk of osteoporosis.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the design of the P-I trial to assess AZP-3601 for hypoparathyroidism.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thierry: </strong><em>The ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of AZP-3601 following single and multiple ascending doses (MAD) in healthy subjects, as well as in patients with hypoparathyroidism.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We expect to enroll around 130 subjects in this trial and anticipate completion of both the SAD and MAD portions of the trial in healthy subjects in mid-2021. We expect the results of the MAD trial in patients will be available in the first half of 2022</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can you shed some light on the unique mechanism of AZP-3601, its RoA, formulation and other details?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thierry: </strong><em>AZP-3601 is the first PTH analog designed to preferentially target the Rº configuration of the PTH receptor to stimulate calcium reabsorption by the kidneys to restore and maintain sCa level within the normal range and to prevent hypercalciuria and chronic kidney disease. Pre-clinical data demonstrated that thanks to its short half-life, AZP-3601 doesn’t continuously activate the R<sup>G</sup> configuration of the PTH1 receptor, which may, in turn, reduce the risk of bone resorption linked to continuously elevated levels of PTH.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>AZP-3601 is formulated as a once-daily subcutaneous injection, and we are also currently developing a multi-dose pen device intended to make self-administration by patients easier and more comfortable.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Orphan Drug Designation to AZP-3601 in January 2021.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the symptoms, causes, diagnosis and pathophysiology of Hypoparathyroidism.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thierry: </strong><em>Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder that is characterized by a deficiency in PTH resulting in dysregulation of calcium and phosphorus, two essential minerals in the body.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>There are approximately 80,000 and 110,000 people with hypoparathyroidism in the United States&nbsp;and European Union, respectively, of which about 80% are women. More than two-thirds of women with hypoparathyroidism are peri- and menopausal women who are at an increased risk of developing osteoporosis. It is estimated that about 25% of people with hypoparathyroidism have chronic kidney disease or kidney failure, highlighting the importance of reducing urinary calcium excretion as a key treatment goal.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Most cases of hypoparathyroidism are due to damage or removal of the parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery, but hypoparathyroidism may also be inherited or due to an immune system problem or an unknown cause. Regardless of the underlying cause, any patient with hypoparathyroidism may experience numerous symptoms.<sup>1,<a href=""#_ftn1""><strong>[1]</strong></a></sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Clinical manifestations of hypoparathyroidism vary and impact a large number of tissues and organ systems, including the muscles, brain, heart, and kidneys. Despite available treatments, patients frequently experience persistent, life-altering symptoms and reduced quality of life. In addition, they often develop kidney disease and have abnormal bone architecture.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are the different programs targeting different diseases in your portfolio?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thierry: </strong><em>In addition to AZP-3601, our pipeline includes AZP-38XX and AZP-3404.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In collaboration with PeptiDream Inc., through our AZP-38XX program, we are testing a series of novel, small peptide antagonists of the growth hormone receptor to select a lead development candidate for the potential treatment of acromegaly.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In parallel, we are exploring the pharmacology and potential target indications for AZP-3404, a therapeutic peptide that may restore fat and glucose metabolism in the body.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are the limitations for the current treatment of hypoparathyroidism? How may AZP-3601 overcome them?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thierry:</strong><em> </em><em>Conventional therapies for patients with hypoparathyroidism include calcium supplements and activated vitamin D in the form of calcitriol, ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol in the United States or alpha calcidol in the European Union. This treatment regimen has limited efficacy and requires multiple daily doses that can lead to compliance issues. Long-term treatment with these therapies may lead to dangerously high levels of calcium in the urine causing kidney stones and impaired kidney function.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Recombinant human PTH [(1-84) [rhPTH (1-84)] is a once-daily injection under the skin that is also approved as a treatment for adult patients with hypoparathyroidism who do not respond to conventional therapies, but, due to its short pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, it typically fails to regulate levels of calcium in the body for 24 hours, resulting in poor symptom control. It also has a very limited effect on urine calcium excretion.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Therapies that adequately regulate blood calcium levels over twenty-four hours to control symptoms, avoid elevated urine calcium levels to prevent kidney disease, and maintain bone integrity are urgently needed to restore quality of life for patients with hypoparathyroidism.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What next can we expect from Amolyt Pharma to potentially improve the lives of patients with hypoparathyroidism?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thierry: </strong><em>We are pursuing an ambitious Phase I program with the goals of demonstrating proof-of-concept and rapidly advancing AZP-3601 for the potential treatment of patients with hypoparathyroidism. We are encouraged by the early results presented at ENDO 2021, and we look forward to reporting additional data from the multiple ascending dose portion of the trial in healthy subjects later this year and in the first half of 2022 for the MAD study in patients.</em></p>

Highlights include:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""type"":""a""} -->
<ol type=""a""><li><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></strong><em>. In collaboration with the Ophthalmic Image Analysis (OPTIMA) group at the Medical University of Vienna, we presented five oral presentations evaluating AI as a tool to identify, monitor, and predict the growth of GA lesions. The analyses were performed on imaging data from our <a href=""https://investors.apellis.com/news-releases/news-release-details/apellis-announces-new-analysis-demonstrating-targeted-c3-therapy"">positive Phase 2 FILLY study</a></em><em> and confirmed the findings from FILLY, showing that intravitreal pegcetacoplan significantly reduced the growth rate of GA lesions. The data demonstrated that AI can rapidly, distinctly, and reliably measure disease progression as well as therapeutic efficacy in GA. We are particularly excited by the potential of the technology to guide treatment decisions and improve overall outcomes for people living with GA.</em></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong><em>GA.</em></strong><em> We presented a 24-month update of our Phase 1b study of pegcetacoplan in patients with GA secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and low vision. The trial was designed to assess the safety of the Phase 3 intravitreal formulation of pegcetacoplan (15mg/0.1mL). The post hoc analysis included eight bilateral patients (disease in both eyes) for whom data were available for at least 24 months. Among the participants, the growth rate of GA lesions in the treated eye was 46% slower than in the untreated fellow eye. There were no reported cases of inflammation with the new formulation among study participants, and two patients developed new-onset exudation during the 24-month study duration, consistent with findings from the FILLY.</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Although the study included a limited patient population, the 24-month data give us confidence in the Phase 3 DERBY and OAKS studies of pegcetacoplan in GA. We look forward to sharing DERBY and OAKS top-line results later this year in Q3.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong><em>GA and Wet AMD.</em></strong><em> We also shared results from a Phase 1b/2, 18-month, open-label study evaluating the safety of pegcetacoplan in 17 patients with wet AMD also being treated with anti-VEGF therapies, standard approved medicines for wet AMD. The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events were either mild or moderate. The study showed that pegcetacoplan in combination with anti-VEGF therapy in patients with wet AMD appears to be safe and well-tolerated.</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong><em>Real-world clinical data</em></strong><em>. In collaboration with Verana Health, we presented data from our analysis of the IRIS Registry, the largest real-world clinical database in GA. The retrospective study included more than 69,000&nbsp;patients diagnosed with GA and analyzed&nbsp;changes in&nbsp;visual acuity and disease progression for over two years, as well as the occurrence of concurrent wet AMD.&nbsp;The data showed significant disease progression over the two-year period, highlighting the urgent need for treatment. Data also revealed that patients with wet AMD were also nearly three times more likely to develop&nbsp;new-onset&nbsp;wet AMD in an eye with GA when wet AMD had already been detected in the fellow eye.</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong><em>Phase 2 FILLY Analysis.</em></strong><em> Finally, we presented an exciting post hoc analysis&nbsp;of our positive&nbsp;Phase 2&nbsp;FILLY study&nbsp;that showed a&nbsp;39% reduction&nbsp;in the rate of progression&nbsp;from&nbsp;nascent GA,&nbsp;an&nbsp;earlier&nbsp;form&nbsp;of the disease,&nbsp;to GA&nbsp;in patients treated with monthly pegcetacoplan versus sham injections. In the analysis, progression from nascent GA to GA was observed in 50.0% of the pegcetacoplan-treated group and 81.8% of the sham-treated group. This first-ever&nbsp;observation of slowed nascent GA&nbsp;progression&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Phase 2 study indicates a&nbsp;potential&nbsp;benefit from&nbsp;earlier intervention&nbsp;with pegcetacoplan&nbsp;in patients with GA.</em></li></ul>

<p><strong>Tuba: Can we discuss more the epidemiology (incidence, prevalence, etc) and more details on geography atrophy?<br><br>Federico: </strong><em>GA is an advanced form of AMD that leads to progressive destruction of the retina, causing visual impairment and eventually blindness. More than 5 million people worldwide have GA, including one million people in the U.S. This is a disease that severely degrades visual function, independence, and quality of life because it impacts essential everyday activities like driving and reading. While there are multiple effective treatments available for wet AMD, there are no approved treatments for GA.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What other indications is Apellis assessing for pegcetacoplan?<br><br>Federico: </strong><em>We recently received <a href=""https://investors.apellis.com/news-releases/news-release-details/apellis-announces-us-food-and-drug-administration-fda-approval"">FDA approval</a> of pegcetacoplan, with the brand name EMPAVELI, for adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is a rare blood disease. With our partner Sobi, we have also submitted applications to other global regulatory agencies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Targeting C3 has treatment potential across several therapeutic areas, and our pipeline reflects that promise. We are currently evaluating pegcetacoplan in GA, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN), and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation thrombotic microangiopathies (HSCT-TMA), and cold agglutinin disease (CAD)<a>. </a>As you can see, our research spans several rare diseases in neurology, nephrology, and hematology in addition to ophthalmology.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are pegcetacoplan MoA and its different formulations?</strong><br><br><strong>Federico: </strong><em>Pegcetacoplan targets C3, the central protein of the complement cascade. C3 is the only target that controls all of the three complement activation pathways that can drive disease. We have a formulation for systemic diseases such as PNH and an intravitreal formulation for delivery into the eye in geographic atrophy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the correlation between ophthalmology, hematology, nephrology &amp; neurology. How one molecule target all the indications?<br><br>Federico: </strong><em>That’s a great question. At the surface, these diseases are all completely different, but when you look a layer deeper, they are all driven by excessive complement activation. Complement defends the body against infection. When functioning normally, its role is to recognize and eliminate pathogens, foreign and damaged material. However, when complement is overactivated, it can attack and destroy healthy cells and tissue, leading to numerous diseases, including the ones we are researching.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How can this therapy be beneficial in patients with GA?</strong><br><strong>Federico: </strong><em>GA lesions are dying areas of the retina that grow progressively and cause visual impairment and eventual blindness. Our positive Phase 2 FILLY study has demonstrated that pegcetacoplan significantly reduces the growth rate of GA lesions. We completed enrollment of DERBY and OAKS, our Phase</em> 3 studies in GA, and look forward to sharing top-line results from these pivotal studies in Q3 of this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is there any patient support program for pegcetacoplan?</strong><br><strong>Federico: </strong>With our US approval in PNH, we do offer patient support for EMPAVELI through our ApellisAssist program. As of now, we are still in the process of studying the efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan for GA, so we need to learn more about <em>investigational therapy before implementing patient support programs in this area. However, Apellis is committed to improving the lives of patients, so assuming positive results in Q3, we will work urgently to address how we can bring pegcetacoplan to GA patients. &nbsp;</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can you discuss the epidemiology of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gail:</strong><em>  Kidney cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and is among the 10 most common cancers in both men and women. Metastasis to distant organs including the lung, bone, liver, and brain is the primary cause of death in kidney cancer patients as only 12% of metastatic kidney cancer will survive past 5 years. According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that there will be approximately 76,080 new cases of kidney cancer and 13,780 people will die from this disease in the United States during 2021.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a cancer of the kidney. Genetic predisposition conditions, e.g., von Hippel Lindau syndrome which involves a genetic mutation in VHL, a tumor suppressor gene controlling tumor initiation in ~90% of ccRCC tumors, may contribute to the development of this type of cancer.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Why Aravive has committed to investigate AVB-500 in ccRCC patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gail:</strong><em>  Aravive’s scientific founder, Dr. Amato Giaccia, identified the GAS6/AXL pathway is critical for cancer cell survival from a VHL lethal screen. As noted above, 90% of ccRCC tumors have a genetic mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene and AXL and GAS6 expression are upregulated as a result. As such, ccRCC expresses the target of AVB-500, Aravive’s lead compound.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Importantly, AVB-500, the lead compound being tested in ccRCC, has been tested in preclinical models of ccRCC and demonstrated an effect in reducing metastasis and reversing resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., sorafenib).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the clinical trial design of Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of AVB-500 in patients with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gail:</strong><em>  The trial has a dose-escalation (P1b) portion to test doses of 15, 20 and 25mg/kg AVB-500 administered IV every 2 weeks in combination with daily cabozantinib. The 20 and 25mg/kg doses are higher than what we are testing in our P3 platinum-resistant ovarian cancer registrational trial because cabozantinib is known to increase serum GAS6 levels (target of AVB-500) and higher doses of AVB-500 may be required to fully suppress serum GAS6 levels. We know from our preclinical studies that full suppression of serum GAS6 is required for anti-tumor activity. Importantly, the safety profile of AVB-500 has been favorable and neither preclinical toxicology studies nor clinical studies impose a limit to the AVB-500 dose that we can test.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We expect to select the P2 dose based on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (specifically, serum GAS6 suppression), and safety by the end of 3Q2021. Clinical activity will also be collected for the patients in the P1b portion. The P2 portion of this trial is an open-label, randomized, controlled trial comparing AVB-500 + cabozantinib vs cabozantinib with the objective of assessing clinical activity assessed by investigator-assessed RECIST V1.1 criteria for progression-free survival. This trial will continue throughout 2022.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the working on AVB-500 and its potential against ccRCC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gail:</strong><em>  The biological rationale for testing AVB-500 as a treatment for ccRCC is strong. The literature demonstrates AXL plays a significant role in ccRCC invasion &amp; metastasis, is highly expressed in aggressive ccRCC tumors, and associated with poor outcome, and high levels of GAS6 and/or AXL are associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival in ccRCC. As such, GAS6/AXL signaling pathway is an established therapeutic target to prevent/treat metastatic ccRCC. As noted above, 90% of ccRCC</em> <em>tumors have a genetic mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene and AXL and GAS6 expression are upregulated as a result. As such, ccRCC is associated with activation of the GAS6/AXL pathway, the target of AVB-500.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Importantly, AVB-500, the lead compound being tested in ccRCC, has been tested in preclinical models of ccRCC and demonstrated an effect in reducing metastasis and reversing resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., sorafenib).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Do you think disruption of GAS6/AXL signaling can be the potential approach in treating cancer?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":58389,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/approach.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-58389""/><figcaption><strong>Source: Aravive</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gail:</strong><em>  There is a wealth of publications over the past 2 decades showing the association of high levels of GAS6 and AXL with poor prognosis and survival in cancer patients. The pathway is implicated in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition which results in a tumor cell migrating, invading, and growing over healthy tissue (i.e., metastasizing). The pathway is also upregulated in tumor cells that have become resistant to a number of anticancer drugs, including chemotherapies, biologics, and checkpoint inhibitors. However, targeting the pathway has proven challenging for a few reasons. First, the binding affinity between endogenous AXL and GAS6 is very high, making it challenging to disrupt the interaction. Second, AXL is a kinase but small drug kinase inhibitors target the region of kinases that are highly conserved across other kinases, typically resulting in a promiscuous inhibitor. Aravive’s lead candidate, AVB-500, is an AXL decoy protein that has been engineered to bind to GAS6, the sole activator of AXL, with a much higher affinity than the endogenous AXL protein. As such, AVB-500 captures and removes GAS6 so that it is not available to bind and activate AXL. This is a unique approach with the potential for AVB-500 to be a “best-in-class” therapeutic as there are no other drugs or development candidates that target GAS6.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We know from our preclinical program that the higher the affinity of the AXL decoy protein, the better the antitumor activity. AVB-500 has a 200-fold higher affinity than the endogenous AXL protein and it has demonstrated antitumor activity in a number of preclinical cancer studies. We also know that suppression of serum GAS6 (using our proprietary biomarker assay) is required for the antitumor effect. Importantly, we have demonstrated clinical activity in combination with paclitaxel in a platinum-resistant ovarian cancer population at a dose that suppresses serum GAS6 levels. All of our data thus far show a clear association between suppression of this pathway and the antitumor effect.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are the indications in which you are evaluating or plans to evaluate your lead candidate? Can we know reason behind discontinuation of IgAN program?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gail:</strong><em> &nbsp;Aravive made the decision last year to focus on oncology and that is the reason we decided to discontinue the IgAN program.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are currently doing in our P1b/P2 ccRCC trial, have initiated the P3 platinum-resistant ovarian cancer trial, and have two investigator-sponsored trials (ISTs) ongoing. The ISTs are in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and bladder cancer in combination with anti-PD-L1 proteins. Given the wealth of preclinical data for AVB-500, we could potentially go into any number of cancers and all lines of therapy. We’d like to initiate some “basket” single-arm trials by the end of 2021 that would investigate AVB-500 in numerous cancers and in multiple combinations simultaneously to quickly explore and expand the pipeline</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What we can expect from the company in terms of initiating clinical studies, announcing results in 2021?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gail:</strong><em>  Aravive is focused on the P3 platinum-resistant ovarian cancer program and we expect to dose a patient soon. We received advice from FDA on our program last year and this one P3 trial, if successful, could support the registration of AVB-500 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The preclinical and clinical pharmacology programs are complete so this is the last trial needed. We do have an interim analysis planned for Q12022 during which we will assess the potential to see a treatment effect in patients who had previously been on bevacizumab prior to trial entry. This is important as our P1b data suggest the effect is lower in such patients and this will provide the opportunity to only include patients who have never received bevacizumab as our P1b data showed those patients did very well. (Of note, this phenomenon has been noted with other cancer therapies and may be related to bevacizumab’s effect on decreasing the tumor vasculature, resulting in decreased delivery of the subsequent anticancer therapy to the tumor.) The adaptive design affords us the opportunity to continue with the trial without any disruption and complete the trial with the highest chance of success.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The ccRCC trial will be ongoing for the next 2 years and will be open-label and will provide safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and potentially clinical activity data over this time.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss your collaborations with other companies. Are you looking for more collaboration in advancing your lead product in other indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gail:</strong><em>  We will always be opportunistic and consider opportunities that come our way. We are very excited about the safety profile and clinical activity of AVB-500 and want to see this drug tested in as many indications and lines of therapy as possible.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we have more details on Aravive’s product pipeline?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gail:</strong><em> &nbsp;Below is a picture of our current pipeline. At this time, it does not include expansion into basket trials mentioned above. In addition to the trials in PROC and ccRCC and the two ISTs, we have a discovery program in collaboration with WuXi Biologics. The focus of that program is to develop bispecific antibodies to CTGF (also known as CCN2) that is a clinically validated target for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (or IPF) and pancreatic cancer. Our approach is unique and could provide a best-in-class therapeutic. The investigational new drug application (IND) for this program, allowing us to initiate clinical trials, is expected in 2023.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Put lights on synthetic cannabinoids, their relevancy, and the other opportunities that can arise from modulating the ECS.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Saoirse O'Sullivan:</strong><em> Nature has provided us with hundreds of molecules in the phytocannabinoid (plant-derived) and endocannabinoid (made in our bodies) family. Research tells us that these compounds can be very useful in treating a wide range of diseases and disorders from epilepsy to anxiety to cancer. However, these molecules are not perfectly adapted for improving human health; many are very insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body, some are not very potent, many are found in tiny quantities. Producing these molecules synthetically, or improving their physical, chemical, and biological properties through medicinal chemistry programs allows us to harness the best of what nature provides us. Commercially, this also allows for the creation of Intellectual Property (IP) which is crucial to attracting investment for the expensive development of new medicines.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What motivates you to develop an entirely synthetic cannabinoid for Cancer Anorexia?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Saoirse O'Sullivan:</strong><em> There is already good clinical evidence that the plant-derived CB<sub>1</sub></em><em> agonist THC can be a useful tool for stimulating appetite and maintaining body weight in a number of diseases where wasting is a significant problem, including cancer. However, for some patients, the psychotropic and central nervous system (CNS) side effects that are associated with THC are not desired or tolerable. ART27.13 has the advantage of being peripherally restricted, meaning that it doesn’t easily cross the blood barrier and activate CB<sub>1</sub></em><em> receptors in the brain. The effect of peripheral CB<sub>1</sub></em><em> activation is also believed to promote appetite, and energy storage, and preservation, so CNS penetration is not required when treating cancer anorexia. ART27.13 is also more potent at CB<sub>1</sub></em><em> than THC and acts as a full agonist at the CB<sub>1</sub></em><em> receptor (THC is only a partial agonist). THC and its metabolites also activate another receptor called GPR119, which suppresses appetite, so weight loss can actually be observed with chronic THC use. Together, these factors make us believe that the synthetic, potent, peripherally restricted full CB<sub>1</sub></em><em> agonist ART27.13 will be more efficacious than THC for cancer anorexia.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Saoirse O'Sullivan:</strong><em> In addition to ART27.13, Artelo Biosciences has two other endocannabinoid-modulating drugs in development.&nbsp; Firstly, Artelo developed a patented novel CBD cocrystal called ART12.11. Cocrystallization is a proven pharmaceutical development strategy to address solid polymorphism and follows FDA guidance for chemicals with properties similar to CBD with poor physicochemical properties (see </em><em><a href=""http://cbdcocrystal.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cbdcocrystal.com</a></em><em>). ART12.11 uses TMP (tetramethylpyrazine) as the coformer (to form the cocrystal). TMP is a plant-derived compound that has been used in medicine and food flavoring applications for several decades. A CBD cocrystal has the potential to have better consistency, bioavailability, improved stability, and is free of any THC. ART12.11 is the first and only CBD cocrystal to have an issued composition of matter patent from the US Patent and Trademark Office.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Secondly, Artelo’s research team is also working with scientists at Stony Brook University, who are pioneers in developing fatty acid-binding protein five (FABP5) inhibitors, to advance their lipid signaling program towards first-in-human trials. At Artelo, this program is called ART26.12 and covers a library of unique small molecules that have been designed to selectively and potently inhibit FABPs.&nbsp; Preclinical studies have shown that molecules that inhibit FABP5 show considerable promise in animal models of cancer, pain, inflammation, and anxiety.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the design of the P-I/II</strong>&nbsp;<strong>CAReS study of ART27.13.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Saoirse O'Sullivan:</strong><em> CAReS is a two-stage randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with the synthetic cannabinoid, ART27.13 for cancer patients experiencing anorexia. Stage 1 of the study will determine the optimal dose of ART27.13 to be used in the second stage of the study. CAReS is recruiting adult patients of all cancers (except brain cancer or brain metastases) not on any active treatment for their cancer or on maintenance/stable anti-cancer therapy who have documented weight loss of &gt;5% body weight in the prior 6 months from enrolment. The endpoints of the trial are safety and pharmacokinetics, and measurements of lean body mass, weight gain, appetite, quality of Life (QoL), and activity. Exploratory endpoints will assess the anti-inflammatory and hormonal effects, physical activity, abuse potential, and any opioid-sparing effects of ART27.13.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When we can expect the results of this study?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Saoirse O'Sullivan:</strong><em> We are planning to be able to share data on the CAReS trial later in 2021.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you shed light for our readers on the working of ART27.13? How does it help people with Cancer Anorexia?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Saoirse O'Sullivan:</strong><em> The CB<sub>1</sub></em><em> receptor is well known to regulate appetite and body weight, however, unwanted central side effects of either agonist (in wasting disorders) or antagonists (in obesity and diabetes) have limited their use. The next generation of these potential medicines has been peripherally restricted to reduce these CNS issues. ART27.13 is a clinical development stage CB<sub>1</sub></em><em>/CB<sub>2</sub></em><em> receptor agonist with reduced brain penetration. In otherwise healthy subjects who participated in a Phase 1 pain study, it was observed that low doses of ART27.13 rapidly increased body weight of more than 3% that was not explained by fluid retention and without serious or persistent side effects.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><em>At the peripheral level, CB</em><em><sub>1</sub></em><em> receptor activation impacts the overall energy balance of mammals in a number of different ways; inhibiting satiety (feeling full) and nausea, increasing food intake, altering the levels of the hormone that controls appetite, altering taste sensation, slowing gastrointestinal motility, decreasing lipolysis (fat break down) and increasing lipogenesis (fat generation).

<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the study design of Astellas’ P-II FAST Study.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>The FAST study was a randomized, multi-center, open-label study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of zolbetuximab, an investigational anti-claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) monoclonal antibody, in combination with epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine (EOX) in first-line patients with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. The study was conducted at 49 centers across six countries (primarily Eastern Europe and Russia). Patients over the age of 18 years were eligible if they had histologically confirmed, locally advanced, inoperable, recurrent, or metastatic gastric, GEJ, and esophageal cancer that was positive for CLDN18.2 and was assigned to receive either EOX or zolbetuximab plus EOX. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with overall survival (OS) as a secondary endpoint.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the key points of PRO published in the journal <em>Gastric Cancer</em>?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from the phase 2 FAST study were analyzed to determine health-related quality of life and symptom burden related to treatment with zolbetuximab plus EOX.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why is studying the health-related quality of life important in gastric cancer?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Maintaining a good health-related quality of life and low symptom burden is essential in gastric cancer, where survival is very short, and the disease burden is high</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Highlight the data published in the journal <em>Annals of Oncology</em> and the investigational findings of the FAST study thus far.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>The data published in the Annals of Oncology highlighted PFS and OS data from the Phase 2 FAST study in patients with advanced gastric and GEJ cancer that was positive for CLDN18.2. The publication analyzed both the overall population and patients with moderate-to-strong CLDN18.2 expression in =70% of tumor cells.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Across all patients, there was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of a PFS event following treatment with zolbetuximab plus EOX versus EOX (HR=0.44; 95% CI: 0.29-0.67) and median PFS was 7.5 months with zolbetuximab plus EOX and 5.3 months with EOX alone. </em><em>In patients with moderate-to-strong CLDN18.2 expression in =70% of tumor cells, median PFS was 9 months in patients treated with zolbetuximab plus EOX and 5.7 months in patients treated with EOX. </em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Treatment with zolbetuximab plus EOX was also associated with a longer median OS and statistically significant reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.55; 95% CI, 0.39-0.77). Across all patients, the median OS was 13.0 months for the zolbetuximab plus EOX arm compared to 8.3 months with EOX alone. In the population with moderate-to-strong CLDN18.2 expression in </em><em>=70% of tumor cells group, the median OS was 16.5 months for patients treated with zolbetuximab plus EOX compared to 8.9 months with EOX alone.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The most common adverse events (AEs; =10%) that occurred more frequently in patients treated with zolbetuximab and EOX were nausea, vomiting, anemia, neutropenia, weight loss, fatigue, alopecia, asthenia, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, palmar-plantar syndrome, paresthesia, peripheral edema and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why do you think targeting the claudin pathway would be an effective way of treating GEJ and gastric adenocarcinomas?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Claudins are a family of tight junction molecules involved in the regulation of permeability, barrier function, and polarity of epithelial layers.</em><a href=""#_edn1""><em><strong>[i]</strong></em></a><em> Claudin 18.2 is a gene variant of claudin-18, whose expression is associated with tumor development and progression.<a href=""#_edn2""><strong>[ii]</strong></a> Studies have shown a significant portion of gastric tumors have a high expression of Claudin 18.2.<a href=""#_edn3""><strong>[iii]</strong></a> </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Zolbetuximab is an anti-CLDN18.2 monoclonal antibody, which is thought to bind </em><em>to Claudin 18.2 on the surface of tumor cells and is thought to induce cancer cell death through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity.<a href=""#_edn4""><strong>[iv]</strong></a></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Phase 2 study met its primary endpoint and based on clinical results observed in the overall population and patients with moderate-to-strong CLDN18.2 expression in =70% of tumor cells, Astellas is currently evaluating zolbetuximab in phase 3 studies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How this therapy is unique from the competitor therapies available in the market or the clinical phase?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>There are no head-to-head clinical trials comparing zolbetuximab to other investigational therapies. Comparisons cannot be made due to differences in trial populations and designs for each treatment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>However, we are encouraged by the Phase 2 FAST study results and look forward to evaluating the zolbetuximab through our ongoing phase 3 studies.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: When can we expect the launch of this product in the US, EU, and other geographies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Phase 3 studies surrounding zolbetuximab’s potential in CLDN18.2-positive gastric cancer are ongoing. We plan to discuss the results with relevant global health authorities once the data becomes available.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Is there anything else from this study that you would like to highlight with our readers?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Gastric cancer can be aggressive with a high mortality rate – only 6% of people whose cancer has spread to a distant part of the body will survive five years post-diagnosis – and there is a need for effective targeted therapies for patients that are HER2-negative. <a href=""#_edn5""><strong>[v]</strong></a> Astellas is committed to exploring the potential of zolbetuximab and CLDN18.2 as a predictive biomarker in these cancers and looks forward to sharing future research surrounding this investigational therapy.</em></p>

23321,PharmaShots Interview: AstraZeneca's Global Medicine Leader John Houghton Shares Insights on Roxadustat in Treating Patients with Anemia Due to CKD at ASN 2019,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AstraZeneca presented P-III data of Roxadustat along with
unprecedented 41 abstracts from its renal portfolio at American Society of
Nephrology Kidney Week 2019, demonstrating its commitment to advancing the care
of Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) and its complications, affecting millions of
people across the globe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Nov 12, 2019 in an interview with PharmaShots, John Houghton the Global Medicine Leader at AstraZeneca shares details and highlights of Roxadustat, ASN data and presented other details of the therapy along with the advancement of AstraZeneca in Nephrology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The interview with John Houghton emphasizes that Roxadustat is a drug with a unique mechanism of action inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase and is the first therapy introduced to the market with the novel mechanism. Anemia is prevalent in patients with CKD affecting 200M+ patients across the globe. AstraZeneca introduces a new treatment option for patients living with CKD, that have been waiting for three decades for new advancements. AstraZeneca, FibroGen and Astellas together evaluated Roxadustat in 9,000+ patients in P-III global program which includes OLYMPUS, ALPS and ANDES study evaluated Roxadustat vs PBO in Non-Dialysis Dependent (NDD) patients and ROCKIES, SIERRAS and HIMALAYAS evaluated Roxadustat vs Epoetin alfa in Dialysis Dependent (DD) patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you discuss the working of Roxadustat and why
this is important for CKD patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John: </strong>The unique mechanism of action, is the most
natural approach to treat anemia by mimicking the body’s natural response to
hypoxia. Roxadustat is a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor,
promoting erythropoiesis by increasing the endogenous production of
erythropoietin thus improving iron regulation and overcome the negative impact
of inflammation on hemoglobin synthesis and RBCs production by downregulating
hepcidin. Administration of Roxadustat induces coordinated erythropoiesis,
increase in RBC count while maintaining plasma erythropoietin levels within the
physiological range in Non-Dialysis dependent, Dialysis Dependent CKD patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>“Roxadustat utilizes a natural approach
to treat anemia as it mimics the body’s natural response to hypoxia by
inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor and is the
first drug in the marketplace with this unique mechanism of action”</em></strong><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can
you highlight the Roxadustat’s data at the American Society of Nephrology 2019
and the significance of its findings?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John: </strong>On the first day of ASN’19, (Nov 07, 2019) we presented
the results of P-III OLYMPUS and ROCKIES studies (the two AstraZeneca sponsored
studies, part of P-III global clinical program). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The P-III OLYMPUS study involves assessing Roxadustat vs PBO in 2,781 NDD patients in a ratio (1:1) with anemia from CKD stages 3, 4 and 5 across 26 countries. The study demonstrated improvement in Hb levels with a mean increase of 1.75g/dL vs 0.40g/dL. Roxadustat also improves Hb levels in a subgroup of patients with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), a protein found in blood increases when inflammation is present. It demonstrated mean increase of 1.73 g/dL vs 0.62g/dL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The P-III ROCKIES study assessed Roxadustat vs Epoetin alfa in 2,133 DD-CKD patients in a ratio (1:1) with anemia across 18 countries. The study demonstrated significant improvement in Hb levels with a mean increase of 0.77g/dL vs 0.68g/dL and an improvement in Hb levels in patients with elevated hsCRP levels 0.80g/dL vs 0.59g/dL. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the second day, Nov 08, 2019, we presented pooled
efficacy and CardioVascular safety results of DD-CKD and NDD-CKD patients from our
global studies in the oral late-breaking abstract session “High-Impact Clinical
Trial” at ASN.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a pooled analysis, Roxadustat showed positive efficacy
with no increase in CV risk. The pooled efficacy analyses in the NDD population
showed Roxadustat was superior to PBO, the risk of MACE, MACE+ and all-cause
mortality was comparable to PBO. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In DD patients, Roxadustat had a lower risk of MACE+ and no
increased risk of MACE or all-cause mortality compared to epoetin alfa. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Incident dialysis (ID) patients, defined as patients who have been on dialysis for =4mos., Roxadustat had a lower risk of MACE &amp; MACE+ and showed a trend towards a lower risk of all-cause mortality relative to epoetin alfa.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, we presented a strong result of Roxadustat at ASN
2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: In
what way Roxadustat is different from other Anti-Anemic drugs. As Takeda has recalled
its product Omontys (Peginesatide) due to hypersensitivity reactions. Are there
any such complications with Roxadustat?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John: </strong>Takeda’s Omontys (peginesatide) has a different mechanism of action to Roxadust, so I can’t comment on why &amp; why not it happened to Takeda’s Omontys, all I can comment on Roxadustat is based on the novel mechanism as it promotes erythropoiesis by inhibiting HIF-PHI as earlier discussed. We have good safety and efficacy results which we can use for approval. We have not seen any hypersensitivity reactions during the trials but there always patients that could be hypersensitive to any product or even PBO but there is no sign of any hypersensitivity reactions with Roxadustat till date.<em> </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What
is the timeframe in which AstraZeneca is going to work with the Regulatory Agency
of India for Roxadustat?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John: </strong>We have already connected with the Indian
regulatory agencies, not only about the US program but also for the China
program. We plan to submit a regulatory filing in the US which is anticipated
in the year-end 2019. After this, we will switch to regulatory submission in
other countries across the globe including India. The pleasing thing we have
300+ patients in the program for India so we met the requirement to a significant
number of patients and Indian authorities are pleased with it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How
many patients worldwide are impacted by chronic kidney disease and its
complications, like Anemia?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John: </strong>There are approximately 200+M patients worldwide affected with CKD and about 40M patients are suffering in the US, half of the million patients across the EU, China is dialysis-dependent and 98% of patients are also anemic. 4M patients in NDD are in stage 4&amp;3 CKD requiring anemia treatment. Most patients undergoing dialysis are treated for anemia and less to non-dialysis patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope with our efficacy and safety data, we can impress the
US FDA to approve our drug in the US. Facts leading to kidney diseases are
diabetes, obesity, hypertension. Unfortunately, these diseases are epidemic
across the globe and if these increases, there is an automatic increase in
kidney disease. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How
will Roxadustat potentially change the way patients are treated?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John: </strong>DD
patients are going for dialysis in clinics and receiving therapies three times
a week and in NDD patients, the only competition is other therapies are
formulated as injectable while Roxadustat is an oral preparation so Roxadustat
is more compatible to the patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, we are providing efficacy in all populations whether DD, NDD or patients with inflammation and we have no cardiovascular risks. So, I can say that Roxadustat will become a nephrologist choice when it comes to treating all kinds of patients suffering from anemia. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>“Roxadustat will become a nephrologist
choice when it comes to treating all kind of patients suffering from anemia”</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why AstraZeneca is so committed to helping to advance the care of chronic kidney diseases<a> </a>and its complications for patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John: </strong>There has been no innovation in the treatment of chronic kidney disease from the last 30yrs. So, we feel there is a big opportunity to help patients across the globe by introducing Roxadustat in the market to meet the unmet medical needs of CKD patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally,
we have Lokelma (sodium
zirconium cyclosilicate) for hyperkalemia, which is again a big problem in
renal patients, Farxiga (dapagliflozin) for the prevention of chronic kidney
disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have recognized this as an opportunity for us to take up innovative science and providing therapies for treating CKD. We are involved in a lot of research regarding renal disease to help patients suffering from chronic kidney disease.  </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil</strong><em>:&nbsp; Pooled data from the AURA-LV and AURORA 1 study demonstrate that LUPKYNIS, in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and low-dose corticosteroids, led to treatment benefits across biopsy class subgroups compared with treatment with MMF and low-dose corticosteroids alone (placebo). MMF and low-dose corticosteroids are considered standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of LN.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; What is the impact of the data on the potential treatment of LN?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil</strong><em>:&nbsp;&nbsp; The new data analysis from the AURORA and AURA clinical studies show that LUPKYNIS demonstrated efficacy across all LN biopsy classes, which is important because people with LN often experience delays in diagnosis, which may cause them to progress in disease severity. This data shows that treatment with Aurinia’s therapy can help people achieve reductions in proteinuria (protein in the urine) regardless of disease stage</em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Tell us more about Lupus Nephritis. Discuss the symptoms, treatments, and complications related to the disease.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil</strong><em>:  Lupus nephritis (LN) is an inflammation of the kidneys that represents one of the most serious complications of the chronic autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In LN, inflammation leads to tissue damage and protein in the urine (proteinuria). If left untreated, LN can lead to irreversible kidney damage, kidney failure, or even death. Approximately 45% of people with SLE develop LN at some point in their lifetime, and approximately a third have LN when they are diagnosed with SLE. There are approximately 500,000 people with SLE in the United States, making people with LN a significant subset of the total SLE population.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In patients with lupus nephritis, kidney damage may start prior to the first clinically detected episode of lupus nephritis. Kidney biopsy is the standard for confirming lupus nephritis diagnosis, and a kidney biopsy delay longer than six months is associated with 9 times greater risk of progression to kidney failure. A person whose kidney degenerates to the point of kidney failure has a risk of premature death more than 60 times higher than normal. Therefore, patients should be actively and routinely screened for signs of the disease, and if diagnosed, immediately managed.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Patients with lupus nephritis who achieve a complete response as measured by decreases in proteinuria (protein in the urine) and a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) of less than 0.5 mg/mg can achieve better long term kidney outcomes such as avoidance of kidney failure, dialysis or need for transplantation which all have a severe impact on a person’s health and quality of life, in addition to incurring significant healthcare system costs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Share the history behind your lead candidate, Lupkynis?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil:</strong><em> Aurinia has translated decades of research to develop and launch LUPKYNIS (voclosporin).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>2014 marked the enrollment of the first patient in AURA-LV to evaluate the efficacy of voclosporin as a treatment for LN. The following year, Aurinia initiated an open-label, exploratory study to assess the short-term predictors of response using voclosporin in patients. By 2017, the Phase 3 AURORA clinical trial was underway and positive trial results were announced in December 2019 allowing for FDA submission in May of 2020. Priority review was designated in August 2020 and FDA approval granted in January 2021. Since then, LUPKYNIS represents the first FDA-approved oral therapy for active LN, with the potential to provide improved outcomes for a population with significant unmet treatment needs.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: What motivates the company to work on autoimmune diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Neil: </strong><em>Autoimmune diseases are some of the most challenging and burdensome chronic diseases for global healthcare systems and on an individual level as they often have significant impacts on quality of life. Through scientific and clinical excellence, deep engagement with patient communities, and commercial expertise, Aurinia is committed to leadership in autoimmune disease to deliver long-term value to patients and the healthcare system.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tony: </strong>&nbsp;<em>The BD Veritor Plus System is a portable, rapid and easy-to-use point-of-care antigen test that detects SARS-CoV-2 – the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 – with results provided in just 15 minutes on a simple, digital display. It has received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SARS-CoV-2 screening through the serial testing of asymptomatic individuals, which enables its use in various settings, including everything from schools to sports. For example, USA Track &amp; Field (USATF) is using rapid COVID-19 testing </em><em>with the BD Veritor Plus System** to help get athletes back on the track safely, as well as their coaches, event organizers and other personnel. S</em><em>pecifically, as the official COVID-19 testing partner of USATF, tests using the BD Veritor Plus System were conducted at multiple events throughout the Journey to Gold – Tokyo Outdoor Track &amp; Field Series and are also being used throughout the U.S. Olympic Team Trials</em><em> – Track &amp; Field.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the importance of your BD alliance with USATF.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tony<em>: </em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>BD’s partnership with USATF is part of the company’s commitment to helping get people back to their normal lives. Ensuring people have a fast and reliable way to determine their COVID-19 status has been and will continue to be critical in slowing the spread of the virus</em>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Why is there a need for rapid COVID-19 testing of USATF athletes?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tony: </strong>&nbsp;<em>The US Olympic Team Trials bring together large groups of people – including the athletes who have been working and training for this enormous opportunity. They’ve already postponed their dreams for a year. Our partnership supports the USATF organization’s effort to hold these important competitions safely for all involved. The testing protocol allows the athletes in particular focus on their performance with the peace of mind that their health and safety are being protected.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the importance of rapid testing of SARS-CoV-2 in combatting the pandemic.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tony: </strong>&nbsp;<em>There are a number of reasons why rapid antigen testing is an important tool in fighting the spread of the virus. It’s fast, easy and reliable. Even people who are not skilled laboratory technicians can successfully use a rapid test system like the BD Veritor Plus System, which is a fully portable device with a simple testing process and results that come back in as little as 15 minutes via a digital readout. Rapid antigen testing is also less expensive than lab-based PCR tests, while delivering a combination of simplicity, speed, portability, and reliable results. That makes it an ideal choice for use for non-healthcare settings in particular, like the USATF events, schools, entertainment venues and more.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are BD’s other efforts for the effective testing of COVID-19?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tony<em>: </em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>In addition to helping these athletes get safely back to competition, the BD Veritor Plus System is helping the public get back on track with their normal lives through its widespread use in other settings like schools and entertainment venues. Also of note, the FDA has granted us an EUA for a new, rapid antigen test that uses the BD Veritor™ Plus System to detect SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B in a single test, which may prove to be particularly helpful this winter when flu cases are expected to rise. In addition to providing antigen- and molecular-based diagnostics, BD has also been on the forefront of the COVID-19 response by providing injection devices for vaccine administration, innovative solutions for immunology research and devices that aid in therapeutics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Why does USATF consider BD an ideal partner for testing the athletes?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tony: </strong>&nbsp;<em>BD has been long known and trusted for our expertise in diagnostic testing. That expertise and the quality of our BD Veritor Plus System helped give USATF confidence that we are the right partner to help protect the health and safety of its professional athletes, their coaches, event organizers and other personnel throughout the U.S. Olympic Trials. We’re proud to be partnering with them to support these world-class athletes as they compete to achieve their dreams.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Is the BD Veritor Plus System fully FDA approved for use in the U.S.?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tony: </strong>&nbsp;<em>BD Veritor has been a trusted brand for nearly a decade. The BD Veritor System received its first clearance from the FDA in 2011 for its use in the rapid detection of Flu A+B. The FDA then provided subsequent approvals for its use in the detection of Respiratory Synctial Virus (RSV) and Group A Strep.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Early on in the pandemic, we began exploring its potential use in the development of a point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2, confident that our long-term expertise in this area could help develop a COVID-19 test and give us a critically important tool in the fight against the virus. On July 6, 2020, the FDA granted an EUA for our rapid, point-of-care, diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 using the BD Veritor Plus System in health care settings.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Then, on March 30, 2021, the FDA granted us another EUA for a new, rapid antigen test using the BD Veritor Plus System that can detect SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B in a single test. And most recently, on</em> <em>April 1, 2021, the FDA amended the EUA for our BD Veritor Plus System to be used for SARS-CoV-2 screening through serial testing of asymptomatic individuals.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you open to more collaboration for the betterment of athletes?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tony: </strong>&nbsp;<em>BD recently announced that it is also the official COVID-19 testing partner of USA Swimming. Tests using the BD Veritor Plus System will be conducted at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials – Swimming to enhance the safety of athletes seeking to qualify for the Tokyo games, as well as other 2021-2022 USA Swimming events where testing is required.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Highlights the key features of data presented at ASCO by BeyondSpring.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Mohanlal:</strong> <em>&nbsp;The study results being presented at this year's ASCO conference related to the poster titled, “A Phase I Trial of Plinabulin in Combination with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Patients with Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC),” describes an investigator-initiated Phase 1 study where plinabulin was combined with nivolumab and ipilimumab in the treatment of 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;and 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;line small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in a total of 16 patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>It highlights preliminary data demonstrating potent and potentiating anti-cancer effects of the combination of plinabulin, nivolumab, and ipilimumab, with an overall 46% objective response rate (ORR) in 13 evaluable patients with PD-1/PD-L1 naïve or resistant tumors in 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;and 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;line SCLC. The nivolumab/ipilimumab IO combination was recently withdrawn from the market, due to lack of efficacy in a trial designed to confirm its efficacy in SCLC. By adding plinabulin to nivolumab/ipilimumab, we observed a highly impactful improvement in anticancer efficacy that was not seen before with the nivolumab and ipilimumab alone. We demonstrated this impactful benefit with plinabulin in a small Phase 1 trial, and seek to confirm this in a larger Phase 2 trial that already has been initiated.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Early-efficacy data included that the ORR was 50% for the six patients receiving the triple IO combination as second-line therapy after platinum. Three patients had partial responses (PR), with the best tumor reduction at target lesions of 100%, 53%, and 45%, respectively. Also, the ORR was 43% for the seven patients receiving the triple IO combination as third-line therapy, who had either failed or had not responded to platinum and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Three patients had PRs, with the best tumor reductions at target lesions of 78%, 75%, and 52%, respectively. The duration of therapy for these three PR patients was 18 months, five months (still on treatment), and three months, respectively.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>An additional endpoint of the trial was to evaluate whether the addition of plinabulin to nivolumab + ipilimumab would reduce Immune-Related Adverse Events (IR-AEs). IR-AEs are inflammatory responses caused by overstimulation of the immune system. The principle of IO treatment is to stimulate the immune system, which at times may cause overstimulation of the immune system. IR-AEs are the most predominant limitations to immunotherapy, and if it reaches Grade 3 or 4, it leads to permanent discontinuation of these IO agents. This not only represents a loss of effective treatment options to the patient but also a loss of revenues to BMS, the manufacturer of these agents. Plinabulin potentially has the ability to reduce IR-AEs, because it inhibits an inflammation-pathway called PDE4. It is very gratifying to see that the Grade 3/4 IR-AE frequency in the study with plinabulin + nivolumab + ipilimumab was 12.5%,</em> <em>whereas with nivolumab + ipilimumab alone was reported to be 37% with nivolumab + ipilimumab alone. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;</strong><strong>Discuss the impact of plinabulin on patients with SCLC.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Mohanlal:</strong> <em>&nbsp;SCLC continues to represent an area of unmet medical need. By adding plinabulin to nivolumab + ipilimumab, we enhance both antigen generation and antigen presentation to the T-cell repertoire, resulting in an expected superior anticancer efficacy compared to nivolumab + ipilimumab, which as we now know was shown to be ineffective. The preliminary observation that Plinabulin also decreases IR-AEs caused by the nivolumab + ipilimumab combination represents collectively a very powerful product offering with adding plinabulin to a PD1/PD-L1+CTLA4 combination. To offer patients the promise of living longer at reduced toxicity is our common holy grail. If this comes with an increased return to the pharmaceutical industry represents a win-win scenario for all parties involved. &nbsp;We consider this trial in SCLC &nbsp;as a proof-of-concept study, and if it will work here, this concept will work in many other cancer types. &nbsp;We look forward to reporting the data from Phase 2, which just started, in a larger number of patients.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Tuba:  <em>“</em>Plinabulin is a potent agent to mature and activate dendritic cells.” Shed some light on this statement.</strong><br><br><strong>Dr. Mohanlal:</strong> <em> Through a number of independent studies we demonstrated that the principal mechanism by which Plinabulin exerts its anticancer effect, is though enabling dendritic cells to better activate helper and cytotoxic T-cells, which latter can be viewed as the foot soldiers that go out and kill cancer cells in an antigen-specific manner. Two seminal peer-reviewed publications from 2019 helped shed light on the unique mechanisms of action of plinabulin, including its effects on the </em>maturation and activation of dendritic cells. The first, La Sala et al., 2019 Chem, highlights tubulin-binding properties of plinabulin which act<em> as a precursor to activation of GEF-H1. The second publication, <a href=""https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdfExtended/S2211-1247(19)31105-2"">Kashyap et al., 2019 Cell Reports</a>, highlights the required link between GEF-H1 signaling and the dendritic cell activation and maturation that is specific to antigen cross-presentation, T cell activation as well as anti-tumor activity. A <a href=""https://beyondspringpharma.com/new-preclinical-data-demonstrates-immune-enhancing-effects-of-triple-i-o-combination-therapy-with-beyondsprings-plinabulin/"">third study from the 2020 AACR conference</a> demonstrated that plinabulin leads to activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells and that combinations with anti-PD-1 and radiation therapies showed further activation of the immune system, in preclinical cancer models.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additional MOA publications resulting from a multi-year collaboration with the University of Basel, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Mass General Hospital further elucidated plinabulin's mechanisms which also include 1) delaying neutrophil cell death to complement the actions of granulocyte cell-stimulating factor treatments like pegfilgrastim (supporting the recent NDA acceptance by the U.S. FDA for plinabulin in combination with pegfilgrastim for prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia) and 2) Direct cancer cell killing effects through JNK activation.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><strong>Dr. Mohanlal:</strong> <em>&nbsp;Simply put, we consider plinabulin as an agent to agent that exerts a broad defense strategy to insults attacking the host (the patient), which insult includes cancer cells. Plinabulin is a selective immunomodulating microtubule-binding agent (SIMBA), a first-in-class small drug treatment with multiple mechanisms of action supporting its broad “pipeline in a product” potential as a treatment that can help prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (in combination with pegfilgrastim), as well as having a potential direct anti-cancer activity (being tested in the ongoing Phase 3 DUBLIN-3 study of plinabulin in non-small cell lung cancer, which is expected to produce topline data in mid-2021) and immuno-oncology activity, as validated in the current posted being presented at ASCO 2021. Further details about plinabulin's mechanism of action are mentioned in the answer to Question 4.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How has BeyondSpring made tremendous growth in the field of oncology?</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Mohanlal:</strong> <em>&nbsp;Immuno-oncology therapy has demonstrated its worth as the biggest advancement in oncology in the last decades. While acknowledging the impact that IO therapy made in oncology, it is equally fair to point out that the current IO strategies work but are not the Silver bullet. Much more work needs to be done to bring out the full potential of current IO treatment, and that is where plinabulin comes in. With the SCLC data, we demonstrated that adding plinabulin to IO makes nivolumab + plinabulin work better as anticancer agents, and also improves their safety by reducing IR-AEs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>BeyondSpring’s strategy is in general, not to go where ‘everyone</em> is going, but important<em> to look at future trends and at limitations of current IO approaches and to complement and improve on those trends.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;When you are expecting the first approval for plinabulin?</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Mohanlal: &nbsp;</strong>On June 1, we announced that the FDA had accepted, for Priority Review, the NDA for plinabulin in combination with pegfilgrastim for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date for November 30, 2021. Neutrophils are our first line of Innate Immunity defense to foreign insults such as bacteria and fungi. CIN is an indication that<em> hasn’t had an approved drug in over 30 years. A matching NDA is also under review with the China NMPA. We are focused on working with regulators on these submissions and, if all goes well, hope to announce approvals before the end of 2021.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you open to collaborations for the commercialization of plinabulin?</strong><br><br><strong>Dr. Mohanlal:</strong> <em>&nbsp;Yes, we are open to collaborations for commercialization and/or co-development in all regions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;</strong><strong>Can you provide a glimpse of your robust pipeline?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Mohanlal:</strong> <em>&nbsp;As indicated before, BeyondSpring’s strategy is to carefully analyze and address the future trends in the IO space, with the aim not to compete with current approaches, but to make current approaches better, in terms of both efficacy and safety. In addition to CIN and SCLC, plinabulin is in a Phase 3 trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the DUBLIN-3 trial, with topline data expected in mid-2021. This means that in addition to the Phase 1 IO activity presented at ASCO and the NDAs being reviewed for prevention of CIN, there's a chance that plinabulin also shows direct anti-cancer activity in NSCLC. We are also advancing a pipeline </em>with a novel new Phase 1 trial, that we cannot disclose at this time, and with developing a novel <em>targeted protein degradation platform&nbsp;(TPD) class of therapies with our subsidiary Seed Therapeutics&nbsp;which is developing&nbsp;novel agents for undruggable targets. This technology was&nbsp;partially validated by&nbsp;our $800M&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;deal&nbsp;that we received last year&nbsp;with&nbsp;Lilly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Tell us more about Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica: &nbsp;</strong><em>Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common type of multiple sclerosis (MS), accounting for approximately 85 percent of diagnoses.<sup>1</sup></em><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We continue to learn more about how the heterogeneous nature of MS and health inequities affect different populations. For example, we know that Hispanic Americans with MS are younger at age of onset and diagnosis, with higher levels of cognitive and manual dexterity impairment when compared to their white non-Hispanic counterparts. Additionally, twice as many Black people with MS have substantial MS-related disability compared to white patients.<sup>2,3</sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><em>People who have RRMS have relapses of new or worsening neurological symptoms with periods of remission occurring in between.<sup>1</sup> MS is a heterogeneous disease and each patient’s journey and symptoms can vary greatly. Biogen has a broad portfolio of MS therapies designed to address the different needs of patients</em>.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we discuss more about the mechanism of action for Plegridy and how it works on MS patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> <em>PLEGRIDY (peginterferon beta-1a) is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. PLEGRIDY is the only pegylated beta interferon approved for use in relapsing or relapsing-remitting MS and is dosed once every two weeks.&nbsp;Although there is a large body of evidence on how interferon beta’s impact the immune system, the exact mechanism by which PLEGRIDY exerts its effects in patients with multiple sclerosis is unknown.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>PLEGRIDY builds on our experience with interferons which dates back to the 1990s when we launched AVONEX (interferon beta-1a) in 1996 as a once-a-week injection. We then continued our work in MS and introduced PLEGRIDY which through the process of pegylation enables it to be dosed every two weeks.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Why there is a need to develop IM injection if Biogen already had SC formulation for Plegridy? Does this improve patient adherence or efficacy/ safety?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica:</strong>  <em>As a leader in MS, Biogen is constantly innovating across its robust MS portfolio to help address the individual needs of the community.  Part of that innovation involves providing more treatment choices, including new routes of administration.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Biogen developed an intramuscular (IM) administration of PLEGRIDY based on feedback from MS physicians, who expressed the desire for an IM route of administration in addition to the subcutaneous <em>(SC)</em></em> <em>administration to provide a choice for their patients. Injection site reactions may occur with the subcutaneous administration of PLEGRIDY. The availability of a new IM route of administration offers individuals living with relapsing or relapsing-remitting MS an additional choice combining the safety and efficacy of PLEGRIDY, with the potential to significantly reduce injection site reactions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we discuss more about the clinical studies which lead to the approval of Plegridy in the EU and U.S.?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica:</strong>  <em>PLEGRIDY was first approved in the EU and U.S. in 2014, based on results from one of the largest pivotal studies of beta interferon conducted, ADVANCE, which involved more than 1,500 patients with relapsing-remitting MS.2 PLEGRIDY has been shown to significantly reduce important measures of relapsing MS disease activity and has a well-characterized safety and efficacy profile. Some side effects observed in these trials include liver problems, depression, and injection site reactions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The recent approvals of PLEGRIDY for IM administration by the European Commission (EC) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are based on data demonstrating bioequivalence with the SC administration and overall similar safety profiles in healthy volunteers.<sup>3</sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can you throw some light on the clinical studies their design and how these trials were instrumental in approval?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica:</strong> <em>The approvals of PLEGRIDY for IM administration were based on data evaluating bioequivalence and adverse reactions associated with IM administration compared to SC administration in healthy volunteers. Bioequivalence between the two routes of administration was confirmed and data show that participants receiving PLEGRIDY through IM administration experienced fewer injection site reactions in comparison to participants receiving SC administration (14.4 percent vs. 32.1 percent). The overall safety profiles were similar and there were no new safety signals observed.<sup>4</sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;When can we expect the launch of Plegridy IM formulation in the EU?&nbsp; Where do you plan to launch Plegridy in EU? When will it be available in the U.S.?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica: </strong><em>The IM route of administration of PLEGRIDY has already launched in Germany, the UK, Ireland, and the U.S.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Biogen is actively working to launch the IM route of administration of PLEGRIDY in countries throughout the EU and in the U.S.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>PLEGRIDY is currently approved in over 60 countries including the U.S., Canada, Australia and Switzerland, and across the European Union. Over 61,000 people worldwide have been treated with PLEGRIDY,&nbsp;with over&nbsp;120,000&nbsp;patient years of experience, based on prescription data.<sup>5</sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you planning to explore other geographies except Europe and the US?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica: </strong><em>Biogen plans to file in other countries around the world.</em><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Is Biogen planning to assess Plegridy in other indications beyond MS?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica: </strong><em>There are no current plans to assess PLEGRIDY in indications outside of relapsing-remitting MS.</em><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we discuss on any patient support programs Biogen plans to launch in EU? Can you discuss little about already running programs in the US or other geographies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica:</strong>  <em>The launch of the IM route of administration of PLEGRIDY will include the adaptation of existing AVONEX and PLEGRIDY Patient Support Programs in the EU, including digital patient materials and video tools to help facilitate education about this new route of administration.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the U.S., Biogen Support Services offers financial assistance, help with navigating insurance, and additional information on treatment.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Is Biogen planning to launch any digital initiatives to increase patient adherence or for HCP educations?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monica:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As part of Biogen’s ongoing commitment to members of the MS community, we’ve developed digital tools and resources to help patients and caregivers manage the demands of daily life. O</em><em>ne of these offerings is Biogen’s Cleo app (called “Aby” in the U.S.), which empowers people with MS to access news and information from the comfort of their home, with options to journal and track symptoms, explore exercise programs, practice guided meditation or chat live with a nurse.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition, new innovative tools using smart devices are designed to support the patient-physician relationship CogEval is a free, easy-to-use iPad app developed by Biogen that is designed to help HCP’s routinely evaluate cognitive function in people with MS. Based on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), CogEval provides a two-minute assessment of attention, psychomotor speed, visual processing, and working memory, and is completed by patients in a healthcare office setting. CogEval is available in 39 countries and 22 languages.<sup>6</sup></em></p>

<p><strong>Wildon</strong>: <em>People with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons that support sitting, walking and the basic functions of life, including breathing and swallowing. Once motor neurons are lost, they cannot be replaced.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The RESPOND study&nbsp;seeks to&nbsp;understand if the proven efficacy of SPINRAZA and its continuous production of SMN protein may also benefit patients&nbsp;previously&nbsp;treated with gene therapy who have had a suboptimal clinical response.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In clinical practice, there is a sense of urgency to address motor neuron loss in SMA from the earliest sign of symptoms, or even prior to symptoms, to prevent additional disease progression.&nbsp;</em><em>As&nbsp;we continue to pursue improved outcomes for children with SMA, the need for additional benefit in&nbsp;some&nbsp;patients treated with the gene therapy Zolgensma&nbsp;has been observed.&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>It has been reported&nbsp;that&nbsp;to-date,&nbsp;four&nbsp;out&nbsp;of 10&nbsp;patients in the long-term study of Zolgensma&nbsp;have&nbsp;subsequently been&nbsp;treated&nbsp;with SPINRAZA, in addition to real-world experience&nbsp;with SPINRAZA treatment following Zolgensma.<sup>2-5</sup>&nbsp;We believe that, for certain SMA patients,&nbsp;motor neurons may be insufficiently treated by this gene therapy.&nbsp;Preclinical data also show that not all motor neurons are&nbsp;transduced&nbsp;by gene therapy,&nbsp;leaving&nbsp;some&nbsp;untreated.<sup>6,7</sup>&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The RESPOND study will enroll children who are determined by the investigator to have the potential for additional clinical improvement after receiving Zolgensma. Physicians will use criteria that may include one or more of the following: suboptimal motor function (e.g., a score lower than 50 on the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders [CHOP INTEND]); the need for respiratory support; abnormal swallowing or feeding ability; or other factors deemed relevant by the investigator.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We expect that the RESPOND study will generate valuable data&nbsp;to&nbsp;help inform future treatment decisions for&nbsp;our&nbsp;youngest SMA patients and their families.&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> &nbsp;<strong>What are the Primary and Secondary outcomes in the two year RESPOND study?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wildon</strong>: <em>The primary endpoint is the total score on the&nbsp;Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Section 2 (HINE-2).&nbsp;Secondary endpoints include safety, change from baseline on additional motor function measures, other clinical outcomes&nbsp;(e.g., swallowing) and caregiver burden. Neurofilament levels, an exploratory endpoint, will also be evaluated as a marker of biological disease activity.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> &nbsp;<strong>Can we have a glance at the epidemiology of SMA? How is it affecting the lives of infants and adults?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wildon</strong>: <em>SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disorder. It is characterized by a loss of motor neurons that results in progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. The disease impacts individuals of all ages, from infants and children to teens and adults, with a spectrum of disease severity.&nbsp;The incidence of SMA is estimated to be approximately&nbsp;one&nbsp;in 10,000 people&nbsp;and is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the leading genetic causes&nbsp;of infant mortality.<sup>8</sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Traditionally, SMA has been divided into four primary types based on when symptoms&nbsp;begin&nbsp;and the highest motor milestones achieved.&nbsp;The clinical course of SMA is highly variable; however, progressive muscle weakness, motor function impairment and disability affect all individuals with SMA regardless of disease type. Without treatment, the majority of children born with the most severe form of the disease usually die before they turn 2 years of age without nutritional and respiratory support.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Until just a few years ago, no disease modifying treatments existed for SMA. Fortunately, there are three approved treatments now available – with SPINRAZA being the first treatment approved in 2016 – offering different dosing and administration options. These medicines have demonstrated unprecedented survival and improvement in motor function in patients with SMA.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wildon</strong>: <em>SPINRAZA is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to target a root cause of SMA by increasing the amount of full-length SMN protein, which is critical to maintaining motor neurons. ASOs are short, synthetic strings of nucleotides designed to selectively bind to target RNA.&nbsp;SPINRAZA’s unique mechanism of action activates continuous SMN protein production where the disease starts within the CNS.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> &nbsp;<strong>Being the company’s focus, what will be your next step in meeting the demands of patients with neuro disorders?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wildon</strong>: <em>There is still no cure for SMA, and unmet needs remain for many people living with the disease. At Biogen, we are committed to furthering research to expand the understanding of SMA and&nbsp;find new treatment options to help improve patients’ lives</em><em>?</em><em>. W</em><em>e continue to&nbsp;explore the potential of SPINRAZA based on its established profile, including the safety and efficacy of a higher dose than currently approved. We are also pursuing&nbsp;next-generation gene therapy technologies for SMA.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our research into neurofilaments as potential biomarkers may also aid in developing a more personalized approach for SMA treatment. Neurofilaments are released into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood following the breakdown or degradation of neurons caused by SMA or other neurodegenerative disorders. While further research is needed to understand their role as a biomarker, neurofilament levels could help provide additional information to understand SMA disease activity and monitor treatment response.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As pioneers in neuroscience, Biogen is committed to developing innovative medicines for individuals afflicted with diseases such as SMA, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,&nbsp;</em><em>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&nbsp;and multiple sclerosis, which may have limited or no available treatment options. These are complex areas that require extensive research,&nbsp;as well as taking on significant scientific and financial risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> &nbsp;<strong>Discuss the clinical data that supports the efficacy of Spinraza in people with early and later-onset SMA.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wildon</strong>: <em>The clinical development program for SPINRAZA has evaluated more than 300 patients in 10 trials. Some patients have been on therapy for more than seven years as participants in our ongoing long-term extension study, SHINE. In addition to the clinical data, there is extensive real-world experience with SPINRAZA across ages with more than 11,000 patients having been treated worldwide.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>SPINRAZA was approved based on results from the randomized, sham-controlled, pivotal&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1702752"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">ENDEAR</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1710504"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">CHERISH</a>&nbsp;trials in patients with infantile-onset and later-onset SMA, respectively. These two pivotal trials are supported by additional studies across a broad range of SMA types and levels of function.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The efficacy of SPINRAZA for symptomatic infants was demonstrated in ENDEAR, with 51 percent of infants receiving SPINRAZA (n=73) considered motor milestone-responders compared to 0 percent of untreated infants (n=37). Those treated with SPINRAZA also saw a 47 percent reduction in the risk of death or use of permanent-assisted ventilation.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;In CHERISH, 57 percent of the children with later-onset SMA achieved a significant improvement in motor function due to SPINRAZA treatment (n=84).<sup>10</sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Perhaps the best window into the impact of SPINRAZA is the ongoing&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nmd-journal.com/article/S0960-8966(19)31127-7/fulltext#%20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">NURTURE</a>&nbsp;study (n=25).<sup>11&nbsp;</sup>The study is evaluating the benefits of early and continuous treatment with SPINRAZA in pre-symptomatic infants who were genetically diagnosed with SMA shortly after birth before they showed any signs of the disease.&nbsp;<a href=""https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-results-landmark-nurture-study-show-pre-symptomatic-sma"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Results presented in 2020</a>&nbsp;suggest most children in the study&nbsp;achieved motor milestones within a normal timeframe, compared to the natural course of the disease. All study participants are alive after nearly five years, and they continue to make and maintain progressive gains in motor function. Ninety-six percent were walking with assistance at their last follow-up visit. The NURTURE study has been extended for an additional three years and will evaluate the longer-term efficacy and safety of SPINRAZA through 8 years of age.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition, two independent, real-world studies were published in 2020 that add to the growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of SPINRAZA in adults:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Data from the largest supportive study of SPINRAZA to date, an open-label study including 139 adults with later-onset SMA (Types 2 and 3), was published in&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(20)30037-5/fulltext?rss=yes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">The&nbsp;Lancet&nbsp;Neurology</a>.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Results show a statistically significant improvement in mean&nbsp;Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE)&nbsp;scores from baseline of 1.73 points at 6 months (n=124), 2.58 at 10 months (n=92), and 3.12 (n=57). Additionally, the percent of patients with a clinically meaningful change from baseline (as defined by =3 point improvement) were 28 percent, 35 percent, and 40 percent at months 6, 10, and 14 respectively.

This study of 116 SPINRAZA-treated&nbsp;patients includes the largest cohort of adult patients with SMA Type 3 investigated to date in a real-world setting (n=103) plus a smaller number of SMA Type 2 patients (n=13). Taken together, after 14 months of SPINRAZA treatment, 69 percent of adults showed clinically meaningful improvements in the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), HFMSE and/or the 6 Minute Walk Test.</em><em></em></li><li><em>Note: The main limitation of these studies was the absence of a control group and the observational design, two factors which can limit the extent to which study outcomes can be attributed to treatment rather than other factors.

<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Rich Colvin, M.D., Ph.D., Interim Chief Medical Officer at bluebird bio</strong> shares his views on the Skysona and its working on CALD patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>If granted marketing authorization, Skysona would be the first approved one-time gene therapy for CALD which is a rare neurogenerative disease with typically childhood onset</li><li>The CHMP opinion is supported by data from the Starbeam trial, which showed that Skysona was safe, efficacious, and durable in treating CALD in most patients</li><li>The EMA has previously accepted Skysona into its Priorities Medicines scheme (PRIME) and granted it Orphan Medicinal Product designation, recognizing the importance of a new treatment option for the severe unmet need in the patient population</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can you share information about the epidemiology, prevalence, and incidence of ALD and CALD?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rich Colvin</strong>: <em>Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare, X-linked metabolic disorder that primarily affects males; worldwide, an estimated one in 21,000 male newborns are diagnosed with ALD. The disorder is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene that affect the production of adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) and subsequently cause toxic accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), primarily in the adrenal gland and white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Approximately 40% of boys with ALD will develop CALD, the most severe form of ALD. CALD is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease that involves the breakdown of myelin, the protective sheath of the nerve cells in the brain responsible for thinking and muscle control. The onset of symptoms of CALD typically occurs in childhood (median age 7).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is SKYSONA and how does it work?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rich Colvin</strong>: <em>SKYSONA is a one-time investigational gene therapy that uses ex vivo transduction with the Lenti-D lentiviral vector (LVV) to add functional copies of the&nbsp;ABCD1&nbsp;gene into a patient’s own hematopoietic (blood) stem cells (HSCs). The addition of the functional&nbsp;ABCD1&nbsp;gene allows patients to produce the ALD protein, which is thought to facilitate the breakdown of VLCFAs. The goal of treatment with SKYSONA is to stabilize the progression of CALD and, consequently, preserve as much neurological function as possible, including the preservation of motor function and communication ability. Importantly, with SKYSONA, there is no need for donor HSCs from another person.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:  Can we discuss the trial design and key features of the Starbeam (Ph2/3) Study?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rich Colvin</strong>: <em>The ongoing, pivotal Phase 2/3 Starbeam study (ALD-102) treated&nbsp;32 patients with a median follow-up time of 38.6 months (13.4 – 82.7 months), as of the last data set reported at the EBMT 2021 virtual congress. Of the 32 patients who have received eli-cel in ALD-102, 27 have completed the study and enrolled in a long-term follow-up study (LTF-304). Two additional patients continue to be followed in ALD-102 and have not reached 24 months post-treatment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The primary efficacy endpoint in the study is the proportion of patients who are alive and free of MFDs at Month 24. Of those patients who have reached Month 24, 90% (n=27/30) have met the primary endpoint and continue to be alive and MFD-free at two years of follow-up. There is no evidence of MFDs through nearly seven years (up to 82.7 months) of follow-up in the 27 patients who completed ALD-102. Fourteen patients in LTF-304 have reached at least their Year 5 follow-up visit, including seven patients who have reached at least their Year 6 follow-up visit. The two patients from ALD-102 that have not reached Month 24 have also shown no evidence of MFDs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As previously reported, two patients withdrew from the study at the investigator's discretion, and one experienced rapid disease progression early on in the study, resulting in MFDs and subsequent death.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In ALD-102, 26/28 evaluable patients maintained a neurologic function score (NFS) less than or equal to 1 through Month 24, and 24 of those patients had no change in their NFS, which showed maintenance of neurological function in the majority of patients. All patients who completed ALD-102</em> <em>enrolled for long-term follow-up in the LTF-304 study. The median duration of follow-up was 38.59 months (min.: 13.4; max.: 82.7).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The treatment regimen, comprising mobilization/apheresis, conditioning, and SKYSONA infusion, had a safety/tolerability profile primarily reflective of the known effects of mobilization/apheresis and conditioning.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;When can we expect the availability of SKYSONA in the market as it will be the first approved one-time gene therapy for CALD in pediatric patients (&lt;18yrs)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rich Colvin</strong>: <em>A final decision by the EC for SKYSONA is anticipated in mid-2021. Due to the highly coordinated and specialized nature of administering gene therapy in rare diseases, the company is partnering with institutions in Europe that have expertise in stem cell transplant as well as in treating patients with ALD to create qualified treatment centers that will administer SKYSONA. In addition, the company has submitted SKYSONA for a pan-European clinical assessment to facilitate access through cross-border healthcare pathways for patients who do not have local country access.</em></p>

<p><strong>Patti:</strong> <em>Over the next five years, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) and the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation (BMSF) will invest $300 million to address health inequities as well as improve diversity and inclusion within the clinical trial space. Our main objectives are to accelerate disease awareness among at-risk patients and advocate for policies that promote health equity, improve workforce representation, expand employee giving to social justice organizations, and improve clinical trial diversity. Of note, given the depth and importance of all of these topics, many of them were also recently discussed during an interactive session facilitated through the </em><em><a href=""https://www.covidadvocacyexchange.com/"">COVID Advocacy Exchange</a></em><em> – a platform developed in partnership with GRYT Health that unites advocacy organizations, patients and industry leaders to synchronize efforts, facilitate resource sharing, and collaborate. I encourage everyone to check it out!</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Back to the $300M investment, BMS has committed $50M of these funds for corporate giving grants to patient advocacy groups and community-based organizations focused on disease awareness and education, and health equity projects in diverse and disproportionately affected populations and communities. $100M will go toward ensuring patient affordability and support programs reach diverse, low-income and medically underserved patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>On the Foundation side, $50M has been committed to health equity grants in the U.S., and $100M of the total investment is committed to develop a program with National Medical Fellowships to train a new generation of health care professionals that extends the reach of clinical trials into underserved patient populations in urban and rural U.S. communities. This program will also provide mentorship to 250 new clinical investigators who are racially and ethnically diverse or who have a demonstrated commitment to increasing diversity in clinical trials, exposing them to a clinical research career pathway.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Any clinical trials specifically focused on LGBTQ groups?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Patti:</strong> <em>We know the LGBTQ+ community has long been medically underserved and experiences disparities in care, including within oncology, which can lead to poorer outcomes and overall health among LGBTQ+ patients. Fortunately, the Moffit Cancer Center has taken the initiative to address unique gaps in care faced by this community through research and provider education programs. I am proud to share that the BMSF and the BMS PRIDE Alliance employee resource group are collaborating with the Center on one of these programs to launch a nationwide study that will ultimately help educate oncologists to address health care disparities among LGBTQ+ patients. The study’s findings will inform an educational program called the Curriculum for Oncologists on LGBTQ+ populations to Optimize Relevance and Skills (COLORS) Training Program, which aims to improve knowledge of LGBTQ+-related issues across the cancer care continuum.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What all-patient support programs is BMS planning to initiate in 2021?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Patti:</strong> <em>As part of our continued commitment to patients worldwide, we regularly engage with the global patient advocacy community across disease areas. In 2020 in particular, we tried to better understand how they were being impacted by the pandemic. Through our conversations we heard that advocates’ biggest concerns were/are time and capacity constraints, infrastructure needs, and the lasting financial impact from the current crisis. In response to these urgent needs, as I briefly mentioned earlier, BMS and GRYT Health partnered to launch the COVID Advocacy Exchange (CAE) in May 2020 to better support advocates and provide them with resources necessary to fulfill their missions. So, though it isn’t being “initiated” in 2021, the CAE will continue in the year ahead with even more sessions and resources, and transition to become “The Exchange” as we move beyond responding to the effects of COVID-19. We hope to launch additional all-patient support programs in the future, too.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are there any digital programs being developed or designed under the patient support programs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Patti:</strong> <em>Again, the CAE is a perfect example of a digital program that was designed to support patients and the patient advocacy community. Considering the need for social distancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly realized that conferences, support groups, and other in-person events would be on hold indefinitely. The CAE was created, in part, to fill the role of these kinds of events that help connect and support patients and patient advocates, allowing such interactions to happen completely virtually. Between the live discussions with health care experts, the recordings of the live discussions that can be watched on-demand, and the CAE Exhibitor Hall where advocacy organizations can share information about themselves and their current projects, there are a plethora of resources available for the community to access, all for free. We’re continuing to keep “digital” top-of-mind as we think through future patient support programming</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What steps are being taken to influence gender equality in BMS?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Patti:</strong> <em>In addition to our work to improve diversity and inclusion within healthcare, BMS is also working to expand the diversity of our workforce and company leadership. As a patient-centered company and a global industry leader, we want to ensure that our employees mirror the evolving demographics of the patients that we serve. I am very pleased to say that we achieved gender parity across its workforce in 2015, but we have more work to do. Currently, we are working to achieve to achieve gender parity at the executive level globally by 2022 as well as double executive representation of Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino employees in the U.S.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What programs are BMS working on to expand its employee giving program?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Patti:</strong> <em>One of the things that I think makes BMS unique is our continued effort to grow as a responsible corporate citizen and our dedication to improving the health and wellbeing of those in the communities in which we live and work. As a part of our revised company commitments focused on improving diversity and inclusion, we enhanced the way our employees can contribute to the BMS Employee Giving program. Now, the BMSF will provide a matching donation of $2 for every $1 donated by employees to select organizations focused on social justice and diversity. These organizations include the Equal Justice Initiative and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, among others and were selected by our People &amp; Business Resource Groups based on their impactful work and alignment with our diversity and inclusion values.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Tell me more about the COVID Advocacy Exchange: what did you achieve this year, and what can we look forward to in 2021?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Patti:</strong> <em>We have seen such a tremendous response since launching the CAE in May. The feedback from advocates has been overwhelmingly positive—since launching in May, over 25,000 people from more than 93 countries have visited the CAE website. </em><em>In addition, </em><em>more than 50 patient advocacy groups have set up virtual exhibit booths. I am so pleased with the qualitative feedback the CAE has received as well;</em><em> participants have expressed gratitude for the </em><em>platform and its ability to act as a uniquely collaborative and unifying space as we work to navigate this challenging time together.</em><em> We are so appreciative of participants’ continued support and their willingness to contribute openly and honestly during each session. </em><em>We hope the CAE will continue to serve our patient communities in the long-term and offer accessible resources that meet needs beyond those related to the pandemic.</em></p>

55684,PharmaShots Interview: BoneHealth Technologies' Laura Yecies Shares Insights on OsteoBoost Vibration Belt,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a recent interview with PharmaShots,<strong> Laura Yecies, CEO of BoneHealth Technologies</strong> shared her views on OsteoBoost Vibration Belt that has been granted “Breakthrough Device” designation by the US FDA</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>OsteoBoost receives the US FDA’s BDD to reduce the risk of osteoporosis. It uses vibration technology that delivers mechanical stimulation to the hips &amp; spine at a precise, individually calibrated frequency, encouraging the body to reduce bone resorption &amp; potentially create new bone</li><li>An initial study showed that just one 30min treatment with OsteoBoost reduced bone loss activity in all participants, showing a decrease of 14%, a reduction on par with bisphosphonate drugs</li><li>The NIH funded a $2M to study for determining the positive effects of OsteoBoost in a larger study with a broader population. The study is currently enrolling patients &amp; is scheduled to be completed in early 2022</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we discuss a little about Osteoporosis and how can a medical device be helpful (in the general overview)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laura: </strong><em>A healthy human body is constantly going through the cycle of creating new bone and resorbing old bone. When we are young, we create more bone than we resorb, and our bone density increases as a result. As we get older, this process reaches an equilibrium where we are making new bone and reabsorbing old bone at consistent rates. When we reach middle age the balance starts to swing towards making less bone than we resorb, especially if we aren’t consistently doing high impact exercise that stimulates the body to make bone to withstand the impact. Osteoporosis, and its precursor, osteopenia, is a condition where the body is no longer making bone at the rate it used to, and the bones become more fragile and prone to fractures. As we age, the hips and spine are especially at risk for fractures. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>A medical device like OsteoBoost can be helpful to combat low bone mass (osteoporosis and osteopenia) because it simulates high impact exercise and essentially triggers the body to make more bone than it would have otherwise. This can tip the balance back to equilibrium so that someone with osteopenia (the first stage of significant bone loss) is no longer losing bone at a rate that will cause them to develop osteoporosis, preventing further bone loss and improving their chances of avoiding fractures.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>Can you tell us in detail about the mechanism of action for OsteoBoost, how it works?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":55687,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osteoboost.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-55687""/><figcaption>Bone Health</figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laura: </strong><em>The body responds to high impact exercise (a form of mechanical stimulation) by trying to strengthen itself to withstand future impact through the </em><em>creation of new bone and reduction of bone resorption (the body’s process of breaking down old bone). High impact exercise is a form of vibration, where the “shockwaves” from the impact of your foot on the ground (e.g. running) sends vibrations through the skeleton, stimulating a response from the body to strengthen itself (i.e. the body thinks: “I need to make more bone and resorb less bone to withstand future impact”). OsteoBoost mimics the mechanical stimulation of high impact exercise by sending a gentle vibration through the hips and spine, signaling to the body that it needs to strengthen itself by resorbing less bone and making more new bone. The precise vibration strength and frequency is proprietary, but it has been shown in clinical studies to be safe, comfortable and effective.</em><strong><br></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do we discuss more on how vibration can be an effective treatment for osteoporosis patients? Share some research with our readers.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laura: </strong><em>Vibration was first shown to be effective in reducing bone loss and encouraging bone growth through NASA-funded research. Astronauts tend to lose bone mass when they are in space because without gravity, their bodies see the less mechanical impact with movement. Thus, their bones are used less, so the body resorbs more bone and makes less. The first effective vibration treatments for preventing bone loss were vibration platforms that people stand on for 20-30 mins, These platforms send the vibration through the legs into the rest of the skeleton. While these products worked, the delivery of the vibration was inconvenient (having to stand in one place for 30 mins). OsteoBoost leveraged the NASA research and technology by developing a localized, targeted vibration treatment that stimulates the hips and spine (the areas most prone to debilitating fractures) with a gentle vibration. The OsteoBoost thus encourages the body to shift away from further bone loss towards equilibrium again (making bone and absorbing bone at approximately the same rate and therefore keeping bones stronger as we age). The key innovation of the OsteoBoost is packaging the vibration into a wearable belt that can be worn while doing normal daily activities, making it convenient and easy to incorporate into daily schedules.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><br>Tuba: Discuss in detail about the significant advantages of this OsteoBoost</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laura: </strong><em>OsteoBoost is very easy to use, comfortable, convenient, and has clinically proven effectiveness. There is no other product on the market with this combination of features. It’s as simple and comfortable as wearing a belt. Simply wrap it around you, secure the Velcro, and press start. There is a built-in timer so it will automatically shut off after 30 mins (the recommended treatment time) and you can use it during your normal daily activities like going for a walk, getting ready in the morning, cooking, etc. The vibration is gentle and soothing, with many users reporting that it actually relaxes their lower back muscles. It is proven to reduce bone loss activity, with no side effects, and it is targeted at the parts of the body where a fracture is most devastating the hips and spine. Mortality and morbidity rates are high for hip fractures, and microfractures of the spine are what lead to the hunched-over posture that so many people associate with osteoporosis.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><br>Tuba: Can you discuss the data of the initial study in all study participants</strong>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laura: </strong><em>All 17 post-menopausal women experienced a reduction in the amount of bone they were losing as measured by the biomarker NTX, a standard mechanism to measure bone loss. The average reduction in bone loss across all 17 subjects was 14% and that was after only ONE 30 minute treatment. This is similar to the reaction the body has after high impact exercise or osteoporosis drug treatments.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><br></strong><strong>Tuba: Does Bone health Technologies have any subgroup analysis where any specific population is benefitting more from the device</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laura: </strong><em>We will have this data once the pivotal study is complete, but the initial study did not provide this level of granularity. We don’t anticipate that there will be significant differences in patient sub-groups though, as we believe the mechanism of action will have a similar effect on anyone with osteopenia.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><br></strong><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>Describe in your own words how this device is a game-changer in the care of bones health.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laura:</strong><em><strong> </strong>There is currently no good option for people who are diagnosed with osteopenia. They are told to take calcium (which is marginally helpful), get more high impact exercise (studies have shown that walking is not enough), and they have sometimes prescribed a drug treatment (which can have side effects and is unpleasant for many to take so only 25% of people who are prescribed the drugs complete their treatment). Now with OsteoBoost they will have an easy and convenient way to prevent further bone loss, prevent the onset of osteoporosis, reduce their chance of a debilitating fracture, and all without side effects or the inconvenience or aches and pains associated with high impact exercise.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><br></strong><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>When can we expect to launch of the OsteoBoost Vibration belt?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laura: </strong><em>We expect OsteoBoost to be available midway through 2022.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><br></strong><strong>Tuba: Is Bone health technologies planning to partner or license OsteoBoost. If yes? Then for what geographies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laura: </strong><em>No specific plans for partnering or licensing at this point, but we are active in the bone health community and future collaborations or partnerships are possible.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>Additionally, any highlights from the program and preparation process over the last few months.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laura:</strong><em><strong> </strong>The FDA Breakthrough Device designation is further evidence that those who understand bone health and the challenges of treating osteopenia and osteoporosis believe in the potential for this product. The initial study data was so promising, and this is such a big problem to solve, that the National Institutes of Health provided $2 million in funding for us to pursue the pivotal study. Now FDA has also recognized the potential for this new treatment based on their own analysis, further validating our belief that this is a game-changing technology that can help millions of Americans and eventually people around the world to fight osteoporosis and prevent fractures.</em></p>

62757,PharmaShots Interview: Caris Life Sciences' Dr. Spetzler Shares Insight on AI-Based MI FOLFOXai Predictor,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a recent interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Dr. Spetzler, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Caris Life Sciences</strong> shared his insights on FOLFOXai and its importance in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. He also highlights the data supporting the use of FOLFOXai as a predictor of CT efficacy in patients with mCRC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The validation studies of MI FOLFOXai demonstrated a 17mos. increase in OS, representing 71% difference as compared to those patients treated counter to the prediction</li><li>FOLFOXai is the first clinically validated AI-based predictor of chemotherapy efficacy in patients with mCRC</li><li>Caris offers MI GPSai providing a cancer type similarity assessment that compares the genomic (DNA) and transcriptomic (RNA) characteristics of the patient’s tumor against other tumors in the Caris database</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Can we have a discussion of the study designs of validation studies utilizing AI-Based MI FOLFOXai Predictor?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>David: </strong><em>MI FOLFOXai was validated using two independent data sets to compare the increased benefit arm to the decreased benefit arm. The first study was a blinded, prospective analysis of retrospectively tested samples from 149 cases. The second study involved 296 manually curated cases with real-world evidence obtained from insurance claims records, electronic medical records, and death registries.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Please share the positive results from the validation studies of MI FOLFOXai?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>David: </strong><em>The data published in&nbsp;Clinical Cancer Research&nbsp;demonstrated that the overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated in a manner consistent with the FOLFOXai prediction was 17 months longer than the OS of patients treated counter to the prediction. This represents a 71% difference in OS in patients treated with FOLFOX-FOLFIRI predicted to benefit from FOLFOX-FOLFIRI chemotherapy compared to those predicted to benefit from FOLFIRI-FOLFOX.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Researchers determined a significant difference in OS based on the FOLFOXai-predicted increased benefit or decreased benefit with FOLFOX-FOLFIRI chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additionally, patients predicted to have a decreased benefit from FOLFOX-FOLFIRI chemotherapy had significantly better outcomes when treated with FOLFIRI-FOLFOX than those predicted to have an increased benefit and vice versa. Analysis of samples from the randomized Phase 3 TRIBE2 study, which compared standard chemotherapy with FOLFOX followed by FOLFIRI to the FOLFOXIRI combination, confirmed the ability of FOLFOXai to predict OS for both study arms.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Discuss in detail the findings of exploratory analyses that show benefits in advanced EC/GEJC and PDAC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>David: </strong><em>Exploratory analyses found that FOLFOXai predicted a treatment benefit from oxaliplatin-containing regimens in patients with advanced esophageal/gastroesophageal</em> junction cancers (EC/GEJC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These analyses demonstrated FOLFOXai was predictive of OS, with a median OS difference of 10.1 months in the increased benefit cohort compared to decreased benefit (21.4 months versus 11.3 months) but not the nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine cohort (median OS of&nbsp;10.8&nbsp;months for increased benefit versus 9.8 months for decreased benefit). Data from 104 patients with advanced EC/GEJC demonstrated that FOLFOXai was predictive of the <em>efficacy of oxaliplatin-containing regimens also in this clinical setting (median OS for increased benefit: 14 months versus 8.9 months for decreased benefit).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Did you think precision medicine has the potential to change clinicians’ approach to cancer indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>David: </strong><em>Yes. The results of these analyses establish that precision medicine powered by AI has the potential to change how clinicians approach treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer and other cancers. These data show that the selection of initial therapy has implications for improved treatment outcomes and disease progression. The results of this study demonstrate that FOLFOXai should be considered as part of the initial therapeutic decision-making process in the clinical setting.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Can you share the details of MI FOLFOXai in a nonscientific way for our readers?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>David: </strong><em>MI FOLFOXai is the Caris’ Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based predictor intended to gauge the response a cancer patient might have to FOLFOX chemotherapy followed by FOLFIRI compared to FOLFIRI followed by FOLFOX, both of which are standard of care options and often used in combination. In the case of this study, MI FOLFOXai used machine-learning to test data from real-world evidence, as well as samples from a randomized controlled clinical trial. The results of these analyses demonstrate that MI FOLFOXai predicted a course of treatment that allowed patients with mCRC to live longer.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Why would you choose colorectal cancer? Are you planning to deploy MI FOLFOXai Predictor in other cancer indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>David: </strong><em>Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer globally, with more than 1.8 million patients diagnosed with the disease each year. As many as 25% of colorectal cancer patients will present with Stage IV – or metastatic – disease, where </em>cancer has spread to other parts of the body, making the choice of treatment critical to the patient’s prognosis. The results of recent analyses demonstrate that precision medicine powered by AI has the potential to change the approaches to treatment not only for metastatic colorectal cancer<em> but also other cancers.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; What are Caris’ other AI-driven comprehensive molecular science offerings?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>David: </strong><em>Apart from MIFOLFOXai, Caris also offers MI GPSai providing a cancer type similarity assessment that compares the genomic (DNA) and transcriptomic (RNA) characteristics of the patient’s tumor against other tumors in the Caris database</em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fabian</strong>: <em>Most cell therapies today are produced for a single patient at a time, using that patient’s cells as the starting material. This current process of one dose at a time is very labor-intensive, failure-prone</em>,<em> and extremely difficult to scale with manual methods. Many indications have patient populations of tens of thousands of doses per year, but due to the lack of automated and scalable manufacturing technologies, even the most pioneering cell therapy companies struggle to treat a few thousand patients per year.<br><br>The Cell Shuttle is the first industrial-scale cell therapy manufacturing solution. It is a factory-in-a-box that</em> offers true walk-away end-to-end automation – from loading a patient’s cells<em> to unloading a cell therapy dose ready for infusion. In contrast to any other cell therapy manufacturing solution on the market today, it has the ability to produce up to 10 patient doses simultaneously. This is an order of magnitude improvement in instrument throughput, which is what is required to help our customers scale-out manufacturing from a few thousand doses annually per drug to tens of thousands of doses annually per drug. In this way, Cellares is helping the industry to make cell therapies widely available for patients.<br><br>Another hurdle is the risk of process failure. Many cell therapies today are made-to-order for patients who are terminally ill and have fully exhausted other treatment options. A critical process failure can lead to the loss of a patient’s life, because there may not be another opportunity to collect high-quality starting material from the patient for a second attempt. Through automating and closing the manufacturing process, the Cell Shuttle enables a three-fold reduction in process failure rates by eliminating opportunities for operator error and contamination.<br></em><br><em>Because the Cell Shuttle maintains its own cleanroom environment it can be deployed in lower-class</em> environments, which have a significantly lower cost per square foot. It also reduces the amount of cleanroom space that’s required by about 80 percent compared with manual methods, allowing for smaller manufacturing sites with higher productivity. By automating the entire manufacturing process end-to-end, further reduces the amount of human labor by up to 75 percent for many cell therapy workflows. Overall, we’re confident that we can reduce manufacturing costs<em> by up to 70 percent compared with manual methods, making cell therapies more affordable over time.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What makes Fred Hutch an ideal partner to develop Cellares’ manufacturing platform?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fabian</strong>: <em>For more than four decades researchers at the Hutch have been pioneering treatments for cancer, from the work of Nobel laureate Dr. E. Donnall Thomas to the breakthroughs achieved by Dr. Phil Greenberg, an internationally recognized expert in cancer immunotherapy. The Hutch co-founded Juno Therapeutics in 2013, another leading cell therapy company, and they have a full pipeline of clinical trials including CAR-T cell therapies, natural killer cell therapies, and other cell therapy modalities. As such, they are an ideal partner to provide insights and feedback on our novel technology and ensure it overcomes the challenges with cell therapy manufacturing for the benefit of patients around the world. We have tremendous respect for the organization and are proud to be working with them to advance our mission of accelerating access to life-saving cell therapies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is Cellares planning to raise more funding in the near future to build its manufacturing technology?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fabian</strong>: <em>To date, we’ve raised $18 million in a Series A financing led by Eclipse Ventures, with participation from 8VC and EcoR1 Capital. As the CEO, I’m always looking ahead to ensure we have the resources we need to accelerate our mission and make a profound impact on the future of cell therapy manufacturing. We will be sure to share additional financial updates at the appropriate time.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How can Cellares make an impact on the future of cell therapy manufacturing?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fabian</strong>: <em>The main impact Cellares will have is to accelerate access to life-saving cell therapies, by making them more affordable and widely available to patients in need.<br><br>Additionally, in the context of preclinical process development, the Cell Shuttle enables the high-throughput design of experiment (DOE) studies in scale-down models to generate insights that help determine the best possible process parameters for each cell therapy workflow. In this way, Cellares is building a single technology platform that meets our customer’s needs from the preclinical phase, through the clinic, and all the way to commercial-scale manufacturing. Avoiding the need to change manufacturing platforms, as is usually required, eliminates laborious and expensive technology transfer processes, accelerating market entry by more than a year. The impact that we’re hoping to have is to provide patients with access to life-saving cell therapies earlier than they otherwise would.<br><br>Finally, there may be an impact on the split between autologous and allogeneic methods. One of the main drivers for allogeneic cell therapy is to increase the number of doses per batch, thus decreasing the cost. That said, autologous approaches have several advantages from a clinical perspective, they’re generally safer and the therapeutic effect is more enduring. While the cutting-edge technology we’re developing will support both autologous and allogeneic approaches, I firmly believe that it has the potential to make autologous cell therapy manufacturing much more cost-effective and scalable.</em><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: “Cellares’ revolutionary technology will be a game-changer for the cell therapy industry.’’ Comment on the statement.<br><br>Fabian</strong>: <em>Hearing Dr. Carl June, the pioneer of the first FDA approved CAR-T cell therapy, Kymriah, say that the technology we are building is “gaming changing” was a huge vote of confidence. He had just finished reviewing our system architecture in detail when he said this. It certainly solidified the confidence in our approach and further increased our excitement to bring this technology to our customers and help patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How is the Cellares’ manufacturing technology different from currently available cell therapy manufacturing methods?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fabian</strong>: <em>The Cell Shuttle is different from currently available cell therapy manufacturing methods in a number of ways. Most notably it’s the first solution that allows our customers to scale out to treat tens of thousands of patients annually per drug, without compromising on process flexibility.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The semi-automated systems on the market today lock you into very rigid and narrowly defined workflows. This is very limiting to customers because in cell therapy the product is the process. Cellares is shifting this paradigm by providing biopharma companies, academic research centers and CDMOs with a fully automated platform that integrates modular hardware with flexible software.<br><br>The Cell Shuttle has an incredibly modular system architecture so you can configure which processing technologies are on your platform when you order it and even change it thereafter. The modular hardware works in conjunction with a powerful software suite that enables process development scientists to quickly design and execute bespoke cell therapy manufacturing workflows. Users can effortlessly drag and drop cell therapy manufacturing steps into the order that best suits their unique process. In addition, they have full control over all of the underlying process parameters &amp; visibility into a vast amount of data collected throughout the process. We are putting the power back into the hands of our customers, instead of requiring them to work with external application teams for every protocol change. This is how Cellares offers the best of both worlds—automation and flexibility.<br><br>In the absence of better options, the field has come to rely on companies which make incremental improvements to benchtop instruments that handle one or two processing steps for a single patient at a time. Our scope is much larger. We are providing an end-to-end solution, from loading the apheresis, to automating cell enrichment, cell selection, cell activation, gene transfer, expansion, fill, finish and formulation. What you’re unloading at the very end is a cell therapy dose ready for release testing &amp; infusion into the patient.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Finally, one of the biggest differentiators of the Cell Shuttle is its capacity to produce up to 10 unique patient doses simultaneously. This is an order of magnitude improvement in throughput compared with any other manufacturing solution on the market today. True end-to-end automation in combination with high throughput is what makes the Cell Shuttle the first solution that enables manufacturers to scale out to meet patient demand.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is Cellares working on more solutions to overcome the limitations associated with the manufacturing of cell therapies?</strong><br><br><strong>Fabian:</strong> <em>Right now, we are focusing our attention on continuing the development of the Cell Shuttle to help our customers lower manufacturing costs, accelerate market entry, and scale-out production to meet patient demand. Our long term roadmap includes additional developments that will further the Cellares vision of enabling safe and affordable access to cell therapies for all patients.</em><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you feel competition in this space? If yes, who would be your potential competitor?<br><br>Fabian</strong>: <em>There are other companies providing limited automation of some cell therapy workflows.&nbsp; However, no other technology that we are aware of offers true end-to-end automation, in a closed and flexible platform that is cost-effective and reliable and can scale to tens of thousands of patients annually per drug. This unlocks significant additional revenue for our customers and provides patients with affordable access to life-saving cell therapies. At Cellares we are building the future of cell therapy manufacturing.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we have highlights of the preclinical data of engEx engineered exosomes presented at SITC 2020?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: <em>Codiak’s precision-engineered exosome, </em><a href=""https://www.codiakbio.com/pipeline-programs/exoil-12""><strong><em>exoIL-12</em></strong></a><em>, showed potential to direct and retain IL-12 pharmacology at the tumor injection site, drive significantly greater anti-tumor activity than recombinant IL-12 and induce antigen-specific systemic immunity while avoiding systemic exposure in vivo.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>IL-12 is known to elicit a potent anti-tumor response by activating T cells and NK cells, but many have given up on the target due to toxicity associated with systemic exposure.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Codiak’s engEx Platform can engineer exosomes to alter cellular tropism and increase functional payload delivery in multiple immune cell types. Specifically, an exosome carrying a STING agonist can generate a more potent response at a lower dose than untargeted controls.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://www.codiakbio.com/pipeline-programs/exosting""><strong><em>exoSTING</em></strong></a><em> is Codiak’s exosome candidate for the treatment of solid tumors. The STING pathway, which is part of the innate immune system and known to elicit an anti-tumoral response, has been difficult to effectively drug due to non-selective cell delivery, off-target toxicity, and dose-related systemic toxicity.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; How these data define the potential of engineered exosomes?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: <em>Exosomes are naturally occurring, extracellular vesicles that have evolved as an intercellular messenger system to protect and deliver functional macromolecules between cells. Utilizing its engEx Platform, Codiak can engineer exosomes with distinct properties, load them with various types of therapeutic molecules and alter tropism so they reach specific cellular targets.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The data presented at SITC add to the body of evidence from preclinical trials that demonstrate:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Codiak’s capacity to direct the tropism of our engineered exosomes to target a specific cell type or tissue;</em></li><li><em>The improved tissue-specific delivery afforded by compartmental dosing</em></li><li><em>Codiak’s capacity to control the retention of the exosome in the desired place in the body</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>All three contribute to enhancing the therapeutic index and, Codiak believes, improve our chance of success. We believe this enhanced therapeutic index is an important characteristic of well-tolerated and clinically active therapeutics and may allow us to drug previously “undruggable” targets by increasing potency while reducing the risk of off-target effects.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>:&nbsp; <em>The engEx Platform is Codiak’s proprietary exosome therapeutic engine for designing, engineering, and manufacturing novel exosome therapeutics.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>For decades, researchers have recognized the potential of exosomes. However, the ability to rationally engineer exosomes with predictable and reproducible therapeutic effects has remained an elusive goal. Through years of rigorous research to solve this challenge, Codiak developed the engEx Platform, which enables us to design and engineer exosomes with distinct properties, load them with various types of therapeutic molecules, and direct tropism so they reach specific target cells.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Coupled with our proprietary manufacturing process, we believe our technology is enabling us to unlock the true therapeutic potential of exosomes.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<ul><li><strong><em>Production Bioreactor</em></strong><em> - The cells are cultured at large scale in suspension to produce exosomes, using either fed-batch or continuous (perfusion) technology. We have employed either 2,000L fed batch and 500L perfusion bioreactors. Codiak’s novel perfusion technology makes it possible to generate the large volume of exosomes needed for large patient populations.</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong><em>Purification </em></strong><em>– Exosomes are separated from various types of impurities generated in the bioreactor, yielding product of unparalleled purity and quality.&nbsp; Our propriety process is based on advanced chromatography and filtration technology as opposed to the centrifuge-based technology that has been traditionally employed in the field. We estimate that with a single Codiak GMP production run, we can produce an equivalent amount of purified exosomes that would have traditionally required &gt;2000 centrifuge runs.</em></li><li><strong><em>Exogenous Drug Loading:</em></strong><em> If necessary, exosomes are loaded exogenously with a specific therapeutic payload here.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Discuss the trial design, progresses, and expected milestones for exoIL-12.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: <em>The Phase 1 clinical trial of exoIL-12 is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of exoIL-12 following single ascending subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, followed by repeat dose exoIL-12 into the lesions of stage IA-IIB CTCL patients. Patients with CTCL will be monitored for safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects in blood and tumor biopsies, and local and systemic anti-tumor efficacy using validated CTCL assessment criteria. Preliminary results from healthy volunteers are anticipated by the end of 2020 and safety, biomarker and preliminary efficacy results from CTCL patients are anticipated in mid-2021.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Discuss the trial design, progresses, and expected milestones for exoSTING.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>:&nbsp; <em>The Phase 1/2 dose escalation clinical trial of exoSTING is designed to investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacological activity, and objective tumor response in patients with advanced/metastatic, recurrent, injectable solid tumors, with a focus on tumors likely to be enriched in APCs. Examples of such tumors include metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Safety, biomarker and preliminary efficacy data from the dose-escalation phase of the trial is expected in mid-2021. As part of the Phase 2 portion of the trial, Codiak intends to enroll&nbsp;further expansion cohorts of&nbsp;patients at the optimal exoSTING dose to be identified in the Phase 1 portion of the clinical program.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Discuss in detail the working of Codiak’s two candidates, exoIL-12 and exoSTING.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>:&nbsp; <em><u>Important note:</u> </em><em>exoIL-12 and exoSTING are the first-ever engineered exosome therapeutic candidates to be tested in humans.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em><u>exoIL-12</u></em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>exoIL-12 is designed to allow optimal dosing of IL-12 and overcome tolerability challenges by localizing IL-12 in the tumor microenvironment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Codiak is initially focusing development of exoIL-12 on tumors that have previously shown clinical responses to IL-12 used as a monotherapy, such as CTCL. While the biological rationale for IL-12 as a cancer treatment has been validated in previous human clinical studies, its utility has been severely limited due to serious adverse events caused by systemic exposure</em><em>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Codiak has engineered exoIL-12 to display fully active IL-12 on the surface of the exosome, which is designed to facilitate potent local pharmacology at the tumor injection site with precisely quantified doses. Exosomal delivery has demonstrated limited systemic exposure to IL-12 in preclinical models and resulted in significant and prolonged pharmacodynamic activity and both local and systemic anti-tumor immune responses.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>exoSTING</u></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>exoSTING is an exosome therapeutic candidate engineered with Codiak’s engEx Platform to incorporate its proprietary STING agonist inside the lumen of the exosome&nbsp;while expressing high levels of the exosomal protein, PTGFRN, on the surface. The high-level display of PTGFRN is designed to promote targeted delivery of Codiak’s proprietary STING agonist into antigen presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Engagement of the STING pathway has been validated to elicit an anti-tumoral response, yet therapeutic development has been generally limited by non-selective cell delivery, off-target toxicity to important immune cells in the tumor and dose-related toxicity due to leakage of the STING agonist into the circulation. In preclinical models of exoSTING, the targeted delivery of a STING agonist to tumor resident APCs promoted localized innate immune activation, T cell attraction and expansion in the tumor, and the development of systemic immunity not observed with a STING agonist delivered without exosomes (e.g., “free”).&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:&nbsp; Can we have a glimpse of Codiak’s pipeline? What are the targeted therapy areas of focus?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: <em>You can view Codiak’s pipeline </em><a href=""https://www.codiakbio.com/pipeline-programs/pipeline""><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The most advanced programs are in immuno-oncology. There are also discovery programs underway in neurology and infectious diseases.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>Q1. For our readers, are you able to describe what metastatic breast cancer is, it’s symptoms, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment options etc.?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ken: </strong><em>Despite decades of innovation and recent medical developments, breast cancer remains the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. Globally, more than two million cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year, resulting in nearly 685,000 deaths.<a href=""#_edn1""><strong>[i]</strong></a><sup>,<a href=""#_edn2""><strong>[ii]</strong></a>&nbsp;</sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most patients with breast cancer are diagnosed in the early stages when their cancer is localized in the breast (stage 1). However, some patients will eventually develop metastatic disease (stage 4), which is when <em>cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.<a href=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=60725&amp;action=edit#_edn3""><strong>[iii]</strong></a><sup>,<a href=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=60725&amp;action=edit#_edn4""><strong>[iv]</strong></a></sup></em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Most breast cancer deaths are due to complications from metastatic disease, with only around 26-28% of patients surviving beyond five years.</em><em><sup>6</sup></em><em><sup>,<a href=""#_edn5""><strong>[v]</strong></a>,<a href=""#_edn6""><strong>[vi]</strong></a></sup></em><em> For patients diagnosed with metastatic disease at first diagnosis, survival is much lower with only 6% of patients surviving beyond five years.</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Breast cancer is currently classified into three main subtypes, which guide prognosis and treatment decisions. One of the main subtypes is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive, which means that there are high levels of HER2 present on the surface of tumor cells or a high number of copies of the HER2 gene.</em><em><sup>8</sup></em><em><sup>,<a href=""#_edn7""><strong>[vii]</strong></a> </sup></em><em>HER2 positive disease accounts for approximately one in five breast cancers (15-20%).<a href=""#_edn8""><strong>[viii]</strong></a><sup>,<a href=""#_edn9""><strong>[ix]</strong></a></sup></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Patients with HER2 positive disease are eligible for HER2 directed therapies.</em><em><sup>5</sup></em><em><sup>&nbsp; </sup></em><em>However,despite recent improvements and approvals of new medicines, metastatic breast cancer remains incurable and additional treatment strategies are needed.<a href=""#_edn10""><strong>[x]</strong></a><sup>,<a href=""#_edn11""><strong>[xi]</strong></a></sup></em><em> </em><em>One of the biggest challenges for patients with HER2 positive metastatic disease has been identifying a treatment that produces a durable response in later line settings.<a href=""#_edn12""><strong>[xii]</strong></a></em><em></em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>There has been no clear standard of care for patients with metastatic HER2 positive disease following progression on second-line treatment.</em><em><sup>16</sup></em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>Patients in the previously treated setting (third- or later-line) generally have a median progression-free survival (PFS) of between 3.3-9.6 months.</em><a href=""#_edn13""><em><strong>[xiii]</strong></em></a><em><sup>,</sup></em><a href=""#_edn14""><em><strong>[xiv]</strong></em></a><em><sup>,</sup></em><a href=""#_edn15""><em><strong>[xv]</strong></em></a><em><sup></sup></em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>Can you share the clinical data that supports the NICE recommendation for ENHERTU?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ken: </strong><em>The recommendation from NICE is based on the results of the single arm, global, multicenter, open label, phase 2 </em><a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03248492""><em>DESTINY-Breast01</em></a><em> trial of trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg/kg) in 184 patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who had received two or more prior anti-HER2-based therapies.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Results from the data cut-off in June 2020 demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 61.4% (95% CI: 54.0-68.5), including a 6.5% complete response rate and a 54.9% partial response rate. After a median follow-up of 20.5 months, the median duration of response (DoR) was 20.8 months (95% CI: 15.0-NR).

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What does the availability of ENHERTU via the CDF mean for women with metastatic breast cancer in England?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ken<em>: </em></strong><em>The Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) is a source of funding for cancer drugs in England. It provides access to promising new treatments, via managed access arrangements, while further evidence is collected to address clinical uncertainty, giving patients access to these treatments much earlier than before.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As such, NICE has recommended trastuzumab deruxtecan for use on the CDF meaning that eligible women with metastatic breast cancer in England can access these treatments imminently in advance of a decision from NICE on routine funding through the NHS.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When can we expect ENHERTU to be available in the UK completely and what are your plans for other EU countries?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ken:</strong> <em>Trastuzumab deruxtecan is currently available via the CDF to eligible patients in England and the data collection period is expected to end when sufficient data have been collected to address the committee’s uncertainties. Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are committed to working with regulatory and payer agencies as they review trastuzumab deruxtecan to ensure that there is equitable patient access across the four UK nations. Discussions with Welsh and Northern Irish health authorities are ongoing. Submission for the appraisal of trastuzumab deruxtecan to the Scottish Medicines Consortium is currently in development, with a decision expected later in 2021.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In January 2021, trastuzumab deruxtecan was granted conditional approval in Europe as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens. The approval is for all EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. We are in ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities worldwide regarding next steps for the potential use of trastuzumab deruxtecan for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer. </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: In which other regions are Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca seeking approval of ENHERTU?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ken: </strong><em>We are working with heath authorities worldwide to expand the countries where trastuzumab deruxtecan is approved and available. In addition to the UK and the EU, trastuzumab deruxtecan </em><em>(5.4 mg/kg)&nbsp;</em><em>is approved under accelerated approval in the U.S. and under the conditional early approval system in Japan for the same HER2 positive breast cancer indication based on the results from the </em><a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03248492""><em>DESTINY-Breast01</em></a><em> trial.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Trastuzumab deruxtecan </em><em>(6.4 mg/kg)&nbsp;</em><em>is also approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab-based therapy, based on the results from the </em><a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03329690""><em>DESTINY-Gastric01</em></a><em> trial. We are continuing to work with health authorities worldwide to expand access of trastuzumab deruxtecan to more patients with gastric cancer</em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba</strong>: <strong>What are the specifications of ENHERTU – MOA, RoA, dosage and cost?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ken</strong>: <em>Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Trastuzumab deruxtecan </em><em>is comprised of a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody with the same amino acid sequence as trastuzumab attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the next steps for ENHERTU?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ken</strong>: <em>Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca have a comprehensive global development program for trastuzumab deruxtecan underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers, including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba</strong>:<strong> What is the role of ADCs in the management of HER2-positive breast cancer?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ken:</strong> <em>Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are targeted cancer medicines, combining target specificity and potent anti-tumor activity in a single molecule. They are designed to address the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, which attacks both normal and cancer cells. ADCs aim to enable the targeted delivery of the cancer-killing medicine (payload) specifically to the tumor cells while sparing the healthy cells.<a href=""#_edn16""><strong>[xvi]</strong></a></em><em> </em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, trastuzumab deruxtecan is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Trastuzumab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody with the same amino acid sequence as trastuzumab attached to topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This highly targeted approach allows for the efficient delivery of the therapy specifically inside the cancer cells while reducing exposure to healthy tissue.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What other programs/developments does Daiichi Sankyo have/working on to increase its global footprint in oncology?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ken: </strong><em>Daiichi Sankyo’s R&amp;D strategy of “3 and Alpha,” anchored by our DXd ADC technology, is to harness the power of true innovation to discover and develop innovative first-in-class and best-in-class treatments that transform the standard of care for patients with cancer.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of seven ADCs with six in clinical development across multiple types of cancer. The company’s three lead ADCs include trastuzumab deruxtecan, a HER2 directed ADC, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca; and patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), a HER3 directed ADC. Three additional ADCs including DS-7300 (B7-H3), DS-6157 (GPR20) and DS-6000 (CDH6) are being developed through a strategic research collaboration with Sarah Cannon Research Institute.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Each ADC is designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology to target and deliver chemotherapy inside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen. Each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the wider company goals for the next 12 months?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ken: </strong><em>We are dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-class science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of the quality of life around the world.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi Sankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases with high unmet medical needs.

<p><strong><em>Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of DCC-3014 in Advanced Solid Tumors and Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT)</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Company’s international, multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2 study of DCC-3014, a highly selective, oral, investigational switch-control kinase inhibitor of CSF1R, was designed to evaluate its safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in patients with malignant solid tumors and tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT). TGCT is a rare disease caused by a translocation in colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) gene resulting in overexpression of CSF1 and recruitment of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)-positive inflammatory cells into the lesion. TGCT is also known as a giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS) or pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), a diffuse-type of TGCT. Although benign, these tumors can grow and cause damage to surrounding tissues and structures inducing pain, swelling, and limitation of movement of the joint. Surgery is the main treatment option; however, these tumors tend to recur, particularly in diffuse-type TGCT. If untreated or if the tumor continually recurs, damage and degeneration may occur in the affected joint and surrounding tissues, which may cause significant disability.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Data presented at the CTOS 2020 Virtual Annual Meeting are from 25 TGCT patients enrolled in the dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1/2 study. The cutoff date for the safety data was September 23, 2020, and the cutoff date for the efficacy data was October 5, 2020, which included 22 evaluable patients.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Ripretinib demonstrated activity across all KIT/PDGFRA mutations in patients with fourth-line advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor: Analysis from the phase 3 INVICTUS study</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Results from an exploratory analysis from the Phase 3 INVICTUS study showed that QINLOCK demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in patients with a broad spectrum of KIT and PDGFRA mutations. The data cutoff for this analysis was March 9, 2020.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In INVICTUS, QINLOCK demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in patients with fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST (n=129) with multiple, heterogeneous genetic subsets of KIT/PDGFRA mutations. QINLOCK showed a median progression-free</em> survival (PFS) benefit of 6.3 months versus a <em>placebo of 1 month in all patients (hazard ratio = 0.16).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The HRs of PFS within different mutation subgroups all favored treatment with QINLOCK, which is in line with the primary outcome of the INVICTUS study. These results support the proposed broad mechanism of action of QINLOCK with its specific receptor-binding properties.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Is Deciphera planning to assess QINLOCK in other than the 4th and 2nd lines in GIST?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Matthew:</strong><em> &nbsp;We are focused on exploring the full potential of QINLOCK to benefit people with GIST. Our near-term focus for further clinical development remains in the second-line treatment setting. We recently completed target enrollment in the Phase 3 INTRIGUE study, in which we are comparing QINLOCK to sunitinib in the 2nd line, and expect to provide top-line data for this study in the second half of 2021. We believe QINLOCK has the potential to play an even broader role in the treatment of GIST.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Are you planning to expand the potential of QINLOCK in other indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Matthew:</strong><em> &nbsp;Deciphera is focusing its resources on first exploring the full potential of QINLOCK in GIST including earlier lines of treatment and expanding access to QINLOCK for people with GIST outside the United States.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Does Deciphera plan to assess DCC-3014 in indications other than TGCT?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Matthew:</strong><em> &nbsp;We do see a potential path forward to evaluate DCC-3014 in other indications, both as monotherapy and in combination, but it’s too early to discuss specific studies and for now our near-term focus is on developing DCC-3014 for patients with TGCT.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong>&nbsp;<strong>What are the novel mechanism of actions of QINLOCK and DCC-3014?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Matthew:</strong><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>QINLOCK Mechanism of Action:</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>QINLOCK is a novel switch-control tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) specifically designed to broadly inhibit KIT and PDGFRA kinase signaling through a dual mechanism of action that secures the kinase into an inactive conformation, resulting in inhibition of downstream signaling and cell proliferation. QINLOCK precisely and durably binds to both the switch pocket region and the activation loop to lock the kinase in the inactive ""off"" state. Portions of QINLOCK mimic the inhibitory loop and occupy the switch pocket, thereby preventing the activation loop's entry. Other residues on QINLOCK bind to the activation loop, stabilizing it out of the switch pocket and covering the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site, so kinase activation cannot occur. This dual mechanism of action secures KIT and PDGFRA kinases in their inactive conformations providing broad in vitro inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA kinase activity, including wild type and multiple primary and secondary mutations.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>DCC-3014 Mechanism of Action:</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>DCC-3014 is an investigational, orally-administered, potent, and highly selective switch-control kinase inhibitor of CSF1R. DCC-3014 was designed to selectively bind to the CSF1R switch pocket. It has greater than 100-fold selectivity for CSF1R over the closely related kinases FLT3, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRß, and VEGFR2 and has even greater selectivity for CSF1R over approximately 300 other human kinases that we tested. DCC-3014 inhibits CSF1R signaling in cellular assays, as well as blocks macrophage-mediated tumor cell migration, osteoclast differentiation, and proliferation of a CSF1R-dependent cell line.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Please provide any relevant information about the rest of the company’s pipeline programs and their targeted indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Matthew:</strong><em> &nbsp;Enabled by Deciphera’s proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor, the company has developed a diverse pipeline of wholly-owned drug candidates. The company has used its platform to develop its approved drug, QINLOCK, and two clinical programs DCC-3014 and rebastinib, and one preclinical program, DCC-3116, that we expect to enter clinical development in 2021.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Overview of the Rebastinib Program:</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Rebastinib is a potent and selective TIE2 inhibitor, which is currently being studied in combination with chemotherapy. TIE2 is a target primarily expressed in endothelial cells and TIE2-expressing macrophages, or TEMs, and plays an important role in angiogenesis as part of the angiopoietin/TIE2 signaling axis.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We presented positive initial data from the endometrial cohort at the ASCO 2020 Virtual program showing promising preliminary anti-tumor activity and favorable tolerability:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>• An objective response rate of 39%, confirmed and unconfirmed.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>• A clinical benefit rate of 72% at eight weeks in heavily pre-treated patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition, data presented at the ESMO Virtual Congress 2020 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer demonstrated encouraging initial activity:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>• An objective response rate of 38%, confirmed and unconfirmed.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>• A clinical benefit rate of 88% at eight weeks in heavily pre-treated patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Deciphera is currently studying rebastinib in a Phase 1b/2 clinical study in combination with paclitaxel (NCT03601897) and in a Phase 1b/2 clinical study in combination with carboplatin (NCT03717415).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Overview of the DCC-3116 Program:</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>DCC-3116 is a small molecule and potential first-in-class ULK kinase inhibitor discovered using our novel switch-control kinase inhibitor platform. DCC-3116 is designed to inhibit autophagy, a key tumor survival mechanism in cancer cells, by inhibiting the ULK kinase, which has been shown to be the initiating factor that activates autophagy. In the near-term, we expect to file an IND for DCC-3116 for the potential treatment of RAS mutant cancers in combination with inhibitors of downstream RAS effector targets including RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors as well as with direct inhibitors of mutant RAS.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Are you looking for collaborations to develop and commercialize any of your therapies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Matthew:</strong><em>  Our current focus is on moving our clinical development efforts forward in each of our programs to achieve our mission to discover, develop and deliver important new medicines to patients for the treatment of cancer. We continue to evaluate the most efficient path forward for our programs, whether that be in partnership or on our own.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Can we have the highlights of your presentation at ASN Week 2020 in a non-scientific way?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> <em>Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a family of rare genetic disorders causing hepatic oxalate overproduction that can result in life-threatening kidney damage. In PH, excess oxalate can lead to chronic kidney stones, progressive kidney damage including the possibility of end-stage renal disease, and systemic oxalosis. There are three known PH subtypes – PH1, PH2, and PH3 – and there is currently no available treatment approved for this rare disease. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>At ASN Kidney Week 2020, we presented an interim analysis of safety and efficacy data from our ongoing long-term, open-label clinical study of Nedosiran (a study we call PHYOX™3), which is our lead investigational candidate in development for PH1, PH2, and PH3. A key PH measure is the oxalate excretion in urine (urinary oxalate), and we presented data on once-monthly dosing of Nedosiran in participants with PH1 and PH2 who had previously participated in our Phase 1 study and had reached Day 180 of the PHYOX3 trial: </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>All PH1 participants achieved normal urinary oxalate excretion at one or more timepoints by Day 180;</em><em></em></li><li><em>All PH2 participants achieved normal or near-normal urinary oxalate excretion at one or more timepoints by Day 180;</em><em></em></li><li><em>Nedosiran was well tolerated, and no serious safety concerns were identified in this trial patient population.</em><em></em></li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> &nbsp;<em>We are evaluating Nedosiran in the PHYOX development program, which includes multiple clinical studies of all three known PH subtypes – PH1, PH2, and PH3. The PHYOX3 trial is a long-term, open-label study into which any participant previously completing a PHYOX trial may enroll, as well as their siblings with PH who are between the ages of six and 18. Another important trial in our PHYOX program is our pivotal PHYOX2 trial, for which we are targeting enrollment completion by the end of 2020 and trial completion in the first half of 2021, which would position us to submit a New Drug Application next year.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss in detail about the complete PHYOX clinical program?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Doug</strong><strong>:</strong> &nbsp;<em>The PHYOX program comprises multiple trials inclusive of the three known subtypes of PH, adults and adolescents, and patients with varying renal status. The following is a high-level summary of PHYOX clinical trials:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>PHYOX1 was a Phase 1 safety and efficacy study of Nedosiran in participants with PH1 or PH2; this study is complete. </em></li><li><em>PHYOX2 is our ongoing double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal trial. </em></li><li><em>PHYOX3 is the aforementioned ongoing open-label trial evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of Nedosiran.</em></li><li><em>PHYOX4 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in participants with PH3. </em></li><li><em>PHYOX7 is a multidose trial in participants (birth to adult) with PH and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</em></li><li><em>PHYOX8 is an open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Nedosiran in children 0-5 years old with PH.</em></li><li><em>PHYOX-OBX is a natural history study to evaluate the association between urinary oxalate excretion and kidney stone formation rate in PH3, the least researched and least understood the type of PH. </em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are the plans for NDA submission on track? Was there any impact of COVID-19 pandemic or any other factor on the regulatory submission?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Doug</strong><strong>:</strong> &nbsp;<em>Early in the pandemic, we, like many others, took steps in an effort to ensure business and clinical trial continuity during what was a highly fluid and unprecedented time. For the PHYOX program, we were able to transition certain site visits to a combination of at-home nurse visits with investigator telehealth assessments for dose administration and safety follow-up, enabling our development program to continue, albeit at a slightly slower pace. We were able to update our trial timelines in August and have guided to enrollment completion for the pivotal PHYOX2 trial by year-end 2020, which should set up us for an NDA submission in the third quarter of 2021.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;</strong><strong>Which countries would be mainly targeted for nedosiran's approval?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Doug</strong><strong>:</strong> &nbsp;<em>We are seeking to have nedosiran approved and available globally.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;</strong><strong>Can we have a discussion on ultra-rare Primary Hyperoxaluria (PH) and its epidemiology?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> &nbsp;<em>Using genetic studies, we believe PH is more common than previously realized. It is estimated that approximately 2,700 people in the U.S. have PH1, 1,700 have PH2 and approximately 4,100 have PH3, while diagnosis rates are estimated to be ~40-50%, ~10%, and ~7%, respectively. Epidemiology data suggest that there are similar numbers of patients in Europe. There is less data about PH in other parts of the world, but it’s likely that the disease occurs in all populations. As the first described subtype, PH1 is the most well-known and understood of the three, yet all PH subtypes are likely underdiagnosed.</em></p>

<p><strong>Doug<em>:</em></strong><em> &nbsp;Our proprietary GalXC technology leverages a naturally occurring biologic process, ribonucleic acid interference, or RNAi, to create therapies that silence disease-causing genes. Our powerful platform enables us to develop highly selective and specific RNAi compounds that have a unique configuration known as a tetraloop. This configuration interfaces effectively with the RNAi process and allows us to easily modify a compound’s chemical structure to maximize stability and potency. Our current GalXC RNAi technology is optimized to target liver diseases, and our scientists are further developing our technology to target diseases in other organ systems.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our first collaboration was announced in November 2017 with Boehringer Ingelheim and focused on chronic liver diseases. Since then, we have established collaborations with Alexion to create RNAi therapies for complement-mediated diseases; Lilly for new medicines for cardiometabolic disease, neurodegeneration, and pain; Roche for chronic hepatitis B virus infection; and with Novo Nordisk for cardiometabolic diseases.</em></p>
