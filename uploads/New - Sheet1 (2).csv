Vrinda,40676,Konan Medical Receives FDA 510(k) Approval for its objectiveFIELD Device,"objectiveFIELD, a Ground Breaking, FDA 510(k) Cleared Objective Perimeter Announced by Konan Medical USA","Konan acquired objectiveFIELD Device from Australian National University (ANU) including 15 issued patents in 9 countries, 6 patients in the process, and clinical data for multiple diagnostic indications and was examined for visual-field manifestations
 The medical device was investigated in Australia for >12 years with >1600 examinations across normal, glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, concussion, and other neuro-vision disorders
 objectiveFIELD is a novel, FDA approved human visual field device used to test both the eyes simultaneously in minutes with no manual efforts, using multi-focal pupil objective perimetry method (mfPOP)","objectiveFIELD is a novel, FDA-cleared device designed to assess the human visual field in a completely objective and non-contact manner. Unlike the conventional method currently in use in most eye doctors’ offices, there is no need for any manual input from the patient. Using a patented multi-focal pupil objective perimetry method (mfPOP), objectiveFIELD tests both eyes simultaneously in only a few minutes.

objectiveFIELD has been clinically researched in Australia over more than a 12-year period with more than 16,000 examinations across normal, glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, concussion, and other neuro-vision conditions.1 objectiveFIELD was acquired from the Australian National University (ANU), includes novel features licensed from Seeing Machines™, and is the brain-child of noted researcher Ted Maddess, PhD, with his team “The Maddess Group – Diagnostics for Eye Diseases”, at the John Curtin School of Medical Research. Intellectual property acquired by Konan includes 15 issued patents in 9 countries, 6 patents in process, and clinical data to support a wide range of important diagnostic indications.

The worldwide premiere of objectiveFIELD will be at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting in Chicago from October 26-30, 2018 at Konan Medical Booth # 2515 and it will also be showcased at the American Academy of Optometry in San Antonio, TX, November 7-9, 2018.

“The initial roll-out of objectiveFIELD will feature an easy-to-use, easy-to-administer, engaging experience for the patient,” said Charles Wm. Stewart, Chief Executive Officer of Konan Medical USA. “The test is administered with both eyes open, takes only minutes to complete and represents a welcome new paradigm for patients, technicians and doctors. Additional features with supportive data are expected to be delivered as regulatory requirements are met.”

Ted Maddess, PhD added, “Konan Medical, with their expertise both in pupil tracking applications and with high precision ophthalmic diagnostic devices, was a great selection for ANU. We are excited to get objectiveFIELD to market after an extensive research, development and clinical testing phase.”

objectiveFIELD has also been clinically researched for use in concussion assessment at ANU that are thought to have visual-field manifestations. Recently Gordon Waddington, Professor of Sports Medicine at the Australian Institute of Sport, and Professor Braden McGrath, at the University of Canberra, additionally have helped conduct novel measures of visual function related to concussion injuries with objectiveFIELD technology.

According to Marketscope’s 2018 Ophthalmic Diagnostic Equipment Report, it is expected that there will be about 149,008 perimeters in service in the global market in 2018, including 11,021 new perimeters sold annually, growing more than 2% per year, and representing more than $260,000,000 in global annual sales.

Vrinda,40677,Palette Life Sciences Signs a Worldwide Commercialization and Development Agreement with Nestle Skin Health,"Palette Life Sciences and Nestlé Skin Health Enter into Global Licensing Agreement for Deflux, Solesta and Barrigel","Palette to receive global development rights for Nestle’s Deflux, Solesta and Barrigel and will focus on its commercialization. Nestle will continue to develop the license products for Palette
 The licensed products are developed by using Nestle’s NASHA technology, used for injecting and creating firm gel texture. Additionally, Pharmanest AB will be renamed as Palette Life Sciences AB in Sweden and the US
 Deflux IV & Solesta are novel FDA approved treatments for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) & fecal incontinence respectively. Barrigel IV is EU approved treatment for protection of the rectal wall when treating prostate cancer with radiation","Transaction creates a fully-integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on improving patient outcomes for urology & urogynecology disorders, colorectal conditions, radiot

STOCKHOLM,  Palette Life Sciences AB (formerly known as Pharmanest AB*) has entered into definitive agreements with Nestlé Skin Health to license worldwide commercialization and development rights for Deflux®, Solesta® and Barrigel™. Palette is currently developing Lidbree™ for pain relief for gynecological applications.
Key highlights for the Nestlé Skin Health transaction include:
Exclusive rights to fully develop and commercialize the three products:
Deflux – the only FDA-approved injectable treatment of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a malformation of the urinary bladder that affects 1% of children worldwide. VUR can cause severe infections of the urinary tract and lead to irreversible kidney damage.
Solesta – the only FDA-approved injectable treatment for fecal incontinence, which is also cleared for commercialization in Europe. Fecal incontinence is a debilitating health problem afflicting about 2% of people worldwide with four times more prevalence in women than men.
Barrigel – a biodegradable injectable treatment for protection of the rectal wall when treating prostate cancer with radiation. The product is approved in Europe and will be further developed for future market introduction in the US.
Palette Life Sciences will focus immediately on commercialization activities for Deflux and Solesta, and will begin activities to enable worldwide commercialization of Barrigel.
The license can enable future new products intended for management of urological and gastroenterological conditions, and protection of adjacent healthy organs and tissue during radiation therapy for cancer.
The products are all based on the Nestlé Skin Health’s well-known and widely utilized NASHA™ technology. Millions of patients have been treated with NASHA based products for various medical conditions world-wide. The most well-known NASHA product marketed by Nestlé Skin Health is Restylane®, a leading dermal filler.
Nestlé Skin Health will continue to manufacture the licensed products on behalf of Palette Life Sciences.
As part of the transaction, Pharmanest AB will be renamed Palette Life Sciences AB with offices in Sweden and the US.
*Name change pending
“We are very pleased with the transaction with Nestlé Skin Health. It represents a first and significant step in the development of a global medical device company with significant commercial assets in several underserved medical conditions,” said Mattias Klintemar, Investor Director at The Baltic Sea Foundation, a lead investor in Palette Life Sciences. “Our ambition is to develop Palette Life Sciences into a global leader in the medical categories in which the company provides solutions.”
In a comment on the partnership, Andrew J. Kirsch, M.D., Professor and Chief of Pediatric Urology at Emory University School of Medicine and Director of Robotic Surgery at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta said, “I have used endoscopic injection of Deflux for decades and I am enthusiastic about the new ownership’s commitment to education and research within our subspecialty surrounding Deflux. We have studied Deflux extensively in a systematic fashion and have found it to be safe and effective in preventing UTIs (urinary tract infections) in children.”
NASHA technology is easy to inject and can create a precise and firm gel texture intended for creating and maintaining a pronounced space in the body. This versatility is a benefit in a wide variety of medical applications including the creation and maintenance of space around cancer tumors during different forms of radiation therapy. NASHA gel was the first HA spacer used for to protect sensitive tissue such as the rectal wall during radiation treatment of prostate cancer in 2007.
“The NASHA technology offers an advanced gel solution for spacing critical healthy tissues from high dose target regions, preventing toxicities and giving physicians confidence that they are using a gel designed with the patient’s safety in mind with a favorable ease of use,” said Dr. Jean-Philippe Pignol MD, PhD, Professor of Radiation Oncology, Dalhousie University, Canada, and previous Chair of Radiation Oncology at Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. “We have used this product on many patients and were very impressed by the possibility of sculpting with a great degree of precision the exact spacer we needed during radiation treatment. We are thrilled that Palette Life Sciences is bringing Barrigel to the market and will make it available to the radiation oncology field.”
In addition to the newly licensed NASHA products, Palette Life Sciences’ product portfolio includes Lidbree, a proprietary novel delivery technology that provides short-acting mucosal topical pain relief during placement of an intrauterine device (IUD). The product has additional potential applicability to other important medical procedures including certain types of hysteroscopies. Lidbree will be submitted for European regulatory review later this year.
Back Bay Life Science Advisors, an international strategy and M&A advisory firm, served as strategic and transaction advisor to Palette Life Sciences. Lindahl Law firm and Faber Daeufer & Itrato served as legal advisors.

Vrinda,40679,Novartis Receives EU Approval for Cosentyx's (secukinumab) Label Update in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA),Novartis receives approval for Cosentyx label update in Europe to include dosing flexibility in psoriatic arthritis,"The label update includes dosing flexibility of Cosentyx up to 300 mg based on clinical response & SC structural data of 24 wks., showing inhibition in progression of joint damage in PsA
 Cosentyx label update is based on safety and efficacy of 300mg in follow-up titration & results from P-III FUTURE 5 study (N=996) @24 wks. showing results of no radiographic disease progression in 90% of patients
 Cosentyx is novel inhibitor for IL-17A in PsA & AS, prescribed to 160,000 patients WW. The updated label is applicable in EU including all EEA countries","New Cosentyx (secukinumab) label to include dosing flexibility up to 300 mg, based on clinical response, and 24-week structural data with subcutaneous (sc) regimens[1]
Cosentyx inhibits progression of joint damage in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and shows rapid and sustained resolution of enthesitis, by inhibiting IL-17A[2]-[4]
PsA is a chronic, progressive and irreversible disease leading to pain, fatigue, activity impairment and significant mobility loss due to structural damage[5]
Basel,  – Novartis, a leader in immuno-dermatology and rheumatology, announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved a label update for Cosentyx (secukinumab). Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human treatment that specifically inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), in psoriatic arthritis (PsA)[1]. The new label update includes dosing flexibility of up to 300 mg based on clinical response that will provide clinicians with greater choice for their patients[1].
The label update also includes 24-week structural data with subcutaneous (sc) regimens demonstrating that Cosentyx inhibits progression of joint damage in PsA[1].
“Cosentyx has shown that it can slow the progression of joint damage inflicted by psoriatic arthritis, which can lead to significant mobility loss for patients,” said Paul Emery
Professor of Rheumatology, Arthritis Research UK and Director Leeds NIHR Biomedical Research Centre. “The label update allows dosing flexibility up to 300 mg, giving clinicians and patients greater choice in how to target this progressive and debilitating condition, based on individual response to treatment.”
This label update is significant as PsA can lead to significant mobility loss and irreversible joint damage if sub-optimally-treated[5]. PsA is a chronic, progressive and irreversible disease leading to pain, fatigue, as well as activity impairment and significant mobility loss due to structural damage[5].
The label update is based on Cosentyx sustained efficacy and consistent safety following up-titration to 300 mg in PsA. Cosentyx specifically inhibits IL-17A – a cornerstone cytokine involved in the development of spondyloarthritis and psoriatic disease[1],[6]-[8]. The 24-week structural disease progression data are from FUTURE 5, the largest Phase III study for a biologic conducted in PsA to date (996 patients)[2]. In this study, almost 90% of patients treated with Cosentyx 300 mg had no radiographic disease progression at 24 weeks[2].
“Cosentyx is the only IL-17A inhibitor to demonstrate 5-year safety and efficacy in Phase III studies of PsA and AS. We are reimagining the well-being of patients living with all facets of psoriatic arthritis,” said Eric Hughes, Global Development Unit Head, Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology. “This label update further supports prescribing doctors and patients in their treatment choice.”
The label update is applicable to all European Union and European Economic Area countries and is effective immediately. To date, Cosentyx has been prescribed to more than 160,000 patients worldwide[9].
About Cosentyx
Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human biologic that specifically inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and PsA[1],[6]-[8]. IL-17A is produced by various cells from both the innate immune system (which can be triggered by mechanical stress) and the adaptive immune system[3]. To date, Cosentyx has been prescribed to more than 160,000 patients worldwide[9] and is being evaluated in 100 studies, including a comprehensive head-to-head clinical trial program[10]-[16].

The profit and loss will be shared for AZ will continue to develop Synagis in collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur (division of Sanofi)
 Synagis (palivizumab) is a novel mAb, inhibiting RSV F protein approved for RSV disease. MEDI8897 is a mAb, anti-RSV F indicated for prevention of LRTI caused by RSV","Transaction grants Sobi the right to participate in US profits and losses for MEDI8897
Upfront consideration of $1.5bn plus further contingent payments
AstraZeneca has agreed to sell US rights to Synagis (palivizumab) used for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi). Sobi will commercialise Synagis in the US and around 130 AstraZeneca employees will transfer to Sobi as part of the transaction.
Sobi will also have the right to participate in AstraZeneca’s share of US profits and losses related to potential new medicine MEDI8897. AstraZeneca will continue to develop MEDI8897 in collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi S.A.
Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “We continue to streamline our portfolio, allowing AstraZeneca to allocate resources more effectively, while Sobi’s focus on Synagis will enable infants in the US to continue benefiting from this important treatment. Meanwhile, the successful development and commercialisation of MEDI8897 remains important for AstraZeneca.”
Sobi President and CEO Guido Oelkers said: “I am excited about adding Synagis to our portfolio as it remains the only product preventing RSV infection in this vulnerable patient group with a great medical need. The addition of Synagis will become an important catalyst for Sobi’s future development and will form a powerful platform for growth in rare diseases.”
Financial considerations
Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will receive an upfront consideration of $1.5bn, consisting of $1.0bn in cash and $500m in ordinary shares of Sobi upon completion. This would equate to an ownership interest of 8%, based on the current Sobi share price. AstraZeneca has undertaken not to sell the shares received as consideration for a period of 12 months following the closing date of the transaction. The cash proceeds from the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes.
AstraZeneca will also receive up to $470m in sales-related payments for Synagis, a $175m milestone following the submission of the Biologics License Application for MEDI8897; potential net payments of approximately $110m on achievement of other MEDI8897 profit and development-related milestones; and a total of $60m in non-contingent payments for MEDI8897 during 2019-2021. Under the agreement, Sobi will have the right to participate in payments that may be received by AstraZeneca from the US profits or losses for MEDI8897. The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions and is currently expected to complete very early 2019. AstraZeneca will provide additional information if closing conditions are achieved earlier and the agreement can complete late 2018.
Net income attributable to the arrangements will be recorded in the Company’s financial statements upon completion as Other Operating Income. As part of the agreement, AstraZeneca will de-recognise on a proportionate basis a significant intangible asset related to Synagis. The transaction does not impact the Company’s financial guidance for 2018.
For the purposes of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rule LR 10.4.1 R (Notification of class 2 transactions), the total book value of gross assets attributable to the RSV franchise were $2.2bn at 31 December 2017, of which approximately $1.0bn was attributable to Synagis in the US. In the year to 31 December 2017, the pre-tax profits attributable to Synagis in the US were approximately $118m.
About Synagis
Synagis (palivizumab) is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and young children at high risk of RSV disease. RSV is the most prevalent cause of LRTI among infants and young children.  Synagis is a RSV F protein inhibitor monoclonal antibody (mAb) that acts as a prophylaxis against serious RSV disease.1 It is the only medicine approved for the prevention of serious RSV disease.2 AstraZeneca has an agreement with AbbVie Inc. for the distribution of Synagis outside the US, which will not be impacted by the proposed transaction with Sobi.
About MEDI8897
MEDI8897 is a single dose extended half-life anti-RSV F mAb being developed for the prevention of LRTI caused by RSV in all infants entering their first RSV season and children with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease entering their first and second RSV season. It is being developed for the passive immunisation of a broad infant population and has been engineered to have a long half-life so that only one dose will be needed for the entire RSV season.3 The current development plan includes initiation of a Phase III trial in healthy full-term and late pre-term infants. MEDI8897 has received Fast Track Designation from the US FDA in March 2015.
In March 2017, AstraZeneca and Sanofi Pasteur announced an agreement to develop and commercialise MEDI8897. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca is responsible for all development activity through initial approvals, as well as manufacturing of MEDI8897, while Sanofi Pasteur leads commercialisation activities. The two companies share all costs and profits equally.

Vrinda,40681,GSK's Trelegy Ellipta (Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol â€˜FF/UMEC/VI') Receives Expanded Level Approval from EU for COPD,Once-daily Trelegy Ellipta gains expanded COPD indication in Europe,"The IMPACT study involves assessing of Trelegy Ellipta (qd,100/62.5/25mcg) vs (ICS/LABA Relvar/Breo Ellipta (FF/VI)) (100/25mcg) & ((LAMA)/LABA Anoro Ellipta (UMEC/VI)) (62.5/25mcg) in patients with COPD
 The Expanded label approval will serve as a maintenance treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and shown effective results in comparison to ICS, LABA & LAMA. In 2017, Trelegy Ellipta has also received EU approval for this indication
 Trelegy Ellipta is a novel triple therapy inhaler, with combination of three molecules and is approved in US for airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema","First single inhaler triple therapy to be specifically indicated for COPD patients not adequately treated with dual bronchodilation.
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Innoviva, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVA) today announced that the European Commission has authorised an expanded label for once-daily Trelegy Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol ‘FF/UMEC/VI’), recognising its effect on exacerbations and making it the first single inhaler triple therapy indicated for patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) not adequately treated with dual bronchodilation or with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA).
Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&D, GSK, said, “We are pleased that the European Commission has approved the expanded use of Trelegy Ellipta as this will enable even more COPD patients to benefit from this important medicine.”
While bronchodilation is recognised as the foundation of COPD therapy, many patients may continue to struggle with symptoms and exacerbations over time. The expanded indication for Trelegy Ellipta reflects the evidence supporting its potential benefits in a broader group of patients than originally indicated, giving them the option of taking a once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for the first time.
Dr. Paul Meunier, VP, Respiratory Medicine at Innoviva, added, “We are delighted that once-daily single inhaler triple therapy will now be available for COPD patients requiring a step up from dual bronchodilation, giving them a new option to help manage their disease.”
The label update is based on data from the landmark InforMing the PAthway of COPD Treatment (IMPACT) study which showed Trelegy Ellipta was superior to both the ICS/LABA Relvar/Breo Ellipta (FF/VI) and long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)/LABA Anoro Ellipta (UMEC/VI) in patients with moderate to severe COPD on multiple clinically important endpoints, including reducing exacerbations and improving lung function and health related quality of life.
The new indication for Trelegy Ellipta is as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD who are not adequately treated by a combination of an ICS and a LABA or a combination of a LABA and a LAMA (for effects on symptom control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). It was originally approved in the European Union (EU) in November 2017 as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD who are not adequately treated by a combination of an ICS and a LABA (for effects on symptom control see section 5.1).
About IMPACT
The landmark 10,355-patient InforMing the PAthway of COPD Treatment (IMPACT) study is the first study to directly compare three commonly-used COPD combination treatment classes delivered using the same dose and inhaler. It is the second of two Phase III studies designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of FF/UMEC/VI in a single inhaler compared to other commonly-used COPD combination treatments.[1]
IMPACT evaluated as its primary endpoint the annual rate of on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbations for FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25mcg) compared with its components, FF/VI (100/25mcg) and UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg), two once-daily dual COPD therapies from GSK’s existing portfolio. Results from IMPACT were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.[2]

About Trelegy Ellipta (FF/UMEC/VI)
FF/UMEC/VI is the first COPD treatment to provide a combination of three molecules in a single inhaler that is taken in a single inhalation, once a day. It contains fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid, umeclidinium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist; and vilanterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist, delivered in GSK’s Ellipta dry powder inhaler, which is used across the entire new portfolio of inhaled COPD medicines.
Data from across multiple clinical programmes have demonstrated the benefit/risk of the molecules in FF/UMEC/VI alone and in combination for the treatment of COPD and it has been approved for use in appropriate patients with COPD in both the US and the EU.
FF/UMEC/VI is approved in Europe as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD who are not adequately treated by a combination of an ICS and a LABA or a combination of a LABA and a LAMA (for effects on symptom control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). The European Summary of Product Characteristics is available at: https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/34357
FF/UMEC/VI is approved in the US for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. It is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. It is not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma. Full US Prescribing Information, including Patient Information is available here.
FF/UMEC/VI has been approved in a number of other countries with further regulatory applications ongoing.

About COPD
COPD is a progressive lung disease that is thought to affect around 384 million people worldwide.[3]
For people living with COPD, the inability to breathe normally can consume their daily lives and make simple activities, like walking upstairs, an everyday struggle. Patients with COPD suffer from symptoms of breathlessness and many have a significant risk of exacerbations. Managing these aspects of the disease drives physician treatment choice.
Long-term exposure to inhaled irritants that damage the lungs and the airways are usually the cause of COPD. Cigarette smoke, breathing in second hand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes or dust from the environment or workplace can all contribute to COPD. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when symptoms begin.[4]
Every person with COPD is different, with different needs, different challenges and different goals. Understanding this and providing support to help meet these needs is the foundation of GSK’s work.

GSK’s commitment to respiratory disease
GSK has led the way in developing innovative medicines to advance the management of asthma and COPD for nearly 50 years. Over the last five years we have launched six innovative medicines responding to continued unmet patient need, despite existing therapies. This is an industry-leading portfolio in breadth, depth and innovation, developed to reach the right patients, with the right treatment.
We remain at the cutting-edge of scientific research into respiratory medicine, working in collaboration with patients and the scientific community to offer innovative medicines aimed at helping to treat patients’ symptoms and reduce the risk of their disease worsening. While respiratory diseases are clinically distinct, there are important pathophysiological features that span them, and our ambition is to have the most comprehensive portfolio of medicines to address a diverse range of respiratory diseases. To achieve this, we are focusing on targeting the underlying disease-driving biological processes to develop medicines with applicability across multiple respiratory diseases. This approach requires extensive bioinformatics, data analytic capabilities, careful patient selection and stratification by phenotype in our clinical trials.

Important Safety Information for FF/UMEC/VI in the EU
The following Important Safety Information is based on a summary of the Summary of Product Characteristics for Trelegy Ellipta (FF/UMEC/VI). Please consult the full Summary of Product Characteristics for all the safety information.
FF/UMEC/VI is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to either fluticasone furoate (FF), umeclidinium (UMEC), vilanterol (VI) or any of the excipients.
FF/UMEC/VI should not be used in patients with asthma since it has not been studied in this patient population. FF/UMEC/VI is not indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm.
In the event of deterioration of COPD during treatment with FF/UMEC/VI, a re-evaluation of the patient and of the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken.
Administration of FF/UMEC/VI may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening.
Cardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, may be seen after the administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists and sympathomimetics, including FF/UMEC/VI. Therefore, FF/UMEC/VI should be used with caution in patients with unstable or life-threatening cardiovascular disease.
Systemic steroid effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods.  These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment receiving FF/UMEC/VI should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions.
If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical corticosteroids.
FF/UMEC/VI should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, in patients who are unusually responsive to beta2-adrenergic agonists and in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or in patients with chronic or untreated infection.
Consistent with its antimuscarinic activity, FF/UMEC/VI should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention or with narrow-angle glaucoma.
An increase in the incidence of pneumonia, including pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, has been observed in patients with COPD receiving ICS. There is some evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose but this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all studies. There is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia risk among ICS products.
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. No clinically relevant effects of hypokalaemia were observed in clinical studies with FF/UMEC/VI at the recommended therapeutic dose. Caution should be exercised when FF/UMEC/VI is used with other medicinal products that also have the potential to cause hypokalaemia.
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients. No clinically relevant effects on plasma glucose were observed in clinical studies with FF/UMEC/VI at the recommended therapeutic dose. Upon initiation of treatment with FF/UMEC/VI, plasma glucose should be monitored more closely in diabetic patients.
There have been reports of increases in blood glucose levels in diabetic patients treated with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol and this should be considered when prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus.
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take FF/UMEC/VI.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with FF/UMEC/VI were nasopharyngitis (7%), headache (5%) and upper respiratory tract infection (2%). Other common adverse reactions (reported with a frequency of ≥1/100 to <1/10) include: pneumonia, pharyngitis, rhinitis, influenza, cough, arthralgia and back pain.

About Ralinepag
Ralinepag (APD811) is a next-generation, oral, selective potent, once-daily IP receptor agonist intended for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Arena discovered and developed this drug candidate internally. Ralinepag’s potency on vasodilation, inhibition of proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and inhibition of platelet aggregation, combined with an extended half-life, support its application as a potentially best-in-class agent for the treatment of PAH.
Ralinepag is an investigational compound that is not approved for any use in any country.

Vrinda,40688,Eli Lilly's Lyumjev (insulin lispro-aabc injection) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes,"FDA approves Lyumjev (insulin lispro-aabc injection), Lilly’s new rapid-acting insulin","The approval is based on P-III PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D studies assessing Lyumjev (insulin lispro-aabc injection, 100 units/mL) and Humalog (insulin lispro injection, 100 units/mL), both in combination with either insulin glargine or insulin degludec in adults with T1D and T2D, respectively
 Both the studies resulted in meeting its 1EPs of non-inferior A1C reduction @26wks., when both the therapies dosed at mealtime, Lyumjev demonstrated a superior reduction in blood glucose spikes at both 1hr. & 2hrs. after a test meal, safety & tolerability profile is similar for both
 Lyumjev is a novel formulation of insulin lispro, developed to speed the absorption of insulin into the bloodstream and reduce A1C levels and is contraindicated during episodes of hypoglycemia and in patients with hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or one of the excipients in Lyumjev","INDIANAPOLIS, June 15, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Lyumjev™ (insulin lispro-aabc injection, 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL), Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) new rapid-acting insulin indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Lyumjev is a novel formulation of insulin lispro, developed to speed the absorption of insulin into the blood stream and reduce A1C levels. As a rapid-acting mealtime insulin, Lyumjev controls high blood sugar levels after meals in adults with diabetes, similar to how natural insulin works after meals in people without diabetes.

“Thanks to advances in glucose monitoring, the people with diabetes I treat in my practice are able to more clearly see the blood glucose spikes that happen naturally after a meal,” said Mark Warren, M.D., Assistant Professor of Medicine, Campbell University of Osteopathic Medicine. “With its fast onset, Lyumjev is a meaningful development for people who want their insulin to help manage their A1C and reduce those post-meal spikes.”

The approval of Lyumjev was based on data from the Phase 3 studies PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D, which were randomized, active controlled, treat-to-target comparisons of Lyumjev and Humalog® (insulin lispro injection, 100 units/mL) in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Both studies met the primary endpoint of noninferior A1C reduction from baseline compared to Humalog at 26 weeks, when Lyumjev and Humalog were dosed at mealtime. Key endpoints were adjusted for multiple testing, including the comparisons of one- and two-hour postprandial glucose. In both studies, Lyumjev demonstrated superior reduction in blood glucose spikes at both one hour and two hours after a test meal compared to Humalog.

In Phase 3 studies, Lyumjev and Humalog had similar safety and tolerability profiles. Lyumjev is contraindicated during episodes of hypoglycemia and in patients with hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or one of the excipients in Lyumjev. Hypoglycemia, which can be serious and life-threatening, is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including Lyumjev.

“We are proud to build on our long heritage of developing new insulins with the approval of Lyumjev, an important new treatment option to help control post-meal blood sugar levels,” said Leonard Glass, M.D., F.A.C.E., vice president of Medical Affairs, Lilly. “Keeping blood sugar in the target range following meals can be challenging for people living with diabetes, and the approval of Lyumjev underscores our commitment to meeting their needs.”

Lyumjev will be included in the Lilly Insulin Value Program, allowing anyone with commercial insurance and those without insurance at all to fill their monthly prescription of Lyumjev for $35. When Lyumjev is available in U.S. pharmacies, this savings option can be obtained by calling the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center at (833) 808-1234, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (ET). The list price of Lyumjev will be the same as the list price for Humalog. Lilly is in discussions with insurance providers to make Lyumjev available to as many people as possible.

“Lilly is committed to ensuring all of our insulins, including Lyumjev, are accessible to people living with diabetes through our wide range of affordability options, such as the Lilly Insulin Value Program,” said Adrienne Brown, vice president, U.S. Connected Care and Insulins, Lilly. “We want people who use Lilly insulin and need help affording their medicine to know that we’re here to support them.”

Lyumjev has been approved by regulatory authorities in several global markets, including Japan and the European Union in March 2020. Lilly is currently working to make Lyumjev available to adults with diabetes in the U.S. as quickly as possible.

Patients and healthcare providers with questions about Lyumjev can visit http://www.Lyumjev.com or call The Lilly Answers Center at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979), Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET.

Terms, conditions, and limitations apply to savings cards. Not available to those patients with government insurance such as Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare Part D, TRICARE®/CHAMPUS, Medigap, DoD, or any State Patient or Pharmaceutical Assistance Program.

About the Lyumjev clinical studies
PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D were randomized, active controlled, treat-to-target comparisons of Lyumjev (insulin lispro-aabc injection, 100 units/mL) and Humalog (insulin lispro injection, 100 units/mL), both in combination with either insulin glargine or insulin degludec in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The studies were designed as treat-to-target trials in which each arm was treated to achieve the same level of blood glucose control and evaluated other important treatment effects, such as rates of hypoglycemia and post-meal glucose control. A subset of patients randomized to PRONTO-T1D participated in an evaluation of 24-hour ambulatory glucose profiles captured with blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) over a two-week period. Both studies met the primary endpoint of noninferior A1C reduction from baseline compared to Humalog at 26 weeks, when Lyumjev and Humalog were dosed at mealtime. Key endpoints were adjusted for multiple testing, including the comparisons of one- and two-hour postprandial glucose. In both studies, Lyumjev demonstrated superior reduction in blood glucose spikes at both one hour and two hours after a test meal compared to Humalog. Additionally, in studies evaluating the time action profile of this new insulin, Lyumjev appeared in the blood stream approximately one minute after injection.

PURPOSE and SAFETY SUMMARY
Important Facts About LYUMJEV™ (LOOM-jehv) and Humalog® (HU-ma-log)

Lyumjev is also known as insulin lispro-aabc injection. Humalog is also known as insulin lispro injection.
Lyumjev is a fast-acting insulin. Lyumjev is used to control high blood sugar in adults with diabetes. Humalog is a fast-acting insulin. Humalog is used to control high blood sugar in adults and children with diabetes. Lyumjev and Humalog are available only with a prescription.
Lyumjev comes in two strengths: U-100 (100 units per milliliter) and U-200 (200 units per milliliter). The Lyumjev U-200 prefilled pen contains 2 times as much insulin per 1 milliliter as standard (U-100) insulin. Humalog U-100 contains 100 units of insulin per milliliter. The dose window of the pen shows the number of insulin units to be delivered.
It is not known if Lyumjev is safe and effective for children. It is not known if Humalog is safe and effective for children with type 2 diabetes or for children younger than 3 years of age with type 1 diabetes as there were no studies done with Humalog in these groups of children. If your doctor decides to give your child any insulin products, he or she may give you special instructions.
All Lyumjev and Humalog products contain insulin lispro.  

Warnings

Do not take Lyumjev or Humalog if you have:

symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
an allergy to Lyumjev or Humalog or any of their ingredients.
Do not reuse needles or share your insulin injection supplies with other people. This includes your:

prefilled pen for use by a single patient
cartridges
reusable pen that works with Lilly 3mL cartridges available for Humalog
needles
syringes
You or the other person can get a serious infection. This can happen even if you change the needle. 

Do not change the type of insulin you take or your dose, unless your doctor tells you to. This could cause low or high blood sugar, which could be serious.

Do not use a syringe to remove Lyumjev or Humalog from your prefilled pen. This can cause you to take too much insulin. Taking too much insulin can lead to severe low blood sugar. This may result in seizures or death.

Lyumjev and Humalog may cause serious side effects. Some of these can lead to death. The possible serious side effects are:

Low blood sugar. This can cause:
•    dizziness or lightheadedness	•    sweating	•    confusion
•    headache	•    blurred vision	•    slurred speech
•    shakiness	•    fast heartbeat	•    anxiety
•    irritability	•    mood change	•    hunger
If you are at risk of having severely low blood sugar, your doctor may prescribe a glucagon emergency kit. These are used when your blood sugar becomes too low and you are unable to take sugar by mouth. Glucagon helps your body release sugar into your bloodstream.

Severe allergic reaction.
Get emergency help right away if you have:
•    a rash over your whole body	•    trouble breathing	•    a fast heartbeat
•    sweating	•    a faint feeling	•    shortness of breath
•    extreme drowsiness	•    dizziness	•    confusion
•    swelling of your face, tongue, or throat		
Low potassium in your blood. This can lead to severe breathing problems, irregular heartbeat, and death.
Heart failure. Taking diabetes pills called thiazolidinediones (thIE-uh-zOH-li-dEEn-dIE-OHns), or “TZDs,” with Lyumjev or Humalog may cause heart failure in some people. This includes people who do not have any heart problems. If you have heart failure, it may get worse if you take TZDs with Lyumjev or Humalog. Tell your doctor if you have any new symptoms of heart failure, or if they get worse. Some symptoms of heart failure include: shortness of breath, swelling of ankles and feet, and sudden weight gain. Your doctor may need to change or stop treatment with TZDs and your insulin lispro product.
High blood sugar and ketoacidosis for Humalog insulin pump users. You can have these serious problems when your insulin pump or infusion set stops working. They can also happen if your insulin is no longer effective. For these reasons, always keep extra insulin injection supplies with you.
Common side effects

The most common side effects of Lyumjev and Humalog are:

•    low blood sugar	•    allergic reactions
•    reactions where you have injected insulin	•    skin thickening or pits at the injection site
•    itching	•    rash
•    weight gain	
Other most common side effects with Humalog include swelling of your hands or feet.

These are not all of the possible side effects. Tell your doctor if you have any side effects. You can report side effects at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

Before using

Talk with your doctor about low blood sugar and how to manage it. Also tell your doctor:

about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
about any other prescription medicines you take, especially ones called TZDs.
about all of your medical conditions, including if you have heart failure or other heart, liver, or kidney problems.
if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed.
How to take

Read the Instructions for Use that come with your Lyumjev or Humalog. Be sure to take your Lyumjev or Humalog and check your blood sugar levels exactly as your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to change your dose because of illness, increased stress, or changes in your weight, diet, or physical activity level. He or she may also tell you to change the amount or time of your dose because of other medicines or different types of insulin you take.

Before injecting your Lyumjev or Humalog

You can inject your insulin dose yourself, or you can have a trained caregiver inject it for you. Make sure you or your caregiver:

Check the insulin label before each injection. This will help you make sure that you are taking the correct insulin.
Use a new needle for each injection. You can get a serious infection or the wrong dose of insulin if you re-use needles.
Change (rotate) where you inject your insulin with each dose. This can reduce your chance of getting pits, lumps, or thickened skin where you inject your insulin. Do not inject your insulin into the exact same spot or where the skin has pits or lumps. Avoid injecting into thickened, tender, bruised, scaly, hard, scarred, or damaged skin.
When you are ready to inject

Inject Lyumjev under your skin at the beginning of a meal or within 20 minutes after you start eating a meal.
Inject Humalog under your skin within 15 minutes before or right after you eat a meal.
Staying safe while taking your Lyumjev or Humalog

To stay safe while taking your insulin, be sure to never inject Lyumjev U-200 in your vein, muscle, or with an insulin pump.  Also be sure not to:

mix Lyumjev with other insulins
drive or use heavy machinery until you know how your Lyumjev or Humalog affects you.
drink alcohol or use other medicines that contain alcohol when taking your Lyumjev or Humalog.

 The approval will serve as a novel treatment for gastroparesis with expected commercialization in Q4’20
 Gimoti nasal spray is the novel nasally administered product while Eversana will be responsible for its launch","Commercial Partner EVERSANA Prepares for GIMOTI Launch
Evoke Extends Cash Runway into 2021

SOLANA BEACH, Calif., June 19, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Evoke Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVOK), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on treatments for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the New Drug Application (NDA) for GIMOTI™ (metoclopramide) nasal spray, the first and only nasally-administered product indicated for the relief of symptoms in adults with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis.

“We are extremely pleased to have received FDA approval to commercially market GIMOTI in the United States. This approval represents the first novel pharmaceutical treatment for gastroparesis in several decades. Many times, patients do not experience adequate relief of their gastroparesis symptoms from current treatments, representing a significant need for a new approach to therapy. We are excited to be able to offer health care providers and their patients a unique non-oral treatment option to relieve symptoms and help improve their quality of life,” said David Gonyer, R.Ph., President and CEO.

“Patients with gastroparesis suffer from characteristic symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, bloating, early satiety as well as vomiting which can be severe and debilitating. These patients often have erratic absorption of orally administered drugs due to delayed gastric emptying,” stated Henry Parkman, MD, Stanley H. Lorber Research Endowment Fund and Chair, and Director, Gastroenterology Motility Laboratory, School of Medicine at Temple University. “Unlike oral medications, GIMOTI is administered nasally, bypassing the diseased GI track, allowing the drug to enter the bloodstream directly and therefore may provide predictable delivery of the therapy.”

“Together with our partner EVERSANA, we are now fully focused on executing our commercialization strategy for GIMOTI by leveraging EVERSANA’s integrated suite of capabilities and highly experienced sales and marketing team,” continued David Gonyer, R.Ph. “We anticipate initiating commercial sales in the fourth quarter of 2020.”

The FDA approval of GIMOTI allows Evoke to access its existing $5 million line of credit from EVERSANA to support manufacturing and other aspects of GIMOTI’s commercialization. As of May 31, 2020, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were approximately $4.7 million. Evoke believes, based on its current operating plan, that its cash and cash equivalents, together with the EVERSANA line of credit, will support the company’s operations into 2021, without consideration of potential GIMOTI revenue.

About GIMOTI™ (metoclopramide) nasal spray
GIMOTI is indicated for the relief of symptoms in adults with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis.

Important Safety Information
WARNING: TARDIVE DYSKINESIA

Metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible. The risk of developing TD increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dosage.
Discontinue GIMOTI in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. In some patients, symptoms may lessen or resolve after metoclopramide is stopped.
Avoid treatment with metoclopramide (all dosage forms and routes of administration) for longer than 12 weeks because of the increased risk of developing TD with longer-term use.
GIMOTI is not recommended for use in:

Pediatric patients due to the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia (TD) and other extrapyramidal symptoms as well as the risk of methemoglobinemia in neonates.
Moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child‑Pugh B or C), moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute), and patients concurrently using strong CYP2D6 inhibitors due to the risk of increased drug exposure and adverse reactions.
GIMOTI is contraindicated:

In patients with a history of tardive dyskinesia (TD) or a dystonic reaction to metoclopramide.
When stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous (e.g., in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation).
In patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas. Metoclopramide may cause a hypertensive/pheochromocytoma crisis, probably due to release of catecholamines from the tumor.
In patients with epilepsy. Metoclopramide may increase the frequency and severity of seizures.
In patients with hypersensitivity to metoclopramide. Reactions have included laryngeal and glossal angioedema and bronchospasm.
Potential adverse reactions associated with metoclopramide include:  Tardive dyskinesia (TD), other extrapyramidal effects (EPS), parkinsonism symptoms, motor restlessness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), depression, suicidal ideation and suicide, hypertension, fluid retention, hyperprolactinemia, effects on the ability to drive and operate machinery.

Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) for GIMOTI are: dysgeusia, headache, and fatigue.

These are not all of the possible side effects of GIMOTI. Call your doctor for medical advice about whether you should take GIMOTI and the possible risk factors and side effects. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

About Evoke Pharma, Inc.
Evoke is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of drugs to treat GI disorders and diseases. The Company developed GIMOTI, a nasal spray formulation of metoclopramide, for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adults.

Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder affecting millions of patients worldwide, in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents resulting in serious GI symptoms as well as other systemic complications. The gastric delay caused by gastroparesis can compromise absorption of orally administered medications. Prior to FDA approval to commercially market GIMOTI, metoclopramide was only available in oral and injectable formulations and remains the only drug currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis.

(TOKYO: 4519) and Biofourmis, a Boston-based digital therapeutics company, announced that they have partnered to develop a digital solution for the objective assessment of pain associated with endometriosis.

Pain is one of the main symptoms of endometriosis and therapeutically important. The severity of pain may vary from day to day, and it can be a major issue that affects patients’ quality of life. However, because pain can be a subjective symptom, patients often have difficulty quantifying their level of pain when communicating with healthcare professionals and family members.

The partnership leverages Biofourmis’ Biovitals® platform to co-develop a novel digital technology for the objective assessment of pain using biosensors and artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. The solution will be validated in a global, multi-center observational study enrolling more than 120 endometriosis patients.

Biofourmis has demonstrated its ability to discover, develop and clinically validate multivariate digital biomarkers across multiple therapeutic areas. The digital solution for managing patients with endometriosis in an ambulatory setting will include a wearable, clinical-grade biosensor to capture physiology biomarkers and a patient-facing mobile app to monitor symptoms, with a gamification engine for patient engagement. The AI-based technology will provide a continuous quantification of pain by applying analytics to physiology biomarkers. The platform will also include a clinician-facing web dashboard for remote review and intervention.

“Through the partnership with Biofourmis, a leading company in research, development and commercialization of digital therapeutics, Chugai will set out to objectively assess pain associated with endometriosis and better understand its pathology,” said Satoko Shisai, Chugai’s Vice President, Head of Digital & IT Supervisory Division. “Through this partnership, Chugai is demonstrating its commitment to applying the most advanced digital technologies to better understand the real-life needs of patients and to develop innovative solutions for society, as outlined in the CHUGAI DIGITAL VISION 2030.”

Kuldeep Singh Rajput, CEO and founder of Biofourmis, said: “Chugai aims to become a top innovator by utilizing digital technologies, and we are thrilled to partner with them.” He added: “This unique collaboration with Chugai is another indicator of the growing consensus in the healthcare industry that combining digital solutions with therapeutic developments—from discovery to patient care—is a powerful way to augment efficiency. Digital solutions can deliver faster, more reliable insights to clinicians to aid interventions, while increasing engagement and improving outcomes for patients and lowering healthcare costs for all stakeholders.”

About Endometriosis1
Affecting one out of 10 women in their 20s to 40s, endometriosis is the repeated proliferation and shedding of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, accompanied by dysmenorrhea (pain with menstruation) and chronic lower abdominal pain. It is also a cause of infertility. The disease can interfere with daily life, including absences from work or school, as sufferers find it difficult to do more than lie still when symptoms are severe. The only existing medications are hormonal agents. Moreover, if the pain cannot be controlled by drugs, the only treatment is surgical removal of the endometriotic tissue. Unfortunately, many patients experience a recurrence several years after surgery, making this a disease that has a high level of unmet medical need.

Vrinda,40691,Abbott's IOS-Compatible App Receives the US FDA's Approval for Patients with Neurological Disorder,ABBOTT RECEIVES FDA APPROVAL FOR IOS-COMPATIBLE APP ALLOWING PEOPLE LIVING WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND MOVEMENT DISORDERS TO PERSONALIZE THERAPY VIA THEIR MOBILE DEVICE,"The US FDA approves Abbott’s patient controller app for use on Apple’s smartphone devices, allowing patients with neurological conditions such as chronic pain or movement disorders to manage their therapy directly from their smartphone
 The company plans to integrate the app into Abbott’s NeuroSphere Digital Care, launched in May’2020 which is compatible with Infinity DBS System for patients with PD or essential tremor, Proclaim XR SCS system and Proclaim DRG Neurostimulation system for patients with chronic pain and chronic pain in the lower limbs caused by complex regional pain syndrome or causalgia respectively
 The integration across all Abbott neuromodulation technologies allows physicians to treat patients more easily within their practice who have an Abbott device and Apple smartphone. The patient controller app with personalized access to therapy will be available imminently","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., July 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of the company’s Patient Controller app on compatible personal Apple‡ smartphone devices. At Abbott, this approval allows patients living with neurological conditions, including chronic pain or movement disorders, the ability to manage therapy directly from their personal smartphone.2

With this app approval, the need to carry a separate patient programmer device is eliminated, streamlining the patient’s experience and seamlessly integrating therapy management into their life. This is an important step in the integration and connection of digital health tools that ultimately help patients live fuller, healthier lives.

“For physicians who are prescribing and implanting neuromodulation technologies, the ability to integrate therapies into one’s everyday life is key,” said Alexander Escobar, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine at The University of Toledo, OH. “The COVID-19 global health crisis has demanded access to virtual treatment options, especially for those individuals with chronic medical conditions that may have difficulty coming to see their physician or would prefer not to leave their own home. To ensure our patients are receiving the care they need in the appropriate setting, close follow up is critical. Physicians have the ability to remain engaged with their patients through the Apple device, allowing them to interact and treat debilitating chronic pain.”

“The ability to support the changing needs of individuals living with debilitating chronic conditions, like Parkinson’s, without them having to leave their homes is vitally important in today’s world,” said Drew Falconer, M.D., Director of the Parkinson’s and Movement Disorders Center, Inova Health System in Virginia. “Abbott’s NeuroSphere Digital Care solution, including the new Patient Controller app, allows patients to handle one single device and using the FaceTime application, interact with their provider teams in a convenient, easy-to-use interface — an important attribute for those with tremors or have challenges with mobility.”

The Patient Controller app will be integrated into Abbott’s broader NeuroSphere Digital Care connected care management platform, which became available in May. It is compatible with Abbott’s suite of neuromodulation technologies, including Infinity™ DBS System for patients with Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor, Proclaim™ XR SCS System for patients living with chronic pain, and Proclaim™ DRG Neurostimulation System for patients with chronic pain in the lower limbs caused by complex regional pain syndrome or causalgia. This integration across all Abbott neuromodulation technologies allows physicians to more easily treat the individual needs of each patient within their practice who have an Abbott device and Apple smartphone.

“Patients are seeking digital options to better engage with their healthcare providers and manage their chronic conditions remotely – and this has never been more evident than in today’s pandemic where virtual care is necessary,” said Keith Boettiger, vice president, Neuromodulation, Abbott. “With the continuing rise in interest and demand for these technologies, Abbott, as a pioneer in patient-centric neuromodulation technology, is advancing the field of digital health to deliver on the promise of digital care. The approval of Abbott’s Patient Controller app with personalized access to therapy is a landmark event, as we are now able to provide patients a way to access personalized therapy from a compatible and secure iOS device so that people can live their lives and seamlessly manage conditions like chronic pain and movement disorders.”

The Patient Controller app with personalized access to therapy will be made available starting in the coming weeks. For important safety information please visit the websites for Infinity DBS, Proclaim XR and Proclaim DRG devices.

 Breztri Aerosphere is an approved therapy in Japan and China for patients with COPD and is under regulatory review in the EU. As per the agreement to acquire Pearl Therapeutics, AstraZeneca paid $150M as a milestone on US approval of the therapy for COPD","24 July 2020 07:00 BST
Approval based on Phase III ETHOS trial which showed a statistically significant reduction in the rate of exacerbations compared with dual-combination therapies
AstraZeneca’s Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate) has been approved in the US for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on positive results from the Phase III ETHOS trial in which Breztri Aerosphere, a triple-combination therapy, showed a statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with dual-combination therapies Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate) and PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate).1 The approval was also supported by efficacy and safety data from the Phase III KRONOS trial.2

Dr. Fernando J. Martinez, Chief of Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, US and Investigator in the ETHOS trial, said: “Preventing exacerbations is central to the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Even a single exacerbation can have a negative impact on a patient’s lung function and quality of life, and it can increase the risk of death. Breztri Aerosphere has demonstrated significant benefits in reducing exacerbations in patients suffering from COPD.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Breztri Aerosphere has demonstrated a strong clinical profile compared with dual-combination therapies and offers a meaningful new treatment option for patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a debilitating progressive condition and the fourth leading cause of death in the US. We look forward to discussing all-cause mortality data from the Breztri Aerosphere ETHOS trial with health authorities.”

Results from the Phase III ETHOS trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine1 in June 2020 and results from the Phase III KRONOS trial were published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine in September 2018.2 In both trials, the safety and tolerability of Breztri Aerosphere were consistent with the profiles of the dual comparators.1,2

Breztri Aerosphere is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma in the US or other countries. Breztri Aerosphere is approved in Japan and China for patients with COPD and under regulatory review in the EU.

Financial considerations

Under the terms of the past agreement to acquire Pearl Therapeutics Inc., AstraZeneca will make a $150m milestone payment upon US regulatory approval of Breztri Aerosphere for COPD. This is the final development and regulatory milestone under that agreement.

COPD

COPD is a progressive disease which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness.3 It affects an estimated 384 million people4 and is the third leading cause of death globally.5 Improving lung function, reducing exacerbations and managing daily symptoms such as breathlessness are important treatment goals in the management of COPD.3 Even a single COPD exacerbation may be associated with a significant increase in the rate of decline in lung function,6 a significant deterioration in quality of life,7 and can significantly reduce life expectancy and increase the risk of mortality.8,9

ETHOS, KRONOS and the ATHENA clinical trial programme

ETHOS is a randomised, double-blinded, multi-centre, parallel-group, 52-week trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Breztri Aerosphere in symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbation(s) in the previous year. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations.1

KRONOS is a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Breztri Aerosphere in patients with moderate to very severe COPD regardless of whether or not they had an exacerbation in the previous year. The primary endpoints were lung function parameters.2

ETHOS and KRONOS are part of AstraZeneca’s ATHENA Phase III clinical trial programme for Breztri Aerosphere, which included more than 15,500 patients globally across 11 trials.

Breztri Aerosphere

Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate) is a single-inhaler, fixed dose triple-combination of budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), with glycopyrrolate, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), delivered in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler.

AstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology

Respiratory & Immunology is one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company.

AstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care, and its inhaled and biologic medicines reached more than 53 million patients in 2019. Building on a 50-year heritage, the Company aims to transform the treatment of asthma and COPD by focusing on earlier biology-led treatment, eliminating preventable asthma attacks, and removing COPD as a top-three leading cause of death. The Company’s early respiratory research is focused on emerging science involving immune mechanisms, lung damage and abnormal cell-repair processes in disease and neuronal dysfunction.

With common pathways and underlying disease drivers across respiratory and immunology, AstraZeneca is following the science from chronic lung diseases to immunology-driven disease areas. The Company’s growing presence in immunology is focused on five mid- to late-stage franchises with multi-disease potential, in areas including rheumatology (including systemic lupus erythematosus), dermatology, gastroenterology, and systemic eosinophilic-driven diseases. AstraZeneca’s ambition in Respiratory & Immunology is to achieve disease modification and durable remission for millions of patients worldwide.

All three FINCH trials, involving a broad range of patients, met their primary endpoints. In the trials, filgotinib consistently achieved ACR20/50/70 and other relevant treatment targets, such as DAS28(CRP)<2.6. Filgotinib also inhibited the progression of structural joint damage assessed by modified total Sharp score (mTSS) compared with placebo. Across the FINCH and DARWIN trials, once-daily filgotinib demonstrated a consistent clinical safety profile when administered as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX). Rates of serious infections and herpes zoster were generally similar to adalimumab and MTX, while rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) were infrequently reported.

The CHMP positive opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to authorize medicines in the 27 countries of the European Union, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and UK. A Commission decision is expected in the third quarter of 2020.

Filgotinib is an investigational agent and is not approved for use by any regulatory authority.

About the FINCH Program 

The FINCH Phase 3 program investigated the efficacy and safety of filgotinib 100 mg and 200 mg once-daily, in RA patient populations ranging from early stage to biologic-experienced patients. FINCH 1 was a 52‑week, randomized, placebo- and adalimumab-controlled trial in combination with MTX, enrolling 1,759 adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who had inadequate response to MTX. The primary endpoint in FINCH 1 was ACR20 at Week 12. The trial included radiographic assessment at Weeks 24 and 52. FINCH 2 was a global, 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study evaluating filgotinib on a background of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug(s) (csDMARDs) among 449 adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who had not adequately responded to biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). The primary endpoint in FINCH 2 was ACR20 at Week 12. FINCH 3 was a 52‑week, randomized trial in 1,252 MTX-naïve patients to evaluate filgotinib 200 mg alone and filgotinib 100 mg or 200 mg combined with MTX versus MTX alone in MTX-naïve patients. The primary endpoint in FINCH 3 was ACR20 at Week 24.  The trial included radiographic assessment at Weeks 24 and 52. Filgotinib is an oral, selective JAK inhibitor with preferential activity for JAK1 and JAK 1/3 signaling.

(Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) and SmartPharm Therapeutics, Inc. (“SmartPharm”) announced today the signing of a letter of intent for Sorrento to acquire SmartPharm, a gene-encoded therapeutics company developing non-viral DNA and RNA gene delivery platforms for COVID-19 and rare diseases, with broad potential for application in enhancing antibody-centric therapeutics, including against COVID-19. The transaction is expected to close in August 2020. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Sorrento and SmartPharm previously announced a research and development collaboration to encode and express in vivo Sorrento’s proprietary SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies utilizing SmartPharm’s Gene Mab plasmid nanoparticle platform.

Sorrento plans to accelerate the development of multiple candidates for in vivo gene-encoded expression of Sorrento’s antibodies, starting with Sorrento’s previously announced STI-1499, or COVI-GUARD™, which is currently moving through preclinical and manufacturing requirements with an IND submission targeted for August 2020. The initial clinical trial for STI-1499 is expected to be in ICU patients to ensure safety and potentially allow a preliminary look at efficacy. In vitro results so far have demonstrated STI-1499’s ability to completely neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection at low doses, making STI-1499 Sorrento’s lead candidate for potential cost-effective passive protection against COVID-19.

SmartPharm’s Gene Mab™ platform delivers to muscles a novel low-immunogenic DNA plasmid encoded with a therapeutic antibody for long-lasting expression in vivo. If clinical trials are successful, a single administration of STI-1499dpi (DNA plasmid injection) could allow the recipient’s own muscle cells to produce the antibody for a prolonged period of time after a single injection, potentially providing extended protection against COVID-19 for periods of time that might provide an alternative to vaccines. Manufacturing of DNA plasmids (in bacterial fermenters) can be done with Sorrento’s in-house cGMP capabilities for a fraction of the cost associated with traditional antibody manufacturing.

“We are very encouraged by the preclinical data generated thus far by our STI-1499 neutralizing antibody against COVID-19,” said Henry Ji, Ph.D., CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics. “We are excited about the prospect of leveraging SmartPharm’s Gene Mab platform in combination with our G-MAB library to produce next-generation gene-encoded antibody candidates against a host of pathogens and cancer cell types. Being able to stimulate the body to produce in vivo our most potent antibodies at optimized manufacturing costs will offer an additional competitive advantage as Sorrento transitions from product development to full scale manufacturing and commercialization.”

Daiichi Sankyo is expected to book sales in U.S., certain countries in Europe, and certain other markets where Daiichi Sankyo has affiliates. AstraZeneca is expected to book sales in other markets worldwide, including China, Australia, Canada and Russia.

 

The upfront payment and regulatory milestones will be booked as revenue over the period in which Daiichi Sankyo has contractual performance obligations under this collaboration. Impact on Daiichi Sankyo’s consolidated financials for fiscal year ending March 31, 2021 will be announced at an appropriate time in the future. The collaboration is expected to enhance the corporate and shareholder value for Daiichi Sankyo over the mid- to long-term.

 

About TROP2

TROP2 (trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in many cancers including up to 80 percent of patients with triple negative breast cancer.[1],[2] High TROP2 expression also has been identified in a majority of NSCLCs.[3] Research indicates that high TROP2 expression is associated with cancer cell growth and proliferation and poor patient survival.[4] TROP2 is recognized as a promising molecular target for therapeutic development in various cancers.4

 

About DS-1062

DS-1062, a TROP2 directed ADC, is one of three lead DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo.

 

ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, DS-1062 is comprised of a humanized anti-TROP2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker with a customized drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of four to optimize the benefit-risk ratio for the intended patient population.

 

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that DS-1062 selectively binds to the TROP2 receptor on the surface of a tumor cell. It is proposed that DS-1062 is then internalized into the cancer cell where lysosomal enzymes break down the tetrapeptide-based linker and release the DXd payload.

 

DS-1062 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to or relapsed from standard treatment or for whom no standard treatment is available. The study is currently enrolling patients with unresectable advanced NSCLC and unresectable/advanced or metastatic TNBC.

 

DS-1062 is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

 

About the Collaboration between AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo

Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU (a HER2 directed ADC) in March 2019, and DS-1062 (a TROP2 directed ADC) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and DS-1062.

 

ENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only) currently is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial, and is under accelerated assessment in the EU for a similar potential indication.

 

U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU

ENHERTU is a HER2 directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.

 

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

 

WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY

●　Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.

●　Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.

 

Contraindications
None.

 

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis
Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).

 

Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).

 

Neutropenia

Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.

 

Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.

 

Left Ventricular Dysfunction

Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.

 

Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.

 

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity 
ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.

 

Adverse Reactions
The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).

 

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.

 

ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.

 

The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

 

Use in Specific Populations

●　Pregnancy: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.

●　Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.

●　Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.

●　Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.

●　Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%).

●　Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

 Equidacent will be available as 25 mg/ml as the solution for infusion targeting VEGF and act by inhibiting the binding of VEGF to its receptors on endothelial cell
 The company anticipates EC’s decision in ~60days. The clinical data demonstrated that Equidacent has comparable quality, safety, and efficacy to Avastin","On 23 July 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Equidacent, intended for the treatment of carcinoma of the colon or rectum, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, and carcinoma of the cervix. The applicant for this medicinal product is Centus Biotherapeutics Europe Limited.

Equidacent will be available as 25 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. The active substance of Equidacent is bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody (ATC code: L01XC07) which binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the key driver of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, thereby inhibiting the binding of VEGF to its receptors on endothelial cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF regresses the vascularisation of tumours, normalises remaining tumour vasculature, and inhibits the formation of new tumour vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumour growth.

Equidacent is a biosimilar medicinal product. It is highly similar to the reference product Avastin (bevacizumab), which was authorised in the EU on 12 January 2005. Data show that Equidacent has comparable quality, safety and efficacy to Avastin.

— Kite Becomes First Company with Multiple Approved CAR T Therapies —

SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Kite, a Gilead Company (Nasdaq: GILD), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval to Tecartus™ (brexucabtagene autoleucel, formerly KTE-X19), the first and only approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The approval of this one-time therapy follows a priority review and FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation and is based on results of ZUMA-2, a single-arm, open-label study in which 87 percent of patients responded to a single infusion of Tecartus, including 62 percent of patients achieving a complete response (CR). Among patients evaluable for safety, 18 percent experienced Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 37 percent experienced Grade 3 or higher neurologic toxicities.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200724005428/en/

“Despite promising advances, there are still major gaps in treatment for patients with MCL who progress following initial therapy,” said Michael Wang, MD, ZUMA-2 Lead Investigator and Professor, Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, Division of Cancer Medicine at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “Many patients have high-risk disease and are more likely to keep progressing, even after subsequent treatments. The availability of Tecartus as the first-ever cell therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory MCL provides an important option with a response rate of nearly 90 percent and early clinical evidence suggesting durable remissions in later lines of therapy.”

“Kite is committed to bringing the promise of CAR T therapy to patients with hematological cancers, and as such, we are proud to launch our second cell therapy,” said Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite. “I extend my thanks to the patient study participants, caregivers, clinical researchers, regulators and dedicated colleagues at Kite who helped make this approval possible, and we look forward to partnering with the lymphoma community to deliver this potentially transformative therapy to patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.”

Tecartus has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risks of CRS and neurologic toxicities. A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) has been approved by the FDA for Tecartus and has been combined with the Yescarta® (axicabtagene ciloleucel) REMS. The REMS program will inform and educate healthcare professionals about the risks associated with Tecartus therapy, and training and certification on the REMS program will be an integral part of the final authorization for centers offering Tecartus. Additional information about the REMS program can be found at www.YescartaTecartusREMS.com. Please see below for Important Safety Information.

MCL is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that arises from cells originating in the “mantle zone” of the lymph node and predominantly affects men over the age of 60. MCL is highly aggressive following relapse, with many patients progressing following therapy.

“This approval marks the first CAR T cell therapy approved for mantle cell lymphoma patients and represents a new frontier in the treatment of this disease,” said Meghan Gutierrez, Chief Executive Officer at the Lymphoma Research Foundation. “In the past decade, researchers have made significant progress in our understanding of this disease and we have seen an increase in clinical trials for patients, which we hope will continue to improve treatment strategies and the options available to people with mantle cell lymphoma. Today’s news builds upon this progress and provides hope to mantle cell patients and their loved ones.”

Tecartus will be manufactured in Kite’s commercial manufacturing facility in El Segundo, California. In the ZUMA-2 trial, Kite demonstrated a 96 percent manufacturing success rate and a median manufacturing turnaround time of 15 days from leukapheresis to product delivery. Manufacturing speed is especially critical for patients with advanced disease, who are very ill and at risk for quick progression.

Patients whose healthcare professionals have prescribed Tecartus therapy can work with Kite Konnect®, an integrated technology platform that provides information and assistance throughout the therapy process for Kite’s commercialized CAR T therapies, including courier tracking for shipments and manufacturing status updates. Kite Konnect provides support for eligible patients receiving Yescarta and Tecartus, and it provides information for the healthcare teams supporting their patients. Healthcare providers and patients can reach Kite Konnect at www.KiteKonnect.com or 1-844-454-KITE (1-844-454-5483).

KTE-X19 is currently under review in the European Union and has been granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency for relapsed or refractory MCL.

Tecartus Trial Results
The approval of Tecartus is supported by data from the ongoing, single arm, open-label ZUMA-2 pivotal trial. The study enrolled 74 adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL who had previously received anthracycline- or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti-CD20 antibody therapy and a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per the Lugano Classification (2014), defined as the combined rate of CR and partial responses as assessed by an Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRRC).

In the study, 87 percent of patients (n=60 evaluable for efficacy analysis) responded to a single infusion of Tecartus, including 62 percent of patients who achieved a CR. Among all patients, follow-up was at least six months after their first objective disease response. Median duration of response has not yet been reached.

In the trial, 18 percent of patients (n=82 evaluable for safety) experienced Grade 3 or higher CRS and 37 percent experienced neurologic events. The most common (≥ 10 percent) Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, hypophosphatemia, encephalopathy, leukopenia, hypoxia, pyrexia, hyponatremia, hypertension, infection-pathogen unspecified, pneumonia, hypocalcemia and lymphopenia. The FDA approved Tecartus with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). The Tecartus REMS has been combined with the Yescarta REMS and is now called the “Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) and Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel) REMS Program” (www.YescartaTecartusREMS.com).

About Tecartus
Tecartus is an autologous, anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy. Tecartus uses the XLP™ manufacturing process that includes T cell enrichment, a necessary step in certain B-cell malignancies in which circulating lymphoblasts are a common feature. In addition to MCL, Tecartus is also currently in Phase 1/2 trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The use of Tecartus in ALL and CLL is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been established in these cancer types.

Tecartus Indication
Tecartus is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME and NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Tecartus. Do not administer Tecartus to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.
Neurologic toxicities, including life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Tecartus, including concurrently with CRS or after CRS resolution. Monitor for neurologic toxicities after treatment with Tecartus. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.
Tecartus is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program.
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS),including life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with Tecartus. In ZUMA-2, CRS occurred in 91% (75/82) of patients receiving Tecartus, including ≥ Grade 3 CRS in 18% of patients. Among the patients who died after receiving Tecartus, one had a fatal CRS event. The median time to onset of CRS was three days (range: 1 to 13 days) and the median duration of CRS was ten days (range: 1 to 50 days). Among patients with CRS, key manifestations (>10%) included fever (99%), hypotension (60%), hypoxia (37%), chills (33%), tachycardia (37%), headache (24%), fatigue (19%), nausea (13%), alanine aminotransferase increased (13%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (12%), and diarrhea (11%). Serious events associated with CRS included hypotension, fever, hypoxia, acute kidney injury, and tachycardia.

Ensure that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available for each patient prior to infusion of Tecartus. Following infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS daily for at least seven days at the certified healthcare facility, and for four weeks thereafter. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated.

Neurologic Toxicities, including those that were life-threatening, occurred following treatment with Tecartus. In ZUMA-2, neurologic events occurred in 81% of patients, 37% of whom experienced Grade ≥3 adverse reactions. The median time to onset for neurologic events was six days (range: 1 to 32 days). Neurologic events resolved for 52 out of 66 (79%) patients with a median duration of 21 days (range: 2 to 454 days). Three patients had ongoing neurologic events at the time of death, including one patient with serious encephalopathy. The remaining unresolved neurologic events were either Grade 1 or Grade 2. Fifty-four (66%) patients experienced CRS by the onset of neurological events. Five (6%) patients did not experience CRS with neurologic events and eight patients (10%) developed neurological events after the resolution of CRS. 85% of all treated patients experienced the first CRS or neurological event within the first seven days after Tecartus infusion.

The most common neurologic events (>10%) included encephalopathy (51%), headache (35%), tremor (38%), aphasia (23%), and delirium (16%). Serious events including encephalopathy, aphasia, and seizures occurred.

Monitor patients daily for at least seven days at the certified healthcare facility and for four weeks following infusion for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities and treat promptly.

REMS Program: Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Tecartus is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program which requires that:

Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer Tecartus must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements. Certified healthcare facilities must have on-site, immediate access to tocilizumab, and ensure that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available for each patient for infusion within two hours after Tecartus infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS.
Certified healthcare facilities must ensure that healthcare providers who prescribe, dispense, or administer Tecartus are trained in the management of CRS and neurologic toxicities. Further information is available at www.YescartaTecartusREMS.com or 1-844-454-KITE (5483).
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or residual gentamicin in Tecartus.

Severe Infections: Severe or life-threatening infections occurred in patients after Tecartus infusion. In ZUMA-2, infections (all grades) occurred in 56% of patients. Grade 3 or higher infections, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, occurred in 30% of patients. Tecartus should not be administered to patients with clinically significant active systemic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to local guidelines.

Febrile neutropenia was observed in 6% of patients after Tecartus infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.

Viral Reactivation
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. Perform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

Prolonged Cytopenias: Patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Tecartus infusion. In ZUMA-2, Grade ≥3 cytopenias not resolved by Day 30 following Tecartus infusion occurred in 55% of patients and included thrombocytopenia (38%), neutropenia (37%), and anemia (17%). Monitor blood counts after infusion.

Hypogammaglobulinemia and B-cell aplasia can occur in patients receiving treatment with Tecartus. In ZUMA-2, hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 16% of patients. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with Tecartus and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following Tecartus treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least six weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with Tecartus.

Secondary Malignancies may develop. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that it occurs, contact Kite at 1-844-454-KITE (5483) to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.

Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following Tecartus infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this period.

Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) were pyrexia, CRS, hypotension, encephalopathy, fatigue, tachycardia, arrhythmia, infection – pathogen unspecified, chills, hypoxia, cough, tremor, musculoskeletal pain, headache, nausea, edema, motor dysfunction, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, dyspnea, rash, insomnia, pleural effusion, and aphasia. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 66% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (> 2%) were encephalopathy, pyrexia, infection – pathogen unspecified, CRS, hypoxia, aphasia, renal insufficiency, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, bacterial infections, dyspnea, fatigue, arrhythmia, tachycardia, and viral infections.

Agreement is valued at approximately $174 million through 2021 and brings the total AstraZeneca commitment to $261 million
Parties may enter into additional commercial manufacturing commitments as the candidate progresses over three years through Emergent’s flexible capacity deployment model
GAITHERSBURG, Md., July 27, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (NYSE:EBS) today announced that it has signed an agreement to provide contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services for large-scale commercial drug substance manufacturing for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, AZD1222. The agreement is valued at approximately $174 million through 2021 and follows an $87 million contract in June for development services, performance and process qualification, raw materials and an initial capacity reservation.

“Emergent is driven by our desire to advance solutions that will make an impact on this pandemic,” said Robert G. Kramer Sr., president and chief executive officer of Emergent BioSolutions. “Sharing a passion for science, we are encouraged by AstraZeneca’s investigational COVID-19 vaccine and look forward to supporting its continued progress.”

The adenovirus vector-based vaccine candidate, AZD1222, was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech, and licensed by AstraZeneca. The vaccine candidate is currently in clinical trials. It is one of the candidates funded and supported by Operation Warp Speed (OWS), the U.S. government’s program to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 medical countermeasures that aims to have substantial quantities of a safe and effective vaccine available.

Syed T. Husain, senior vice president and CDMO business unit head at Emergent, stated, “As COVID-19 vaccine candidates progress through the pipeline, Emergent stands ready alongside leading innovators to rapidly deploy our CDMO services to help meet the substantial demand for a vaccine – anchored on our foundational expertise in development and manufacturing and propelled by our commitment to our mission – to protect and enhance life.”

This agreement follows and is in addition to the landmark public-private CDMO partnership between Emergent and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) announced in June to pave the way for OWS high-priority innovators.

Activities under this agreement will be performed at Emergent’s Baltimore Bayview facility, where certain manufacturing capacity reserved by BARDA through the CDMO task order issued to Emergent under OWS will be used. Emergent’s Baltimore Bayview facility is a designated Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) designed for rapid manufacturing of large quantities of vaccines and treatments during public health emergencies.

The CIADM has unique capabilities across four independent suites to produce at clinical scale to get candidates rapidly into the clinic, while at the same time scaling up to enable large-scale manufacturing to up to 4000L to prepare for production of commercial volumes to meet customer demand. The CIADM has the capacity to produce tens to hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine on an annual basis, based upon the platform technology being used.

Financial Considerations
The company will provide an update to its 2020 financial outlook incorporating expectations related to this agreement and any other relevant information when it reports its second quarter financial results on July 30, 2020.

Emergent’s Response to COVID-19
Emergent BioSolutions is deploying its decades of experience in vaccine and hyperimmune development and manufacturing, as well as its molecule-to-market contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services to provide comprehensive medical countermeasure solutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using its established hyperimmune platforms, Emergent is developing two investigational plasma-based treatments – COVID-Human Immune Globulin (COVID-HIG) and COVID-Equine Immune Globulin (COVID-EIG). COVID-HIG is being developed as a human plasma-derived therapy candidate with $14.5 million in HHS funding and will be evaluated in two studies of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, for potential treatment of COVID-19 in severe hospitalized and high-risk patients. With $34.6 million in funding from the Department of Defense and in collaboration with the Mount Sinai Health System and ImmunoTek Bio Centers, COVID-HIG will also be evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis in populations at high risk of COVID-19, such as front-line health care workers and the military. COVID-EIG is being developed as an equine plasma-derived therapy candidate for potential treatment of severe disease in humans. Both candidates are anticipated to be in Phase 2 clinical studies in 2020. These investigational products are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and their safety and effectiveness have not been established.

Emergent is deploying its CDMO capabilities, capacities, and expertise to support the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed to pave the way for innovators to advance COVID-19 programs. The company is working with four innovators to develop and manufacture COVID-19 vaccine candidates. For the COVID-19 vaccine response, Emergent’s integrated CDMO network provides development services from its Gaithersburg facility, drug substance manufacturing at its Baltimore Bayview facility, and drug product manufacturing at its Baltimore Camden and Rockville facilities, all in Maryland.

For 22 years Emergent has focused on advancing public health, and its multi-pronged approach to tackling COVID-19 demonstrates its commitment to its mission – to protect and enhance life.

Vrinda,40702,AstraZeneca Report Results of Farxiga in P-III DAPA-CKD Study for Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease,Farxiga met all primary and secondary endpoints in groundbreaking Phase III DAPA-CKD trial for the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease,"The P-III DAPA-CKD involve assessing of Farxiga ((dapagliflozin, 10mg, qd) + SOC vs PBO in 4,304 patients with CKD Stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D
 The study met its 1EPs i.e. worsening of renal function or risk of death (defined as a composite of an eGFR decline ≥50%, the onset of ESKD and death from CV/ renal cause) and 2EPs i.e. time to first occurrence of the renal composite (sustained ≥50% eGFR decline, ESKD, and renal death
 Farxiga (PO, qd) is an SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monothx. and combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control, weight loss and BP reduction","This announcement contains inside information
28 July 2020 07:00 BST

Farxiga significantly reduced the worsening of renal function or risk of death in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type-2 diabetes
High-level results from Farxiga’s (dapagliflozin) Phase III DAPA-CKD trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on its primary endpoint of a composite of worsening of renal function or risk of death (defined as a composite endpoint of ≥50% sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), onset of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) or cardiovascular (CV) or renal death) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The trial also met all its secondary endpoints in CKD patients with and without type-2 diabetes (T2D), making Farxiga the first medicine to significantly reduce the risk of death from any cause in this patient population.

CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function affecting nearly 700 million people worldwide,1,2 many of them still undiagnosed.3,4 Currently there are limited treatment options for these patients.5 CKD is associated with significant patient morbidity and an increased risk of CV events,6 such as heart failure (HF) and premature death.7

The co-chairs of the trial and its Executive Committee Prof. David Wheeler, University College London, and Prof. Hiddo L. Heerspink, University Medical Center Groningen, said: “The DAPA-CKD trial has shown dapagliflozin’s potential as a long-awaited new treatment option for patients with chronic kidney disease. The data will be transformative for these patients.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “DAPA-CKD is the first trial to demonstrate overwhelming efficacy, including improvement on survival, in chronic kidney disease patients both with and without type-2 diabetes. We look forward to sharing these exciting Farxiga results with the scientific community and health authorities worldwide.”

The safety and tolerability profile for Farxiga was consistent with the well-established safety profile of the medicine.

The full DAPA-CKD trial results will be submitted for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.

In March 2020, AstraZeneca announced that the DAPA-CKD trial was being stopped early following a recommendation from an independent Data Monitoring Committee based on its determination of overwhelming efficacy.

Additionally, in May 2020, Farxiga was approved in the US to reduce the risk of CV death and hospitalisation for heart failure (hHF) in adults with HF (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with and without T2D. Farxiga is also under review with the European Medicines Agency, as well as in other regions, for the treatment of patients with HF.

Chronic kidney disease

CKD can be a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function (shown by reduced eGFR or markers of kidney damage, or both, for at least three months).1 The most common causes of CKD are diabetes, hypertension and glomerulonephritis.8 In its most severe form, known as ESKD, kidney damage and deterioration of kidney function have progressed to the stage where dialysis or kidney transplantation are required.9 The majority of patients with CKD will die from CV causes before reaching ESKD.10

DAPA-CKD

DAPA-CKD is an international, multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded trial in 4,304 patients designed to evaluate the efficacy of Farxiga 10mg, compared with placebo, in patients with CKD Stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D. Farxiga is given once daily in addition to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is worsening of renal function or risk of death (defined as a composite of an eGFR decline ≥50%, onset of ESKD and death from CV or renal cause). The secondary endpoints included the time to first occurrence of the renal composite (sustained ≥50% eGFR decline, ESKD and renal death), the composite of CV death or hHF, and death from any cause. The trial was conducted in 21 countries.

Farxiga

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction. In the DECLARE CV outcomes trial in adults with T2D, Farxiga reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of hospitalisation for HF or CV death versus placebo, when added to standard of care.

Farxiga is currently being tested for patients with HF in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) trials. Farxiga will also be tested in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking registry-based randomised controlled trial. Farxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

AstraZeneca in CVRM

Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism (CVRM) together forms one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company. By following the science to understand more clearly the underlying links between the heart, kidneys and pancreas, AstraZeneca is investing in a portfolio of medicines to protect organs and improve outcomes by slowing disease progression, reducing risks and tackling co-morbidities.

Zebra Medical’s algorithm empowers breast radiologists by prioritizing and identifying suspicious mammograms, providing a safety net for radiologists. The suspicious mammograms are identified faster and read earlier than the current “first-in first-out” standard of care.

“Zebra Medical Vision’s HealthMammo may help radiologists deal with the screening management strategy of the post COVID backlog and triaging.”

This is Zebra Medical Vision’s first solution for Oncology to receive FDA clearance, as part of the company’s AI1 “All-In-One” bundle. Zebra Medical is also the first startup to receive FDA clearances for AI based technology across three imaging modalities – CT, x-ray and mammography, providing coverage for roughly 80% of the total imaging volumes.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women, impacting 2.1 million women worldwide each year and causing the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women. It is estimated that 627,000 women died from breast cancer in 2018, approximately 15 percent of all cancer-related female deaths. While breast cancer rates are higher among women in more developed regions, rates are increasing in nearly every region globally1.

Zebra Medical’s HealthMammo solution is an automatic AI tool that indicates “suspicious” or “not suspicious” for every 2D mammography performed. The mammograms are automatically sent to Zebra Medical’s imaging analytics platform, where they are processed and analyzed for suspected breast lesions. The HealthMammo product then returns its result to the radiologist, either by signaling within the worklist or by notifying the user in a dedicated application.

The algorithm can be used in single reader paradigms, supporting triage and workflow improvement (as cleared by the FDA) or in double reading paradigms, already available outside of the US, supporting the second radiologists and reducing their workload.

Supporting early detection protocols, Zebra Medical Vision’s HealthMammo product helps health providers minimize the COVID-19-induced care gaps with an automated AI tool that can identify faster patients with suspicious lesions. According to the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Mammography Quality Standards program (MQSA), approximately 40 million mammograms are performed in the U.S. every year. With the outbreak of coronavirus, annual mammography tests during lockdown were postponed or canceled. As a result, providers are dealing with substantial growing backlogs, as 100,000 screens are added every day in the US alone2, in addition to a 94% drop in mammography imaging volumes during lockdown3. Patients are experiencing increasing anxiety waiting to be tested and run the risk of missing the early detection component of annual screening which could result in an undetected cancer that keeps growing.

“As restrictions are lifted from the COVID-19 crisis, the backlog of mammograms has increased,” says Dr. Michael Fishman, Breast Imaging Section Chief at Boston Medical Center (BMC), Massachusetts. “Zebra Medical Vision’s HealthMammo may help radiologists deal with the screening management strategy of the post COVID backlog and triaging.”

“Our work is twofold: supporting the medical team’s overload and ensuring the well-being of patients, by supporting early detection and reducing the anxiety surrounding uncertainty,” says Ohad Arazi, CEO of Zebra Medical Vision. “The fact that during initial testings we were able to identify 2 cases that were missed, and to have these women be recalled and diagnosed with cancer, shows the vast impact and potential contribution of AI in Oncology. With this fully commercial and regulated product, we aim to provide even more value and help patients and providers navigate the new COVID effected reality we are all facing. We’re proud of the achievements we’ve made in the past few months, providing U.S. healthcare with a growing portfolio of automatic solutions to enhance patient care, especially during these times.”

UCB will fund and perform a proof-of-concept study in AD and, upon availability of the results of that study, Genentech has the right to progress with the development or return full rights back to UCB. After Genentech’s decision to proceed with further clinical development, UCB will be eligible to receive further potential cost reimbursement, development and sales milestone payments as well as royalties with a total potential consideration approaching US $2 billion upon receipt of certain regulatory approvals and satisfying certain clinical and sales milestones.

This license agreement does not impact UCB’s 2020 financial outlook.

UCB continues to develop UCB0107 in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), with a confirmatory phase 3 study due to commence in Q2 2021.

About UCB0107

UCB0107 is a recombinant, humanized, full-length IgG4 monoclonal antibody, targeting a central Tau epitope, which is being developed to block/reduce the spread of Tau pathology.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein expressed in the central nervous system, which supports the assembly and stabilization of neuronal microtubules.[1] In tauopathies, Tau becomes pathogenic, forming tangles, which cause cell damage and ultimately neuronal death.[1.2.3] It is hypothesised that the spread of Tau protein from neuron to neuron underpins disease progression in tauopathies[4] providing the rationale for antibody therapies.

Forward looking statements UCB

This press release may contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “seeks”, “estimates”, “may”, “will”, “continue” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and beliefs of management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial information, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements of UCB, or industry results, to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19, changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’ efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also, UCB or others could discover safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover, sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, including pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally, a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of UCB’s data and systems.

Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market, or at any particular time, nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.

UCB is providing this information, including forward-looking statements, only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release, either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

 The vaccine is deploying Sanofi’s S-protein COVID-19 antigen together with GSK’s adjuvant technology. Both the companies are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant to produce up to 1B doses per year","Agreement relates to vaccine candidate using Sanofi’s recombinant protein-based technology combined with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system
Both companies are committed to making their COVID-19 vaccine candidate affordable and available globally
Ongoing discussions with the European Commission, with France and Italy on the negotiation team, and other governments to ensure global access to a novel coronavirus vaccine
PARIS and LONDON – July 29, 2020 – Sanofi and GSK have reached an agreement, subject to final contract, with the UK government for the supply of up to 60 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine candidate, developed by Sanofi in partnership with GSK, is based on the recombinant protein-based technology used by Sanofi to produce an influenza vaccine, and GSK’s established pandemic adjuvant technology.

“With our partner GSK, we are pleased to cooperate with the UK government as well as several other countries and global organizations as part of our ongoing efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine and make it available as quickly as possible. We greatly appreciate the UK government’s support of this shared vision,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur.

Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added, “We believe that this adjuvanted vaccine candidate has the potential to play a significant role in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic, both in the UK and around the world.  We thank the UK Government for confirmation of purchasing intent, which supports the significant investment we are already making as a company to scale up development and production of this vaccine.”

Sanofi is leading the clinical development and registration of the COVID-19 vaccine and expects a Phase 1/2 study to start in September, followed by a Phase 3 study by the end of 2020.  If the data are positive, regulatory approval could be achieved by the first half of 2021.  In parallel, Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant to produce up to one billion doses per year overall.

UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: “Our scientists and researchers are racing to find a safe and effective vaccine at a speed and scale never seen before. While this progress is truly remarkable, the fact remains that there are no guarantees.”

“In the meantime, it is important that we secure early access to a diverse range of promising vaccine candidates, like GSK and Sanofi, to increase our chances of finding one that works so we can protect the public and save lives.” 

Kate Bingham, Chair of the UK Government’s Vaccines Taskforce, said: “Through this agreement with GSK and Sanofi, the Vaccine Taskforce can add another type of vaccine to the three different types of vaccine we have already secured.  

“This diversity of vaccine types is important because we do not yet know which, if any, of the different types of vaccine will prove to generate a safe and protective response to COVID-19. Whilst this agreement is very good news, we mustn’t be complacent or over optimistic.” 

“The fact remains we may never get a vaccine and if we do get one, we have to be prepared that it may not be a vaccine which prevents getting the virus, but rather one that reduces symptoms.” 

Sanofi and GSK are committed to making the vaccine available globally

Active discussions on supply of the vaccine are ongoing with global organizations, the U.S. and the EU Commission, with France and Italy on the negotiation team. The partners  plan to provide a significant portion of total worldwide available supply capacity in 2021/22 to the global initiative, “Access to COVID‐19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator”, a global collaboration of leaders of governments, global health organizations, businesses and philanthropies to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

On the front lines in the fight against COVID-19

In addition to the recombinant protein-based vaccine in collaboration with GSK, Sanofi is also developing a messenger RNA vaccine candidate in partnership with Translate Bio. With several innovative vaccine platforms currently being investigated across the industry, mRNA is considered among the most promising. Sanofi expects a Phase 1 study to start by the end of the year, and, if the data are positive, an approval at the earliest in the second half of 2021​. Translate Bio has established mRNA manufacturing capacity and Sanofi expects to be able to supply annual capacity of 90 to 360 million doses.

 MK-6482 (formerly PT2977) is an investigational oral HIF-2α inhibitor, currently being evaluated in a P-III trial in advanced RCC (NCT04195750), a P-II trial in VHL-associated RCC (NCT03401788), and a P-I/II dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial in advanced solid tumors, including advanced RCC (NCT02974738)","Reinforces Important Progress in Merck’s Oncology Pipeline to Advance Novel Therapeutic Candidates

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to the hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2α) inhibitor MK-6482, a novel investigational candidate in Merck’s oncology pipeline, for the treatment of patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC)with nonmetastatic RCC tumors less than three centimeters in size, unless immediate surgery is required. The FDA also granted orphan drug designation to MK-6482 for VHL disease. These designations are based on data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating MK-6482 in patients with VHL-associated clear cell RCC, which were presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.

“Merck’s diverse and expansive oncology pipeline is focused on bringing forward innovative new treatments to patients in need and continues to show important progress,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “These designations for MK-6482 support the potential of targeting HIF-2α in certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease, who currently have limited treatment options and face an increased risk for benign tumors as well as several types of cancer, including renal cell carcinoma.”

The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation is granted to expedite the development and review of medicines that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that have demonstrated preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the medicine may provide a substantial improvement over available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint. The FDA’s orphan drug designation is granted to medicines that are intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.

About MK-6482

MK-6482 (formerly PT2977) is an investigational, novel, potent, selective, oral HIF-2α inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 trial in advanced RCC (NCT04195750), a Phase 2 trial in VHL-associated RCC (NCT03401788), and a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial in advanced solid tumors, including advanced RCC (NCT02974738). Proteins known as hypoxia-inducible factors, including HIF-2α, can accumulate in patients when VHL, a tumor-suppressor protein, is inactivated. The accumulation of HIF-2α can lead to the formation of both benign and malignant tumors. This inactivation of VHL has been observed in more than 90% of ccRCC tumors. Research into VHL biology that led to the discovery of HIF-2α was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2019.

About Von Hippel-Lindau Disease and Renal Cell Carcinoma

Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare genetic disease that affects one in 36,000 people (200,000 cases worldwide and 10,000 cases in the U.S. alone). Patients with VHL disease are at risk for benign blood vessel tumors as well as several cancers, including RCC. As many as 60% of people with VHL disease develop RCC, which is a leading cause of death for patients with VHL disease.

Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine of 10 kidney cancers are RCCs, and about seven of 10 RCCs are clear cell. Worldwide, it is estimated there were about 403,000 cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and about 175,000 deaths from the disease in 2018. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated there will be nearly 74,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and almost 15,000 deaths from the disease in 2020.

Merck’s Focus on Cancer

Our goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At Merck, the potential to bring new hope to people with cancer drives our purpose and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment.

Vrinda,40708,Roche's Tecentriq + Cotellic and Zelboraf Receives the US FDA's Approval for Patients with Advanced Melanoma,FDA approves Roche’s Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf for people with advanced melanoma,"The approval is based on P-III IMspire150 study assessing Tecentriq (atezolizumab) + Cotellic (cobimetinib) + Zelboraf (vemurafenib) vs PBO + Cotellic + Zelboraf in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma
 Results: mPFS (15.1 vs 10.6mos.); the safety profile of the Tecentriq combination was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines. The review was conducted under Project Orbis
 Tecentriq is a mAb targeting PD-L1, acts by blocking is its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptor. Cotellic is a MEK1/2 inhibitor in a cell signaling pathway that helps control cell growth and survival while Zelboraf is a prescription medicine for melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery and has a BRAF V600 mutation","Basel, 31 July 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) plus Cotellic® (cobimetinib) and Zelboraf® (vemurafenib) for the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma patients.  The safety profile observed in the Tecentriq combination was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines.

The supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Tecentriq was granted under priority review.  The review was also conducted under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners.

“When receiving a cancer immunotherapy combined with targeted therapies, patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma were able to live for more than 15 months without their disease worsening,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Genentech’s chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “Today’s FDA approval of this Tecentriq combination represents an important step forward for many patients living with advanced melanoma.”

The approval is based on results from the Phase III IMspire150 study, in which the addition of Tecentriq to Cotellic and Zelboraf helped people live longer without disease worsening or death compared to placebo plus Cotellic and Zelboraf (median PFS 15.1 months versus 10.6 months respectively; hazard ratio, HR=0.78; confidence interval: 0.63-0.97; P=0.025).  The most common adverse reactions (rate ≥20%) in patients who received Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf were rash (75%), musculoskeletal pain (62%), fatigue (51%), hepatotoxicity (50%), pyrexia (49%), nausea (30%), pruritus (26%), edema (26%), stomatitis (23%), hypothyroidism (22%), and photosensitivity reaction (21%).

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMspire150 study
IMspire150 is a Phase III, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study in people with previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. The study compared the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf to the combination of placebo plus Cotellic and Zelboraf. The primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed PFS. Key secondary endpoints include PFS by an independent review committee, overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response and other safety and pharmacokinetic measures.

Five hundred and fourteen adult patients took part in the study. Randomisation was stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and geographic region. Eligible patients were randomised 1:1 to one of two treatment groups, to receive 28-day cycles of either: Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf (the Tecentriq group) or Placebo plus Cotellic and Zelboraf (the control group). In cycle 1, all patients received once-daily oral Cotellic 60 mg plus twice-daily oral Zelboraf 960 mg for 21 days followed by twice-daily Zelboraf 720 mg or 960 mg for 7 days in the Tecentriq group or control group, respectively. Patients in the Tecentriq group received Zelboraf 720 mg Days 1–28 of each subsequent cycle. The lower 720 mg dose of Zelboraf in the Tecentriq group was a safety measure to mitigate the risk of overlapping toxicities, while ensuring an efficacious dose of Zelboraf. Treatment was continued until investigator-determined disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, patient or physician decision to withdraw, whichever occurred first.

About advanced melanoma
Melanoma is a less common, but more aggressive and potentially deadly form of skin cancer.1,2 When melanoma is diagnosed early, it is generally a curable disease,3,4 but most people with advanced melanoma have a poor prognosis.2 More than 287,000 people worldwide are currently diagnosed with melanoma each year.5 BRAF is mutated in approximately half of melanomas.6 In recent years, there have been significant advances in treatment for advanced melanoma and people with the disease have more options. However, it continues to be a serious health issue with a high medical need and a steadily increasing incidence over the past 30 years.7

About Tecentriq (atezolizumab)
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1. Tecentriq is designed to bind to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the re-activation of T cells. Tecentriq may also affect normal cells.

About Cotellic (cobimetinib)
Cotellic is designed to inhibit MEK1/2, proteins in a cell signaling pathway that helps control cell growth and survival. Cotellic, when used in combination with Zelboraf, is approved in the United States and Europe, as well as many countries around the world, for the treatment of people with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery and has a BRAF V600 mutation. Cotellic was discovered by Exelixis and is being developed by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in collaboration with Exelixis.

About Zelboraf (vemurafenib)
Zelboraf is a prescription medicine for the treatment of people with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery and has a BRAF V600 mutation. Zelboraf is designed to inhibit some mutated forms of BRAF, which cause abnormal signaling inside cancer cells leading to tumor growth. BRAF is a protein in a cell signaling pathway that helps control cell growth and survival. Zelboraf was the first approved product in its class. Zelboraf was co-developed under a 2006 license and collaboration agreement between Roche and Plexxikon Inc., the small molecule structure-guided R&D center of the Daiichi Sankyo Group.

 The 1EPs of the study include OS, EFS, CR and transfusion independence, and AE profile. The designation addresses the needs of people living with HR-MDS, for whom few therapies exist, and the benefits are limited
 Pevonedistat is a first in class NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor. The pre-clinical studies demonstrated the inhibition of NAE, blocked the modification of select proteins, which resulted in the disruption of cell cycle progression and cell survival, leading to cancer cell death","– Designation Based on Phase 2 Data and Reinforces Significant Treatment Need for HR-MDS 

– Pevonedistat Could be First Novel Treatment Option for HR-MDS in More Than a Decade 

 

Cambridge, Mass. and Osaka, Japan, July 30, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for its investigational drug pevonedistat for the treatment of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS). Pevonedistat, a first in class NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, could be the first novel treatment for HR-MDS patients in more than a decade, expanding treatment options that have so far been limited to hypomethylating agent (HMA) monotherapy alone. Even with current treatment options, outcomes for people living with HR-MDS remain poor.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based on the final analysis of the Pevonedistat-2001 Phase 2 study, which evaluated pevonedistat plus azacitidine versus azacitidine alone in patients with rare leukemias, including HR-MDS. The FDA considered a number of endpoints, including overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), complete remission (CR) and transfusion independence, as well as the adverse event profile. This designation signals a potential advancement in addressing the needs of people living with HR-MDS, for whom few therapies exist and the benefits are limited.

“Higher-risk MDS is associated with poor prognosis, diminished quality of life and a higher chance of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, another aggressive cancer. The combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine is a promising therapeutic approach with the potential to be the first novel treatment advancement for higher-risk MDS in more than 10 years,” said Christopher Arendt, Head, Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “We thank the FDA for recognizing pevonedistat, and the urgency to develop innovative therapies that address critical treatment needs for higher-risk MDS, a patient population with few options.”

Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. FDA is granted to accelerate the development and regulatory review of investigational drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening ailments. Agents with this designation have shown preliminary clinical evidence that indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.

Takeda presented results of the Pevonedistat-2001 trial during oral sessions at the virtual 56th American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and virtual 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress.

 

About Pevonedistat
Pevonedistat is a first in class NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor. In pre-clinical studies, the inhibition of NAE by pevonedistat blocked the modification of select proteins, which resulted in disruption of cell cycle progression and cell survival, leading to cancer cell death. Pevonedistat in combination with azacitidine demonstrated promising clinical activity in a Phase 2 study of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS), higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (HR-CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a Phase 1 study of patients with AML. Pevonedistat is currently being evaluated in Phase 3 studies as a first-line treatment for patients with HR-MDS, HR-CMML and AML, who are ineligible (unfit) for transplant or intensive induction chemotherapy, and in a Phase 2 study in unfit AML in a triple combination with azacitidine and venetoclax. Pevonedistat is an investigational drug for which safety and efficacy have not been established.

About MDS
MDS is a rare form of bone marrow-related cancer caused by irregular blood cell production within the bone marrow. This cancer most commonly affects older patients, with the median age of diagnosis ranging from 60 to 74 years. As a result of this irregular production, a person with MDS does not have enough normal red blood cells, white blood cells and/or platelets in circulation. Symptoms for MDS are often vague and related to low blood counts, and may include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising or bleeding, loss of appetite, weakness, pale skin, fever and frequent or severe infections.

There are several classifications of MDS – very low-risk to very high-risk – determined by blood counts, blast counts, mutations and cytogenetics. Higher-risk disease is defined as intermediate, high or very high risk on the International Prognostic Scoring System – Revised (IPSS-R), and these patients have a poorer prognosis. Approximately 40% of patients with HR-MDS transform to AML, another aggressive cancer with poor outcomes.

About Herceptin (trastuzumab)
Herceptin® is a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target and block the function of the HER2 receptor, a protein found on the outside of many normal cells and in high quantities on the outside of cancer cells in HER2-positive cancers. Herceptin binds to a specific section of the HER2 protein, inhibiting the signals it sends that encourage tumour cell growth, while also calling on the body’s immune system to attack the cancer cells.

Since it was first approved in 1998, Herceptin has been used to treat over two million patients worldwide, diagnosed with HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. It has also become the backbone of other innovative treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer, which have continued to improve the outcomes of patients with this otherwise aggressive disease. In addition to the standard intravenous formulation, Herceptin is available in a subcutaneous (SC) formulation which was first approved in 2013. Herceptin SC represents a significant step forward in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer as it offers patients a faster, more convenient and less painful way to receive treatment with Herceptin.

Vrinda,40711,Sanofi and GSK Receive $2.1B from the US Government to Supply 100M Doses of COVID-19 Vaccine,Sanofi and GSK in advanced discussions with European Union to supply up to 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine,"The US government will provide ~$2.1B to support the development of the vaccine, including clinical trials with some amount to be used for ramping up the manufacturing and delivery of an initial 100M dose of the vaccine
 The US government has an option to supply an additional 500M dose and helps the government’s Operation Warp Speed goals for providing millions of doses of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine
 Additionally, the companies are in discussion with the EC for the supply of up to 300M doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Both the companies are committed to making their COVID-19 vaccine affordable and available globally","Issued: London, UK and Paris, France

Discussions relate to vaccine candidate using Sanofi’s recombinant protein-based technology combined with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system
Both companies are committed to making their COVID-19 vaccine affordable and available globally
Sanofi and GSK are in advanced discussions with the European Commission (EC) for the supply of up to 300 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine candidate developed by Sanofi in partnership with GSK, is based on the recombinant protein-based technology used by Sanofi to produce an influenza vaccine, and GSK’s established adjuvant technology. The doses would be manufactured in European countries including France, Belgium, Germany and Italy. This marks a key milestone in protecting and serving the European population against COVID-19.

“Today’s announcement helps to ensure that millions of Europeans will have access to a potential vaccine protecting against COVID-19, once proven safe and effective. It has been our steadfast commitment to provide a vaccine that is affordable and accessible to everyone, and we are grateful to the European Commission for their ongoing engagement and shared support of this effort,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur. “Together with GSK, we are working relentlessly to develop and produce a vaccine to address this global health crisis.”

Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added “GSK is proud to be working in partnership with Sanofi to make this vaccine available as soon as possible in Europe. Both companies have significant R&D and manufacturing capability in Europe and are already working hard to scale up production across our networks. This announcement from the EC supports our ongoing efforts.”

Sanofi is leading the clinical development and registration of the COVID-19 vaccine and expects a Phase 1/ 2 study to start in September, followed by a Phase 3 study by the end of 2020. If data are positive, regulatory approval could be achieved by the first half of 2021. In parallel, Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant to produce up to one billion doses per year overall.

Sanofi and GSK are committed to making the vaccine available globally
Sanofi and GSK recently signed agreements with the United States where they have a longstanding partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and also with the UK Government. The partners plan to provide a significant portion of total worldwide available supply capacity in 2021/22 to the global initiative “Access to COVID‐19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator,” a global collaboration of leaders of governments, global health organizations, businesses and philanthropies to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

GSK commitment to tackling COVID-19
GSK is collaborating with companies and research groups across the world working on promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates through the use of our innovative vaccine adjuvant technology. The use of an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protecting more people. GSK does not expect to profit from COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic phase, and will invest any short-term profit in coronavirus related research and long-term pandemic preparedness, either through GSK internal investments or with external partners.

About GSK
GSK is a science-led global healthcare company with a special purpose: to help people do more, feel better, live longer. For further information please visit www.gsk.com/about-us.

 The company will enroll up to ~2400 patients and test whether a single dose of LY-CoV555 reduces the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection @4wks. as well as complications of COVID-19 @8wks.
 LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 mAb, directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The therapy emerges from the collaboration b/w Lilly and AbCellera to create Ab therapies for the prevention & treatment of COVID-19","– More than 40 percent of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. linked to long-term care facilities; urgent need for therapeutic strategies to prevent COVID-19 in this vulnerable population – First-of-its-kind study will enroll up to 2,400 residents and staff at long-term care facilities; will utilize customized mobile research units to conduct the study on-site

INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced the initiation of BLAZE-2, a Phase 3 trial studying LY-CoV555 for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities in the U.S. (skilled nursing facilities, commonly referred to as nursing homes, and assisted living facilities). LY-CoV555, the lead antibody from Lilly’s collaboration with AbCellera, is a neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 among residents of long-term care facilities combined with the higher mortality rate for the elderly creates the urgent need for therapies to prevent COVID-19 in this vulnerable population.

“COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on nursing home residents. We’re working as fast as we can to create medicines that might stop the spread of the virus to these vulnerable individuals. While it’s not easy to conduct clinical trials in this setting, we’re taking on the challenge in an effort to help those who need us the most,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “We are grateful to the NIAID team for their exceptional partnership on this innovative trial and we are deeply appreciative of the care facilities, their staff and the many residents who will be participating in this important study.”

The Lilly-sponsored BLAZE-2 study is a first-of-its-kind COVID-19 trial and is being conducted in partnership with NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), along with the COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) and several long-term care facility networks across the country. The study will enroll residents and staff who live or work at facilities that have had a recently diagnosed case of COVID-19 and who are now at a high risk of exposure. It will evaluate the efficacy and safety of LY-CoV555 for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, testing whether a single dose of LY-CoV555 reduces the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 4 weeks, as well as complications of COVID-19 through 8 weeks. It is expected to enroll up to 2,400 participants.

“The mission of the COVID-19 Prevention Network is to conduct Phase 3 vaccine and monoclonal antibody efficacy studies for the prevention of COVID-19,” said Myron Cohen, M.D., director of UNC’s Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases and a CoVPN leader. “We’re excited to partner with Lilly to determine whether LY-CoV555 can prevent or mitigate progression of COVID-19 infection in this vulnerable population that has been greatly impacted by this virus.”

To address the challenging aspects of running a clinical trial in a long-term care facility during a pandemic, Lilly created customized mobile research units to support the on-site study. These units include a custom retrofitted recreational vehicle (RV) to support mobile labs and clinical trial material preparation, along with a trailer truck that will deliver all clinical trial supplies needed to create an on-site infusion clinic. To further minimize the burden on these facilities that normally do not conduct clinical trials, additional staff will be at the facilities to assist with the operations of the study. Lilly will deploy its mobile research unit fleet in response to outbreaks of the virus at long-term care facilities across the U.S.

“We commend Lilly and NIH in recognizing the critical need for developing medicines to combat the spread of the virus among some of the most vulnerable populations,” said Dr. Alexander Stemer, a board certified infectious disease expert and co-chair of Symphony Care Network’s COVID-19 task force. “As the scientific community searches for safe and effective therapies for COVID-19, we are proud to participate in this leading-edge study given its potential to save lives.”

Clinical investigators, hospitals or clinical sites interested in participating in one of Lilly’s clinical trials for a potential COVID-19 treatment should call 1-877-CT-LILLY (1-877-285-4559) or email covid19potentialsite@lilly.com. Patients interested in participating in one of Lilly’s clinical trials for a potential COVID-19 treatment should visit Lilly TrialGuide for information regarding eligibility for ongoing trials.

About LY-CoV555
LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. LY-CoV555 emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and tested by the scientists at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed dosing of LY-CoV555 in a Phase 1 study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628) and long-term follow-up is ongoing. BLAZE-1, a Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (NCT04427501), is ongoing.  Based on current trends, enrollment is estimated to be completed in September, with initial data readout soon thereafter followed by full data in Q4. LY-CoV555 has been well tolerated at all doses tested and no drug-related severe adverse events (SAEs) have been observed to date. Efficacy data are not yet available.

Lilly is committed to the rapid release of important scientific data. Large-scale manufacturing of this potential therapy continues, with the goal of having more than one hundred thousand doses available by the end of the year should LY-CoV555 prove to be a meaningful therapeutic option for COVID-19.

Vrinda,40715,"Janssen's Darzalex (daratumumab, SC) Receives Health Canada Approval for the Treatment of Patients with Multiple Myeloma","Janssen Announces Health Canada Approval of DARZALEX SC, a New Subcutaneous Formulation for the Treatment of Patients with Multiple Myeloma","The Health Canada has approved Darzalex SC (daratumumab) in four regimens across five indications in patients with MM, notably newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible patients as well as relapsed/refractory patients
 The approval is based on P-III COLUMBA and P-II PLEIADES studies. The P-III study demonstrated a consistent ORR (41% vs 37%), with PK & safety profile compared with Darzalex IV in patients with RRMS, 2/3rd reduction in systemic ARRs (13% vs 34%)
 In P-II PLEIADES study evaluates Darzalex SC + D-VMP in newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible patients & Darzalex SC + (D-Rd) in R/R patients prior treated with 1L therapy. In general, Darzalex SC reduces administration time from hours to minutes and demonstrates consistent efficacy with a reduction in administration-related reactions","DARZALEX® SC reduces administration time from hours to minutes and demonstrates consistent efficacy with a reduction in administration-related reactions compared to intravenous DARZALEX® (daratumumab)

TORONTO, Aug. 4, 2020 /CNW/ – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that Health Canada has approved DARZALEX® SC (daratumumab), a new subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab.1 DARZALEX® SC is approved in four regimens across five indications in patients with multiple myeloma, most notably newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible patients as well as relapsed or refractory patients. As a fixed-dose formulation, DARZALEX® SC can be administered over approximately three to five minutes, significantly less time than intravenous (IV) DARZALEX®, which is administered over hours.2 DARZALEX® SC is the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved in the treatment of multiple myeloma.

In the Phase 3 COLUMBA study published in The Lancet, DARZALEX® SC demonstrated a consistent overall response rate (ORR) and pharmacokinetics and a similar safety profile compared with IV DARZALEX® in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In addition, there was a nearly two-thirds reduction in systemic administration-related reactions (ARRs) for DARZALEX® SC compared to IV DARZALEX® (13 per cent vs. 34 per cent, respectively).3

“DARZALEX® has become a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma, supported by a robust body of evidence in both the frontline and relapsed and refractory settings,” says Dr. Darrell White, Hematologist, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax. “With this new subcutaneous formulation, not only is treatment much more convenient for patients, but it will also play a very important role in reducing wait times and the burden on our busy healthcare system, especially during this time.”

The approval is based on data from the Phase 3 COLUMBA and Phase 2 PLEIADES studies.4,5 In the COLUMBA study, the ORR was non-inferior for patients taking DARZALEX® SC as monotherapy compared to those taking IV DARZALEX® as monotherapy (41 per cent vs. 37 per cent, respectively). 6 Additionally, in the Phase 2 PLEIADES study evaluating the efficacy and safety of DARZALEX® SC in combination therapies, objective responses were demonstrated in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP) in newly diagnosed transplant ineligible patients. In addition, objective responses were demonstrated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd) in relapsed or refractory patients who received one prior line of therapy.7 In a pooled safety population of 490 patients who received DARZALEX® SC as monotherapy or in combination, the ARR rate was 11 per cent.8

DARZALEX® SC is approved in all current IV indications including (1) in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, (2) in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy, (3) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy, and (4) as monotherapy, in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.9

Active discussions are ongoing with public insurers to determine how DARZALEX® SC can be made accessible for both relapsed or refractory patients as well as newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible patients.

“This approval exemplifies Janssen’s mission and commitment to bringing together passion, science and ingenuity to advance novel solutions for patients,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC.

About the COLUMBA Study
The randomised, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 COLUMBA study included 522 patients (median age of 67 years) with multiple myeloma who had received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), or whose disease was refractory to both a PI and an ImiD. In the arm that received DARZALEX® SC (n=263), patients received a fixed dose of DARZALEX® SC 1,800 milligrams (mg), co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) 2,000 Units per milliliter (U/mL), subcutaneously weekly for Cycles 1 – 2, every two weeks for Cycles 3 – 6 and every four weeks for Cycle 7 and thereafter. In the IV DARZALEX® arm (n=259), patients received DARZALEX® for IV infusion 16 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) weekly for Cycles 1 – 2, every two weeks for Cycles 3 – 6 and every four weeks for Cycle 7 and thereafter. Each cycle was 28 days. In the arm that received DARZALEX® SC, it was given in a fixed volume of 15 mL over three to five minutes; the median injection time was five minutes. In the arm that received the IV administration, the median durations of the first, second and subsequent IV DARZALEX® infusions were 7.0, 4.3 and 3.4 hours, respectively. Patients in both arms continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.10,11

About the PLEIADES Study
The non-randomised, open-label, parallel assignment Phase 2 PLEIADES study included adults with multiple myeloma, including 67 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were treated with 1,800 mg of DARZALEX® SC in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) and 65 patients with relapsed or refractory disease who were treated with 1,800 mg of DARZALEX® SC plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd). The primary endpoint for the D-VMP and D- Rd cohorts was overall response rate.12

About DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC
DARZALEX® is the first CD38-directed monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved to treat multiple myeloma and in 2020, DARZALEX® SC (daratumumab) follows as the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved to treat patients with multiple myeloma.13 It binds to CD38, a surface protein highly expressed across multiple myeloma cells.14 DARZALEX® induces tumor cell death through cell lysis via multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).15  DARZALEX® has also demonstrated immunomodulatory effects such as increasing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells counts, which may contribute to clinical response.16

In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize DARZALEX®. Janssen Inc. commercializes DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC in Canada. For full Prescribing Information and more information about DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC, please visit www.janssen.com/canada.

About Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.17 When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow. In 2020, it is estimated that 3,400 Canadians will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma and there will be 1,600 deaths associated with the disease.18 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms in the early stages, patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone disease or pain, anemia, calcium elevation, and kidney problems.19

August 04, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
OAKLAND, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Eko today announced a global collaboration with AstraZeneca to accelerate the development of digital health tools for the earlier screening of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure.

“Eko’s collaboration with AstraZeneca will allow us to expand the capability of our technology, generate real-world data, and explore disease management solutions while leveraging AstraZeneca’s global expertise and existing relationships across the treatment continuum for heart failure.”

Through the collaboration, AstraZeneca and Eko will explore accelerating the development of Eko algorithms, enhancing clinical trials with Eko technology and potentially building new heart failure detection solutions.

Heart failure is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, affecting approximately 64 million people worldwide. Heart failure happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood into the body and is most commonly detected by echocardiogram imaging tests that are not normally conducted during a physical exam. Because of the limited access to echocardiography or other diagnostic tests, heart failure is frequently diagnosed late, making life-prolonging treatment more challenging. Heart failure remains as fatal as some of the most common cancers and is the leading cause of hospitalization for those over the age of 65, representing a significant clinical and economic burden.

Joris Silon, Senior Vice President, Cardiovascular Renal and Metabolism, AstraZeneca, said, “There are millions of people living with or at risk for heart failure. AstraZeneca’s collaboration with Eko will tap into cutting-edge digital health technologies that could allow us to harness the potential to improve access to individualized care and generate better patient outcomes.”

Over the past year, Eko has made significant advances in improving the detection of heart failure at the point of care. In December 2019, Eko announced FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for a novel ECG-based algorithm that can identify reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), a measure commonly used to diagnose patients with heart failure. This algorithm, when cleared by the FDA, will be compatible with the DUO, Eko’s handheld stethoscope and ECG device. By leveraging artificial intelligence, everyday in-office exams can be turned into a powerful, accessible screening tool.

“Eko was founded to provide a better way to understand our heart and lung health and to improve cardiopulmonary care for patients through digital technology and novel algorithms,” said Connor Landgraf, CEO and co-founder of Eko. “Eko’s collaboration with AstraZeneca will allow us to expand the capability of our technology, generate real-world data, and explore disease management solutions while leveraging AstraZeneca’s global expertise and existing relationships across the treatment continuum for heart failure.”

About Eko

Eko is elevating the way clinicians detect and monitor cardiac and respiratory disease by bringing together advanced sensors, patient and provider software, and AI-powered analysis. Its FDA cleared platform is used by tens of thousands of clinicians treating millions of patients around the world, in-person, and through telehealth. The company is headquartered in Oakland, California and privately-held, with investments from ARTIS Ventures, NTT Venture Capital, DigiTx Ventures, Mayo Clinic, Sutter Health and others.

Vrinda,40721,Novartis Reports Results of Ofatumumab (OMB157) in P-III ASCLEPIOS Trials for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,Novartis announces NEJM publication of Phase III ASCLEPIOS trials demonstrating superior efficacy of ofatumumab in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis,"The two P-III studies, ASCLEPIOS I & II involves assessing of ofatumumab (20mg, monthly SC) vs teriflunomide (14mg) in 1882 patients aged 18-55yrs with MS and EDDS score b/w 0 and 5.5. The studies were conducted across 37 countries in 350+ sites 
 Results of ASCLEPIOS I & II: 51% & 58% reduction in ARR (0.11 vs 0.22 & 0.10 vs 0.25); reduction Gd+T1 lesions (97% & 94%); reduction in new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% & 85%); superior in reducing neuroaxonal damage in both studies, as measured by NfL serum concentrations; 34% and 32% risk reduction in 3mos. and 6mos. CDW; favorable trend in rate of 6mos. CDI; no difference in annual rate of brain volume loss
 Ofatumumab (SC, once monthly) is a CD20 mAb, targeting CD20 molecule on the B-cell surface and inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion with its anticipated US FDA’s approval in Sept’20 and in EU by Q2’21","Ofatumumab is a targeted B-cell therapy that delivers superior efficacy with a similar safety profile when compared with teriflunomide, a commonly prescribed oral treatment for multiple sclerosis1
ASCLEPIOS I and II demonstrated significant reductions in risk of relapses, confirmed disability worsening and profound reduction of active or new brain lesions1
The US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency are currently reviewing ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in adults
If approved, ofatumumab will be the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home and has the potential to become a first-choice treatment for use in RMS patients 
Basel, August 5, 2020 — Novartis today announced that The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published the positive results from the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab (OMB157) 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). Both studies met the primary endpoints where ofatumumab showed a significant reduction in the number of confirmed relapses, evaluated as the annualized relapse rate (ARR)1.

“ASCLEPIOS I and II demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab and its potential to become a first-choice treatment option that offers RMS patients the flexibility as they continue to live their lives,” said Krishnan Ramanathan, Neuroscience Global Program Head at Novartis. “Ofatumumab is a testament to our commitment to advance science and investigate potential treatments that reimagine care and address significant unmet needs at all parts of the RMS journey.”

Results from the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies showed that compared with teriflunomide, ofatumumab:

Significantly reduced the ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 58% (0.10 vs 0.25) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (P<.001 in both studies) (primary endpoints)1
Showed a relative risk reduction of 34% (P=.002) in 3-month confirmed disability worsening (CDW) and 32% (P=.01) in 6-month CDW in a pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS (disability-related secondary endpoints)1
Showed significant reduction of both gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) T1 lesions with a 97% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, (both P<.001), and an 82% and 85% relative reduction in new or enlarging T2 lesions in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (both P<.001) (MRI-related secondary endpoints)1
Showed superiority in reducing neuroaxonal damage in both studies, as measured by neurofilament light chain (NfL) serum concentrations (biomarker secondary endpoint)1; axonal loss, which begins at disease onset, is a detrimental consequence of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and is a major determinant of irreversible neurological disability in MS patients2
Demonstrated a favorable trend in rate of 6-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI) events but did not reach significance (disability-related secondary endpoint)1
Showed the annual rate of brain volume loss was not significantly different (MRI-related secondary endpoint)1
Demonstrated an overall safety profile similar to teriflunomide, the frequency of serious infections and neoplasms was similar across both treatment groups. Injection-related reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache, injection-site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were the most commonly observed adverse events across both treatment groups, occurring in ≥10% of patients1,3
“The ASCLEPIOS studies found that ofatumumab produced a significant reduction in new inflammation, as well as fewer clinical relapses and progression events,” said Professor Stephen L. Hauser, Director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and co-chair of the steering committee for the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies. “A separate post hoc analysis demonstrated that nearly 9 out of 10 patients experienced no evidence of disease activity in the second year of treatment4. Ofatumumab represents a potential new option for RMS patients with greater efficacy compared to teriflunomide, a comparable safety profile, and the convenience of once monthly self-administration without the need for infusions.”

These data were published in the August 6, 2020 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

In February, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted the company’s Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), respectively, for ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adults. If approved, ofatumumab will be the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home and has the potential to become a first-choice treatment for use in RMS patients.

Regulatory approval for ofatumumab in the US is expected in September 2020 and in Europe by Q2 2021. Novartis is committed to bringing ofatumumab to patients worldwide and additional regulatory filings are currently underway.

About ofatumumab
Ofatumumab (OMB157) is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in development for RMS that is self-administered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously1,3. As shown in preclinical studies, ofatumumab is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion5. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and preclinical studies have shown that it may preserve the B-cells in the spleen6. Once-monthly dosing of ofatumumab also allows faster repletion of B-cells and offers flexibility7. Ofatumumab was originally developed by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 20158.

About ASCLEPIOS I and II studies
The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies are twin, identical design, flexible duration (up to 30 months), double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with RMS. The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies enrolled 1882 patients with MS, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.51. The studies were conducted in over 350 sites in 37 countries9. Ofatumumab demonstrated a significant reduction in ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 58% (0.10 vs 0.25) compared with teriflunomide (P<.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (primary endpoint). Ofatumumab also showed a relative risk reduction of 34% (P=.002) in 3-month CDW and 32% (P=.01) in 6-month CDW compared with teriflunomide in a pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS1.

Ofatumumab showed significant reduction of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions. It significantly reduced the mean number of both Gd+ T1 lesions (97% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) and new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% and 85% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) vs teriflunomide1. Ofatumumab demonstrated that it lowered NfL levels in serum at the first assessment at Month 3 compared with teriflunomide. There was no difference in slope of brain volume change from baseline between treatments. In a measure of 6-month CDI events, a favorable trend for ofatumumab was seen but this did not reach significance vs teriflunomide1.

Ofatumumab had a similar safety profile to teriflunomide, with the frequency of serious infections and neoplasms also being similar across both treatment groups1. Injection-related reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache, injection-site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were the most commonly observed adverse events across both treatment groups, occurring in ≥10% of patients1.

Overall, ofatumumab, a fully-human antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered superior efficacy and demonstrated a safety profile with infection rates similar to teriflunomide1.

About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord10. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide11, can be characterized into four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS)12. The various forms of MS can be distinguished based on whether a patient experiences relapses (clearly defined acute inflammatory attacks of worsening neurological function), and/or whether they experience progression of neurologic damage and disability from the onset of the disease10.

Denali to receive a $560 million upfront payment, a $465 million equity investment and potential milestone payments, profit sharing and royalties
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Aug. 06, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Denali Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: DNLI) today announced that they have signed a binding agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Denali’s small molecule inhibitors of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) for Parkinson’s disease. Biogen will also receive rights to opt into two programs and a right of first negotiation for two additional programs, in each case for neurodegenerative diseases leveraging Denali’s Transport Vehicle (TV) technology platform to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

“Our collaboration with Denali represents an opportunity to advance the development of a potential first-in-class oral therapy that may slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease,” said Michel Vounatsos, Biogen’s Chief Executive Officer. “Denali’s LRRK2 program is highly complementary to our existing Parkinson’s disease pipeline and its successful development would enhance Biogen’s portfolio of medicines for treating serious neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. We look forward to leveraging our neurology capabilities and infrastructure with Denali’s scientific expertise to accelerate advancement of this program.”

“We are very excited to collaborate with Biogen, a company with an impressive history in inventing and developing medicines for neurological diseases,” said Ryan Watts, Ph.D., Denali’s Chief Executive Officer. “This collaboration will allow us to accelerate the development of our LRRK2 program and gives us the resources to build a fully integrated company with the goal of bringing transformative medicines to patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.”

Under the agreement, Biogen will collaborate with Denali to co-develop and co-commercialize Denali’s small molecule inhibitors of LRRK2 for Parkinson’s disease. Biogen and Denali will co-commercialize the LRRK2 product in the U.S. and China, and Biogen will commercialize in all other markets. DNL151 has been selected to progress into late stage clinical studies expected to commence in 2021.

Mutations in the LRRK2 gene can cause Parkinson’s disease. LRRK2 is a regulator of lysosomal function, which is impaired in Parkinson’s disease and may contribute to neurodegeneration. Inhibition of LRRK2 activity may slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease in patients with and without known genetic risks based on restoration of lysosomal function. People who have Parkinson’s disease experience numerous symptoms, including tremors, slow movement, muscle stiffness and impaired balance. As these symptoms become progressively worse, patients have difficulty walking, talking or completing other simple tasks. Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease with significant unmet medical needs due to the absence of approved therapies that may slow disease progression.

In addition to the LRRK2 program, Biogen will also receive an exclusive option to license two preclinical programs from Denali’s TV platform, which aims to improve brain uptake of biotherapeutics, including its Antibody Transport Vehicle (ATV): Abeta program (ATV enabled anti-amyloid beta program) and a second program utilizing its TV technology. Further, Biogen will have right of first negotiation on two additional TV-enabled therapeutics, currently at a preclinical stage, should Denali decide to seek a collaboration for such programs. Denali’s TV platform is a proprietary technology designed to effectively deliver large therapeutic molecules such as antibodies, enzymes, proteins and oligonucleotides across the BBB after intravenous administration.

Terms of the Collaboration

Under the terms of the agreement, Biogen will make an upfront payment to Denali of $560 million and make a $465 million equity investment in Denali from the purchase of 13.3 million newly issued shares of Denali common stock at approximately $34.94 per share, representing 11.2 percent of Denali’s pro-forma outstanding stock.

Should the LRRK2 program achieve certain development and commercial milestones, Denali will be eligible to receive up to $1.125 billion in potential milestone payments.

In the LRRK2 collaboration, Biogen and Denali will share responsibility and costs for global development (60 percent Biogen; 40 percent Denali), and will share responsibility and costs as well as profits and losses for commercialization in the U.S. (50 percent Biogen; 50 percent Denali) and China (60 percent Biogen; 40 percent Denali). Outside the U.S. and China, Biogen will be responsible for commercialization and pay Denali tiered royalties.

Closing of the collaboration is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S., and other customary closing conditions.

About Denali’s LRRK2 DNL151 Program

DNL151 is a small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2 invented at Denali which has completed dosing of 162 healthy volunteers in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical study and completed dosing in 25 Parkinson’s patients in a Phase 1b clinical study. Denali is currently completing further dose escalation cohorts in an expanded Phase 1 and an additional cohort in the Phase 1b study to define the full therapeutic window of the molecule. Based on the clinical data to date that has been generated in Europe, DNL151 appears to have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and has met desired target engagement goals. An Investigational New Drug application for DNL151 was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2020 and enables expansion of Denali clinical trials for DNL151 globally.

Vrinda,40723,Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) + Paclitaxel Fail to Meet the Primary Endpoint in P-III IMpassion131 Study for Patients with Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,Roche provides update on Phase III study of Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel for people with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,"The P-III IMpassion131 study involves assessing of Tecentriq + paclitaxel vs PBO + paclitaxel, in 651 people in a ratio (2:1) with previously untreated, inoperable, LA/ m-TNBC
 The study did not meet its 1EPs of PFS for 1L treatment of people with m-TNBC) in the PD-L1+ population. The data for 2EPs of OS showed a negative trend, however, the study was not powered for the 2EPs of OS and data were immature at the time of analysis while OS follow-up is planned to continue until the final analysis
 In the previous IMpassion130 study, Tecentriq + Abraxane demonstrated PFS benefit and, while not formally tested, showed improvements in OS for people with metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1","Basel, 06 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the Phase III IMpassion131 study, evaluating Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with paclitaxel (chemotherapy), in comparison to placebo plus paclitaxel, did not meet statistical significance on its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) for the initial (first-line) treatment of people with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), in the PD-L1-positive population.

The data for the secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) showed a negative trend, however, the study was not powered for the secondary endpoint of OS and data were immature at time of analysis. OS follow-up is planned to continue until final analysis. Safety for the Tecentriq combination appeared to be consistent with the known safety profile of the individual medicines, and no new safety signals were identified.

In the previous IMpassion130 study, Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination with Abraxane® (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound); nab-paclitaxel) demonstrated a statistically significant PFS benefit and, while not formally tested, showed clinically meaningful improvements in OS for people with metastatic TNBC whose tumours express PD-L1 (≥1%). Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is approved in over 70 countries for the treatment of adults with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC whose tumours express PD-L1 (≥1%).

“While we are disappointed by the results from the IMpassion131 study, we are grateful for all the patients, families and physicians who were involved in the study,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Today’s results underscore the need to better understand the cancer and immune system interactions, including the chemotherapy backbone and associated regimens. We remain committed to finding optimal treatments for all people living with this aggressive disease.”

Full results from IMpassion131 are being discussed with global health authorities and will be presented at a future medical meeting. The insights will also be used to inform existing and future studies in triple-negative breast cancer with Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMpassion131 study
The IMpassion131 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel, in comparison to placebo plus paclitaxel, in people with previously untreated, inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. The study enrolled 651 people who were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive Tecentriq or placebo plus paclitaxel. The primary endpoint is PFS per investigator assessment (RECIST 1.1) in the PD-L1-positive population followed by intention-to-treat (ITT) populations. Secondary endpoints include OS, objective response rate and duration of response in the PD-L1-positive and ITT populations.

About triple-negative breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women with more than 2 million diagnosed worldwide each year.1 TNBC represents ~15% of all breast cancers and is more common in women under the age of 50, compared with other forms of breast cancer.2-4 It is defined by the lack of expression and/or amplification of the targetable receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and HER2 amplification.5 Patients with metastatic TNBC generally experience rapid progression and shorter OS compared to other subtypes of breast cancer.3

About Roche in breast cancer
Roche has been advancing breast cancer research for more than 30 years with the goal of helping as many people with the disease as possible. Our medicines, along with companion diagnostic tests, have contributed to bringing breakthrough innovations in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers. As our understanding of breast cancer biology rapidly improves, we are working to identify new biomarkers and approaches to treatment for all forms of early and advanced breast cancer, including triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive.

Our targeted medicines Herceptin, Perjeta, Kadcyla and Tecentriq are continuing to transform the treatment of early and advanced HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers and, through our Tecentriq and ipatasertib clinical programmes, we hope to bring new treatment combinations to people with breast cancer, ultimately improving outcomes.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for people with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

 In the 1L cohort, patients will receive dual regimens and patients in the 2L cohort will be randomized in a ratio (1:1) to receive treatment with U3-1402 as monothx. or in combination with Tagrisso. 258 patients will be enrolled in the study, which will be conducted in NA, EU, and Asia including Japan","Tokyo, Basking Ridge, N.J. and Munich – (August 6, 2020) – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) to evaluate the combination of patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402), a HER3 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC), and TAGRISSO (osimertinib), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 

There are no HER3 directed therapies approved for the treatment of NSCLC or any cancer. The frequency of HER3 overexpression in EGFR-mutated NSCLC has been reported to be as high as 75 percent, and there is evidence that HER3 expression may be associated with resistance to TKIs.[1],[2]

 

“The majority of patients with activating mutations of EGFR, or EGFR-mutated NSCLC, overexpress the HER3 protein in the cancer cells, and there is evidence that HER3 expression is a passenger marker of resistance to TKIs. Clinical and preclinical data, as well as biomarker expression and resistance mechanism research, support the further evaluation of patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO as a treatment combination for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with a TKI, typically TAGRISSO,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “This clinical trial collaboration supports our goal to optimize development of patritumab deruxtecan in patients with EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC to further improve current standards of care. Daiichi Sankyo is pleased to begin this focused collaboration with AstraZeneca on this important aspect of patritumab deruxtecan development.”

 

“In this trial, we will explore a new potential way to treat patients with advanced disease by combining TAGRISSO with patritumab deruxtecan, a HER3 directed ADC,” said Cristian Massacesi, Senior Vice President, Head of Late Stage Development Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “This combination approach represents one of our strategies of addressing tumor resistance. As we work to continue maximizing the benefit TAGRISSO can bring to patients, we look forward to collaborating with Daiichi Sankyo in this new area of study.”

 

About the Study

Under the terms of the agreement, Daiichi Sankyo will sponsor and conduct a multicenter, open-label, two-part phase 1 study evaluating patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO as both a first-line and second-line combination treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation.

 

The first part of the study (dose escalation) will assess the safety and tolerability of different dosing combinations of patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO to determine the recommended combination dose. The second part of the study (dose expansion) will include a first-line and second-line cohort that will further evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of the combination. Patients enrolled in the first-line cohort will receive patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO combination treatment, and patients in the second-line cohort will be randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with patritumab deruxtecan alone or in combination with TAGRISSO. Up to 258 patients will be enrolled into the study, which will be conducted in North America, Europe, and Asia including Japan.

 

The primary study objectives for the dose escalation part of the study include the assessment of the safety and tolerability of patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO. The primary objective for the dose expansion part of the study for both cohorts is the assessment of anti-tumor activity as measured by objective response rate (ORR) and as assessed by independent central review.

 

Unmet Need in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

Lung cancer is the most common cancer and is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide with an estimated 2.1 million new cases of lung cancer in 2018 and 1.8 million deaths.[3] Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers.[4]

 

Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are among the most frequently observed genomic alterations in NSCLC, affecting approximately 14 to 30 percent of patients with NSCLC.[5] For patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, targeted therapy with EGFR TKIs offers higher response rates, overall survival and progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy.[6] However, most patients eventually develop resistance to the TKIs, and new treatment approaches including combination strategies designed to overcome TKI resistance are needed.[7]

 

About HER3

HER3 is a member of the EGFR family of tyrosine kinase receptors, which are associated with normal as well as aberrant cell proliferation and survival.2 HER3 expression has been associated with an increased incidence of metastases and reduced survival in patients with NSCLC with expression frequency reported to be as high as 75 percent.1 A majority of EGFR-mutated NSCLCs show some level of HER3 expression.[8],[9] Currently, no HER3 directed therapies are approved for NSCLC or any cancer.

 

About Patritumab Deruxtecan (U3-1402)

Patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402) is one of three lead DXd antibody drug conjugates (ADC) in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo.

 

ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, patritumab deruxtecan is comprised of a human anti-HER3 antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker. It is designed to target and deliver chemotherapy inside cancer cells that express HER3 as a cell surface antigen.

 

Patritumab deruxtecan is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 study in previously treated patients with metastatic or unresectable NSCLC. Patritumab deruxtecan is also being evaluated in a phase 1/2 study in patients with HER3 expressing metastatic breast cancer.

 

Patritumab deruxtecan is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Vrinda,40725,Bausch Health to Spin off its Eye Health Business,Bausch Health to Spin off its Eye Health Business,"Bausch Health spin-off its leading eye health business into an independent publicly-traded company under the name Bausch + Lomb. The spinoff is expected to be completed in H1’21
 The spinoff will lead to the formation of two separate companies that include an eye-health company built on the iconic Bausch + Lomb brand and a diversified company with leading positions in gastroenterology, aesthetics/dermatology, neurology, and international pharmaceuticals
 Bausch + Lomb will consist of Bausch Health’s global vision care, surgical, consumer and ophthalmic Rx businesses which had generated $3.7B revenue in 2019. The other company would comprise brands across the Salix, International Rx, neurology and medical dermatology businesses that generated a revenue pf ~$4.9B in 2019","Spinoff Would Unlock Value in the Iconic Bausch + Lomb Brand and Integrated Portfolio of Eye Health Products

Transaction Will Enable BHC to Focus on Expanding Its Leadership in Gastroenterology, Aesthetics/Dermatology, Neurology and International Pharma

New Segmentation Enhances Focus and Highlights Two Highly Attractive, but Dissimilar Businesses

LAVAL, QC, Aug. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC) (“Bausch Health” or the “Company”) today announced that it intends to spin off its leading eye health business into an independent publicly traded entity (“Bausch + Lomb – NewCo”) from the remainder of Bausch Health (“BHC”). The spinoff will establish two separate companies that include:

A fully integrated, pure play eye-health company built on the iconic Bausch + Lomb brand and long history of innovation; and
A diversified pharmaceutical company with leading positions in gastroenterology, aesthetics/dermatology, neurology and international pharmaceuticals.
The benefits of separating these attractive, but disparate businesses include improved strategic focus and enhanced financial transparency to better enable stakeholders to value each business independently. The timing of the anticipated spinoff will be tied to certain conditions and approvals, and the Company’s completion of several important actions, including the reorganization of the reporting segments, which we expect to begin reporting in the first quarter of 2021.

“We are committed to taking action to unlock what we see as unrecognized value in Bausch Health shares, and we believe that separating our business into two highly focused, stand-alone companies is the way to accomplish that goal,” said Joseph C. Papa, chairman and CEO of Bausch Health. “Four years ago, we initiated a multi-phase plan, first to stabilize and then to transform Bausch Health into a company positioned to deliver long-term organic growth. We have divested approximately $4 billion of non-core assets, paid down over $8 billion of debt, resolved numerous legacy legal issues and managed a loss of exclusivity on an approximately $1.4 billion product portfolio, while also investing in R&D, new product launches­­ and core franchises with attractive growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors and management team have been working on alternatives over the last 12 months to determine how to best unlock value across our businesses, and we believe that the time is right to begin the separation process, so each business has greater flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities in their respective markets.”

Bausch + Lomb – NewCo
Bausch + Lomb – NewCo, which will consist of Bausch Health’s global vision care, surgical, consumer and ophthalmic Rx businesses, would have had 2019 revenue of approximately $3.7 billion and a CAGR of 4.1% (2017-2019). We believe that Bausch + Lomb – NewCo is well-positioned to continue delivering consistent organic revenue growth across the globe, with more than half of its sales outside of the United States. The combination of pipeline expansion and established durable eye care brands, including BAUSCH + LOMB ULTRA®, Biotrue® ONEday, LUMIFY®, Ocuvite® and PreserVision®, among others, as well as the launch of BAUSCH + LOMB INFUSE™ contact lenses, is expected to drive this growth.

BHC
BHC, which would have had 2019 revenue of approximately $4.9 billion and CAGR of 1.8% (2017-2019), will comprise a diversified portfolio of leading durable brands across the Salix, International Rx, Solta, neurology and medical dermatology businesses. Core products include XIFAXAN®, TRULANCE® and RELISTOR® for gastrointestinal diseases; JUBLIA®, DUOBRII® and Thermage® FLX for dermatologic conditions; and WELLBUTRIN® and APLENZIN® for neurological conditions.

Transaction Information
Bausch Health will need to take several steps to facilitate the completion of the spinoff. As a first step to preparing stand-alone carve-out financial statements, Bausch Health expects to report Bausch + Lomb as a separate segment beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Furthermore, there are several important internal and external considerations, approvals and conditions that will drive the ultimate timing and structure of any transaction, including, but not limited to, consideration of one-time costs; capital market conditions; determination of the pro forma capitalizations of Bausch + Lomb – NewCo and BHC; final approval by Bausch Health’s Board of Directors; receipt of applicable regulatory approvals; tax considerations, including receipt of any applicable opinions and/or rulings with respect to the Canadian and U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction; and compliance with U.S. and Canadian securities laws and stock exchange rules and any shareholder vote requirements that may be applicable. Many of these considerations, approvals and conditions will be influenced by and/or be dependent on the specific structure that is ultimately selected.

Bausch Health’s management has initiated a process to determine the future executive leadership teams for each company. As the separation process commences, the Company looks forward to providing additional information on the future management teams and Boards of Directors for both companies.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Goldman Sachs are serving as financial advisors; Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz in the United States, and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt in Canada are acting as lead legal counsels; and Davis, Polk & Wardwell is acting as tax counsel.

 In addition to EC approval, Elanco has received antitrust clearance for the transaction in China, Colombia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam, and provisional clearance in Brazil","Post by: Colleen Parr Dekker

GREENFIELD, Ind. (June 8, 2020) – Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted approval of Elanco’s pending acquisition of Bayer AG’s (ETR: BAYN) animal health business. The company continues to progress toward a mid-year closing, anticipated August 3, 2020.

“Approval from the European Commission is an important milestone toward the completion of our acquisition of Bayer Animal Health,” said Jeff Simmons, president and CEO of Elanco. “As the transaction edges closer to fruition, we look forward to turning our full attention to delivering innovation and an expanded portfolio of solutions for farmers, veterinarians and pet owners across the globe. The recent months have only underscored the critical work our farmers do in delivering meat, milk, fish and eggs, and the importance of providing pet owners and veterinarians with a variety of solutions in multiple channels from telemedicine and e-commerce to direct home delivery. Combining Bayer Animal Health’s leadership in these areas better positions Elanco to deliver on these needs.”

The complementary nature of this transaction, combining Elanco’s long-standing focus on the veterinarian with Bayer’s direct-to-consumer expertise, will strengthen and accelerate the company’s Innovation, Portfolio and Productivity strategy. The transaction advances Elanco’s portfolio transformation, creating a balance between the farm animal and pet businesses. It will also expand Elanco’s omnichannel approach, substantially diversifying its pet health business into the retail and e-commerce channels as Elanco continues to determine the best methods for reaching pet owners and veterinarians.

Elanco previously announced divestiture agreements in the range of $120 million to $140 million of revenue to help advance the needed regulatory reviews. The EC’s approval is conditional on several of these proposed divestitures, including:

Divestiture of the worldwide rights for Osurnia®, a treatment for otitis externa in dogs, being sold to Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC (LON: DPH)
Divestiture of the worldwide rights for Vecoxan®, used for prevention and treatment of coccidiosis in calves and lambs being sold to Merck Animal Health (also known as MSD Animal Health).
Divestiture of European Economic Area and UK rights to the Drontal® and Profender® product families and related pipeline assets from Bayer Animal Health being sold to Vetoquinol SA (EURONEXT: VETO), a French pharmaceutical company. These products are broad-spectrum de-wormers for dogs and cats.
In addition to EC approval, Elanco has received antitrust clearance for the transaction in China, Colombia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam, and provisional clearance in Brazil. Elanco continues to cooperate with agencies in other jurisdictions. Further, Elanco fully secured financing early in the first quarter of 2020 to complete the transaction through its completed equity issuance and pricing of its Term Loan B, which will fund at deal close.

The transaction remains subject to additional regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

MADISON, N.J., May 13, 2020 – Merck Animal Health, known as MSD Animal Health outside the United States and Canada, a division of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA (NYSE:MRK), and Virbac (NYSE Euronext:VIRP) today announced that the companies have signed a definitive agreement under which Merck Animal Health would acquire the U.S. rights to SENTINEL® FLAVOR TABS® and SENTINEL® SPECTRUM® Chews in the Companion Animal category. Merck Animal Health will make a cash payment of approximately $400 million to acquire the SENTINEL branded products in the United States at closing of the acquisition.

Comprehensive parasite protection is an essential part of canine overall health and well-being. The BRAVECTO® product line, which are our extended duration flea and tick protection products, and the SENTINEL branded products, which control all common intestinal parasites, provide an attractive opportunity for broad-spectrum, year-round comprehensive internal and external parasite protection for dogs. These complementary products will cover the seven common, harmful parasites that affect dogs inside and out by preventing ticks and multiple stages of the flea lifecycle, including eggs and adult fleas, as well as treating and controlling all common intestinal parasites, including roundworms, hookworms, whipworms and tapeworms and preventing heartworm disease.

“Veterinary medicines, including parasiticides, and vaccines have transformed the health of animals over the past decade,” said Rick DeLuca, president, Merck Animal Health. “This product acquisition reinforces Merck Animal Health’s commitment to our customers and our position in the United States Companion Animal category. We plan to use the extensive breadth and depth of our product portfolio, which includes BRAVECTO, a range of Companion Animal vaccines and the Sure Petcare portfolio of digital products, along with the SENTINEL branded products, to enhance our offerings of comprehensive pet care solutions. These products will provide a full range of complementary solutions for our customers to improve the health and well-being of animals and the people who care for them.”

Scott Bormann, senior vice president, North America Commercial Operations, Merck Animal Health, said, “Our unconditional commitment to the veterinary community is steadfast as we offer a broad range of products and services to our customers. With this product acquisition, we expect to provide veterinarians with the most comprehensive and continuous parasite protection for dogs in easy to administer, palatable formulations. These products will target different parts of the flea lifecycle and will offer broad-spectrum, internal parasite protection in the SENTINEL brand and the extended duration flea and tick protection of BRAVECTO.”

François Fournier, president and chief executive officer, Virbac United States, said, “These brands are well-known and trusted parasiticide products that should continue to provide value to both veterinary clinics and pet owners in the United States for years to come. We believe that Merck Animal Health is the right company, ideally positioned to keep developing these products in a sustainable manner.”

The closing of the transaction is subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by mid-year 2020.

 The FTC’s approval follows divestiture of global rights for Osurnia to treat otitis externa in dogs, US rights for Capstar that kills fleas in dogs and cats, and StandGuard that treat horn fly and lice control in beef cattle
 In addition to FTC approval, Elanco has received antitrust clearance for the transaction from the EC, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, New Zealand, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam","GREENFIELD, Ind. (July 15, 2020) – Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) today announced that the company has received unanimous approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its acquisition of Bayer Animal Health, a division of Bayer AG (ETR: BAYN). The FTC decision represents the final antitrust clearance needed to complete the transaction, which continues on track for closing at the beginning of August.

“This approval marks the near-final step in fulfilling our vision of bringing together two dedicated animal health companies focused on delivering innovation and an expanded portfolio of solutions to farmers, veterinarians and pet owners around the globe,” said Jeff Simmons, president and CEO of Elanco. “As we approach closing and look toward putting our integration plans into action, I want to thank everyone who has worked so tirelessly on this transaction, especially during these challenging times. Their hard work has positioned the combined company for success, and we look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Elanco in the very near future.”

The complementary transaction strengthens Elanco’s Innovation, Portfolio and Productivity strategy by combining Elanco’s long-standing focus on the veterinarian with Bayer’s direct-to-consumer expertise, proven even more important as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the transaction will advance Elanco’s intentional portfolio transformation, creating a balance between the farm animal and pet health businesses. It also expands Elanco’s omnichannel approach, substantially diversifying its pet health business into the retail and e-commerce channels allowing Elanco to reach pet owners and serve veterinarians with a multi-faceted approach.

Elanco continues to expect necessary worldwide divestitures to be in the previously announced range of $120 million to $140 million of annual revenue to help advance regulatory reviews. The FTC’s approval is conditional on the following proposed divestitures:

Worldwide rights for Elanco’s Osurnia®, a treatment for otitis externa in dogs, being sold to Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC (LON: DPH).
U.S. rights for Elanco’s Capstar®, an oral tablet that kills fleas in dogs and cats, being sold to PetIQ, Inc. (Nasdaq: PETQ).
U.S. rights for Elanco’s StandGuard®, a pour-on treatment for horn fly and lice control in beef cattle, being sold to Neogen Corporation (NASDAQ: NEOG).
In addition to FTC approval, Elanco has received antitrust clearance for the transaction from the European Commission (EC), as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, New Zealand, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam. Further, Elanco fully secured financing in the first quarter of 2020 through its equity issuance and pricing of its Term Loan B, which will fund at deal close. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions.

MADISON, N.J., July 9, 2020 – Merck Animal Health, known as MSD Animal Health outside the United States and Canada, a division of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA [NYSE: MRK], today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of BRAVECTO® 1-MONTH (fluralaner) Chews for dogs and puppies 8 weeks of age and older. The product is administered as a single, monthly flavored chew formulation for treatment and prevention of fleas and treatment and control of ticks. BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is expected to be available in the coming months.

BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is an important addition to the company’s parasiticide portfolio, which are extended duration flea and tick protection products that offer broad-spectrum, comprehensive parasite protection for dogs. This new product is suitable for dogs in the early stages of life to begin a regimen of monthly flea and tick protection. Pet owners now can begin their dog’s early life experience on this monthly product and have the option to easily transition to the extended duration BRAVECTO products as the dog reaches 6 months of age, helping to ensure consistent treatment and compliance.

“The approval of this additional BRAVECTO product builds on the strong foundation and body of scientific evidence that we have established over the years with our broad-spectrum, comprehensive line of parasite protection products,” said KJ Varma, BVSc, PhD, senior vice president, Research and Development, Merck Animal Health. “With BRAVECTO 1-MONTH, we have expanded our portfolio with a superior advance in the fight against parasites, as well as provided both adult dogs and puppies with flea and tick protection that delivers immediate and persistent killing activity.”

BRAVECTO 1-MONTH kills adult fleas and is indicated for the treatment and prevention of flea infestations (Ctenocephalides felis) and the treatment and control of tick infestations [Ixodes scapularis (black-legged tick), Dermacentor variabilis (American dog tick) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (brown dog tick)] for one month in dogs and puppies 8 weeks of age and older and weighing 4.4 pounds or greater. BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is also indicated for the treatment and control of Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick) infestations for one month in dogs and puppies 6 months of age and older and weighing 4.4 pounds or greater.

“Parasites pose serious animal and human health risks as fleas and ticks can transmit disease,” said Christine Royal, DVM, executive director, U.S. Companion Animal and Equine Professional Services, Merck Animal Health. “Effective protection against these parasites is essential to safeguard our pets as well as our homes. The approval of BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is an ideal start for dogs in the early stages of life with the benefit of a tasty, monthly chew formulation that is fast-acting and efficacious.”

BRAVECTO 1-MONTH contains fluralaner, an ectoparasiticide belonging to the isoxazoline class, which has systemic activity against ticks and fleas. The product is available in five strengths (45, 100, 200, 400 and 560 mg) per chew.

BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is part of the Merck Animal Health companion animal portfolio, which includes Sure Petcare, a range of digitally connected products, as well as a broad range of veterinary medicines and vaccines.

On July 2, 2020, Merck Animal Health announced the completion of its product acquisition for the U.S. rights to SENTINEL® FLAVOR TABS® and SENTINEL® SPECTRUM® Chews in the Companion Animal category. Comprehensive parasite protection is an essential part of canine overall health and well-being. The BRAVECTO product line, which are our extended duration flea and tick protection products, and the SENTINEL branded products, which control all common intestinal parasites, provide broad-spectrum, year-round comprehensive internal and external parasite protection for dogs. These complementary products will cover the seven common, harmful parasites that affect dogs inside and out by preventing ticks and multiple stages of the flea lifecycle, including eggs and adult fleas, as well as treating and controlling all common intestinal parasites, including roundworms, hookworms, whipworms and tapeworms and preventing heartworm disease.
