This is Zebra Medical Vision’s first solution for Oncology to receive FDA clearance, as part of the company’s AI1 “All-In-One” bundle. Zebra Medical is also the first startup to receive FDA clearances for AI based technology across three imaging modalities – CT, x-ray and mammography, providing coverage for roughly 80% of the total imaging volumes.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women, impacting 2.1 million women worldwide each year and causing the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women. It is estimated that 627,000 women died from breast cancer in 2018, approximately 15 percent of all cancer-related female deaths. While breast cancer rates are higher among women in more developed regions, rates are increasing in nearly every region globally1.

Zebra Medical’s HealthMammo solution is an automatic AI tool that indicates “suspicious” or “not suspicious” for every 2D mammography performed. The mammograms are automatically sent to Zebra Medical’s imaging analytics platform, where they are processed and analyzed for suspected breast lesions. The HealthMammo product then returns its result to the radiologist, either by signaling within the worklist or by notifying the user in a dedicated application.

The algorithm can be used in single reader paradigms, supporting triage and workflow improvement (as cleared by the FDA) or in double reading paradigms, already available outside of the US, supporting the second radiologists and reducing their workload.

Supporting early detection protocols, Zebra Medical Vision’s HealthMammo product helps health providers minimize the COVID-19-induced care gaps with an automated AI tool that can identify faster patients with suspicious lesions. According to the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Mammography Quality Standards program (MQSA), approximately 40 million mammograms are performed in the U.S. every year. With the outbreak of coronavirus, annual mammography tests during lockdown were postponed or canceled. As a result, providers are dealing with substantial growing backlogs, as 100,000 screens are added every day in the US alone2, in addition to a 94% drop in mammography imaging volumes during lockdown3. Patients are experiencing increasing anxiety waiting to be tested and run the risk of missing the early detection component of annual screening which could result in an undetected cancer that keeps growing.

“As restrictions are lifted from the COVID-19 crisis, the backlog of mammograms has increased,” says Dr. Michael Fishman, Breast Imaging Section Chief at Boston Medical Center (BMC), Massachusetts. “Zebra Medical Vision’s HealthMammo may help radiologists deal with the screening management strategy of the post COVID backlog and triaging.”

“Our work is twofold: supporting the medical team’s overload and ensuring the well-being of patients, by supporting early detection and reducing the anxiety surrounding uncertainty,” says Ohad Arazi, CEO of Zebra Medical Vision. “The fact that during initial testings we were able to identify 2 cases that were missed, and to have these women be recalled and diagnosed with cancer, shows the vast impact and potential contribution of AI in Oncology. With this fully commercial and regulated product, we aim to provide even more value and help patients and providers navigate the new COVID effected reality we are all facing. We’re proud of the achievements we’ve made in the past few months, providing U.S. healthcare with a growing portfolio of automatic solutions to enhance patient care, especially during these times.”

This license agreement does not impact UCB’s 2020 financial outlook.

UCB continues to develop UCB0107 in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), with a confirmatory phase 3 study due to commence in Q2 2021.

About UCB0107

UCB0107 is a recombinant, humanized, full-length IgG4 monoclonal antibody, targeting a central Tau epitope, which is being developed to block/reduce the spread of Tau pathology.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein expressed in the central nervous system, which supports the assembly and stabilization of neuronal microtubules.[1] In tauopathies, Tau becomes pathogenic, forming tangles, which cause cell damage and ultimately neuronal death.[1.2.3] It is hypothesised that the spread of Tau protein from neuron to neuron underpins disease progression in tauopathies[4] providing the rationale for antibody therapies.

Forward looking statements UCB

This press release may contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “seeks”, “estimates”, “may”, “will”, “continue” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and beliefs of management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial information, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements of UCB, or industry results, to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19, changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’ efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also, UCB or others could discover safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products.

 The vaccine is deploying Sanofi’s S-protein COVID-19 antigen together with GSK’s adjuvant technology. Both the companies are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant to produce up to 1B doses per year","Agreement relates to vaccine candidate using Sanofi’s recombinant protein-based technology combined with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system
Both companies are committed to making their COVID-19 vaccine candidate affordable and available globally
Ongoing discussions with the European Commission, with France and Italy on the negotiation team, and other governments to ensure global access to a novel coronavirus vaccine
PARIS and LONDON – July 29, 2020 – Sanofi and GSK have reached an agreement, subject to final contract, with the UK government for the supply of up to 60 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine candidate, developed by Sanofi in partnership with GSK, is based on the recombinant protein-based technology used by Sanofi to produce an influenza vaccine, and GSK’s established pandemic adjuvant technology.

“With our partner GSK, we are pleased to cooperate with the UK government as well as several other countries and global organizations as part of our ongoing efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine and make it available as quickly as possible. We greatly appreciate the UK government’s support of this shared vision,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur.

Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added, “We believe that this adjuvanted vaccine candidate has the potential to play a significant role in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic, both in the UK and around the world.  We thank the UK Government for confirmation of purchasing intent, which supports the significant investment we are already making as a company to scale up development and production of this vaccine.”

Sanofi is leading the clinical development and registration of the COVID-19 vaccine and expects a Phase 1/2 study to start in September, followed by a Phase 3 study by the end of 2020.  If the data are positive, regulatory approval could be achieved by the first half of 2021.  In parallel, Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant to produce up to one billion doses per year overall.

UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: “Our scientists and researchers are racing to find a safe and effective vaccine at a speed and scale never seen before. While this progress is truly remarkable, the fact remains that there are no guarantees.”

“In the meantime, it is important that we secure early access to a diverse range of promising vaccine candidates, like GSK and Sanofi, to increase our chances of finding one that works so we can protect the public and save lives.” 

Kate Bingham, Chair of the UK Government’s Vaccines Taskforce, said: “Through this agreement with GSK and Sanofi, the Vaccine Taskforce can add another type of vaccine to the three different types of vaccine we have already secured.  

“This diversity of vaccine types is important because we do not yet know which, if any, of the different types of vaccine will prove to generate a safe and protective response to COVID-19. Whilst this agreement is very good news, we mustn’t be complacent or over optimistic.” 

“The fact remains we may never get a vaccine and if we do get one, we have to be prepared that it may not be a vaccine which prevents getting the virus, but rather one that reduces symptoms.” 

Sanofi and GSK are committed to making the vaccine available globally

Active discussions on supply of the vaccine are ongoing with global organizations, the U.S. and the EU Commission, with France and Italy on the negotiation team. The partners  plan to provide a significant portion of total worldwide available supply capacity in 2021/22 to the global initiative, “Access to COVID‐19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator”, a global collaboration of leaders of governments, global health organizations, businesses and philanthropies to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

On the front lines in the fight against COVID-19

In addition to the recombinant protein-based vaccine in collaboration with GSK, Sanofi is also developing a messenger RNA vaccine candidate in partnership with Translate Bio. With several innovative vaccine platforms currently being investigated across the industry, mRNA is considered among the most promising. Sanofi expects a Phase 1 study to start by the end of the year, and, if the data are positive, an approval at the earliest in the second half of 2021​. Translate Bio has established mRNA manufacturing capacity and Sanofi expects to be able to supply annual capacity of 90 to 360 million doses.

 The FDA’s BT designation is granted to expedite the development and review of medicines that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and have demonstrated preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the medicine may provide a substantial improvement over available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint
 MK-6482 (formerly PT2977) is an investigational oral HIF-2α inhibitor, currently being evaluated in a P-III trial in advanced RCC (NCT04195750), a P-II trial in VHL-associated RCC (NCT03401788), and a P-I/II dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial in advanced solid tumors, including advanced RCC (NCT02974738)","Reinforces Important Progress in Merck’s Oncology Pipeline to Advance Novel Therapeutic Candidates

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to the hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2α) inhibitor MK-6482, a novel investigational candidate in Merck’s oncology pipeline, for the treatment of patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC)with nonmetastatic RCC tumors less than three centimeters in size, unless immediate surgery is required. The FDA also granted orphan drug designation to MK-6482 for VHL disease. These designations are based on data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating MK-6482 in patients with VHL-associated clear cell RCC, which were presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.

“Merck’s diverse and expansive oncology pipeline is focused on bringing forward innovative new treatments to patients in need and continues to show important progress,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “These designations for MK-6482 support the potential of targeting HIF-2α in certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease, who currently have limited treatment options and face an increased risk for benign tumors as well as several types of cancer, including renal cell carcinoma.”

The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation is granted to expedite the development and review of medicines that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that have demonstrated preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the medicine may provide a substantial improvement over available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint. The FDA’s orphan drug designation is granted to medicines that are intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.

About MK-6482

MK-6482 (formerly PT2977) is an investigational, novel, potent, selective, oral HIF-2α inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 trial in advanced RCC (NCT04195750), a Phase 2 trial in VHL-associated RCC (NCT03401788), and a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial in advanced solid tumors, including advanced RCC (NCT02974738). Proteins known as hypoxia-inducible factors, including HIF-2α, can accumulate in patients when VHL, a tumor-suppressor protein, is inactivated. The accumulation of HIF-2α can lead to the formation of both benign and malignant tumors. This inactivation of VHL has been observed in more than 90% of ccRCC tumors. Research into VHL biology that led to the discovery of HIF-2α was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2019.

About Von Hippel-Lindau Disease and Renal Cell Carcinoma

Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare genetic disease that affects one in 36,000 people (200,000 cases worldwide and 10,000 cases in the U.S. alone). Patients with VHL disease are at risk for benign blood vessel tumors as well as several cancers, including RCC. As many as 60% of people with VHL disease develop RCC, which is a leading cause of death for patients with VHL disease.

Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine of 10 kidney cancers are RCCs, and about seven of 10 RCCs are clear cell. Worldwide, it is estimated there were about 403,000 cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and about 175,000 deaths from the disease in 2018. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated there will be nearly 74,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and almost 15,000 deaths from the disease in 2020.

Merck’s Focus on Cancer

Our goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At Merck, the potential to bring new hope to people with cancer drives our purpose and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment. As part of our focus on cancer, Merck is committed to exploring the potential of immuno-oncology with one of the largest development programs in the industry across more than 30 tumor types.

40708,Roche's Tecentriq + Cotellic and Zelboraf Receives the US FDA's Approval for Patients with Advanced Melanoma,FDA approves Roche’s Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf for people with advanced melanoma,"The approval is based on P-III IMspire150 study assessing Tecentriq (atezolizumab) + Cotellic (cobimetinib) + Zelboraf (vemurafenib) vs PBO + Cotellic + Zelboraf in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma
 Results: mPFS (15.1 vs 10.6mos.); the safety profile of the Tecentriq combination was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines. The review was conducted under Project Orbis
 Tecentriq is a mAb targeting PD-L1, acts by blocking is its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptor. Cotellic is a MEK1/2 inhibitor in a cell signaling pathway that helps control cell growth and survival while Zelboraf is a prescription medicine for melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery and has a BRAF V600 mutation","Basel, 31 July 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) plus Cotellic® (cobimetinib) and Zelboraf® (vemurafenib) for the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma patients.  The safety profile observed in the Tecentriq combination was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines.

The supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Tecentriq was granted under priority review.  The review was also conducted under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners.

“When receiving a cancer immunotherapy combined with targeted therapies, patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma were able to live for more than 15 months without their disease worsening,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Genentech’s chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “Today’s FDA approval of this Tecentriq combination represents an important step forward for many patients living with advanced melanoma.”

The approval is based on results from the Phase III IMspire150 study, in which the addition of Tecentriq to Cotellic and Zelboraf helped people live longer without disease worsening or death compared to placebo plus Cotellic and Zelboraf (median PFS 15.1 months versus 10.6 months respectively; hazard ratio, HR=0.78; confidence interval: 0.63-0.97; P=0.025).  The most common adverse reactions (rate ≥20%) in patients who received Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf were rash (75%), musculoskeletal pain (62%), fatigue (51%), hepatotoxicity (50%), pyrexia (49%), nausea (30%), pruritus (26%), edema (26%), stomatitis (23%), hypothyroidism (22%), and photosensitivity reaction (21%).

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMspire150 study
IMspire150 is a Phase III, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study in people with previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. The study compared the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf to the combination of placebo plus Cotellic and Zelboraf. The primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed PFS. Key secondary endpoints include PFS by an independent review committee, overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response and other safety and pharmacokinetic measures.

Five hundred and fourteen adult patients took part in the study. Randomisation was stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and geographic region. Eligible patients were randomised 1:1 to one of two treatment groups, to receive 28-day cycles of either: Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf (the Tecentriq group) or Placebo plus Cotellic and Zelboraf (the control group). In cycle 1, all patients received once-daily oral Cotellic 60 mg plus twice-daily oral Zelboraf 960 mg for 21 days followed by twice-daily Zelboraf 720 mg or 960 mg for 7 days in the Tecentriq group or control group, respectively. Patients in the Tecentriq group received Zelboraf 720 mg Days 1–28 of each subsequent cycle. The lower 720 mg dose of Zelboraf in the Tecentriq group was a safety measure to mitigate the risk of overlapping toxicities, while ensuring an efficacious dose of Zelboraf. Treatment was continued until investigator-determined disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, patient or physician decision to withdraw, whichever occurred first.

About advanced melanoma
Melanoma is a less common, but more aggressive and potentially deadly form of skin cancer.1,2 When melanoma is diagnosed early, it is generally a curable disease,3,4 but most people with advanced melanoma have a poor prognosis.2 More than 287,000 people worldwide are currently diagnosed with melanoma each year.5 BRAF is mutated in approximately half of melanomas.6 In recent years, there have been significant advances in treatment for advanced melanoma and people with the disease have more options. However, it continues to be a serious health issue with a high medical need and a steadily increasing incidence over the past 30 years.7

About Tecentriq (atezolizumab)
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1. Tecentriq is designed to bind to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the re-activation of T cells. Tecentriq may also affect normal cells.

About Cotellic (cobimetinib)
Cotellic is designed to inhibit MEK1/2, proteins in a cell signaling pathway that helps control cell growth and survival. Cotellic, when used in combination with Zelboraf, is approved in the United States and Europe, as well as many countries around the world, for the treatment of people with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery and has a BRAF V600 mutation. Cotellic was discovered by Exelixis and is being developed by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in collaboration with Exelixis.

About Zelboraf (vemurafenib)
Zelboraf is a prescription medicine for the treatment of people with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery and has a BRAF V600 mutation. Zelboraf is designed to inhibit some mutated forms of BRAF, which cause abnormal signaling inside cancer cells leading to tumor growth. BRAF is a protein in a cell signaling pathway that helps control cell growth and survival. Zelboraf was the first approved product in its class. Zelboraf was co-developed under a 2006 license and collaboration agreement between Roche and Plexxikon Inc., the small molecule structure-guided R&D center of the Daiichi Sankyo Group.

 Pevonedistat is a first in class NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor. The pre-clinical studies demonstrated the inhibition of NAE, blocked the modification of select proteins, which resulted in the disruption of cell cycle progression and cell survival, leading to cancer cell death","– Designation Based on Phase 2 Data and Reinforces Significant Treatment Need for HR-MDS 

– Pevonedistat Could be First Novel Treatment Option for HR-MDS in More Than a Decade 

 

Cambridge, Mass. and Osaka, Japan, July 30, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for its investigational drug pevonedistat for the treatment of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS). Pevonedistat, a first in class NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, could be the first novel treatment for HR-MDS patients in more than a decade, expanding treatment options that have so far been limited to hypomethylating agent (HMA) monotherapy alone. Even with current treatment options, outcomes for people living with HR-MDS remain poor.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based on the final analysis of the Pevonedistat-2001 Phase 2 study, which evaluated pevonedistat plus azacitidine versus azacitidine alone in patients with rare leukemias, including HR-MDS. The FDA considered a number of endpoints, including overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), complete remission (CR) and transfusion independence, as well as the adverse event profile. This designation signals a potential advancement in addressing the needs of people living with HR-MDS, for whom few therapies exist and the benefits are limited.

“Higher-risk MDS is associated with poor prognosis, diminished quality of life and a higher chance of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, another aggressive cancer. The combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine is a promising therapeutic approach with the potential to be the first novel treatment advancement for higher-risk MDS in more than 10 years,” said Christopher Arendt, Head, Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “We thank the FDA for recognizing pevonedistat, and the urgency to develop innovative therapies that address critical treatment needs for higher-risk MDS, a patient population with few options.”

Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. FDA is granted to accelerate the development and regulatory review of investigational drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening ailments. Agents with this designation have shown preliminary clinical evidence that indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.

Takeda presented results of the Pevonedistat-2001 trial during oral sessions at the virtual 56th American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and virtual 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress.

 

About Pevonedistat
Pevonedistat is a first in class NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor. In pre-clinical studies, the inhibition of NAE by pevonedistat blocked the modification of select proteins, which resulted in disruption of cell cycle progression and cell survival, leading to cancer cell death. Pevonedistat in combination with azacitidine demonstrated promising clinical activity in a Phase 2 study of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS), higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (HR-CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a Phase 1 study of patients with AML. Pevonedistat is currently being evaluated in Phase 3 studies as a first-line treatment for patients with HR-MDS, HR-CMML and AML, who are ineligible (unfit) for transplant or intensive induction chemotherapy, and in a Phase 2 study in unfit AML in a triple combination with azacitidine and venetoclax. Pevonedistat is an investigational drug for which safety and efficacy have not been established.

About MDS
MDS is a rare form of bone marrow-related cancer caused by irregular blood cell production within the bone marrow. This cancer most commonly affects older patients, with the median age of diagnosis ranging from 60 to 74 years. As a result of this irregular production, a person with MDS does not have enough normal red blood cells, white blood cells and/or platelets in circulation. Symptoms for MDS are often vague and related to low blood counts, and may include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising or bleeding, loss of appetite, weakness, pale skin, fever and frequent or severe infections.

There are several classifications of MDS – very low-risk to very high-risk – determined by blood counts, blast counts, mutations and cytogenetics. Higher-risk disease is defined as intermediate, high or very high risk on the International Prognostic Scoring System – Revised (IPSS-R), and these patients have a poorer prognosis. Approximately 40% of patients with HR-MDS transform to AML, another aggressive cancer with poor outcomes.

The VENTANA HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail assay is designed to be completed within the same day, enabling clinicians to get results back faster than with other common methods of confirmatory testing for HER2. Results can be read using light microscopy, eliminating the need for a specialised fluorescence microscope.

“With this new VENTANA HER2 Dual ISH assay, Roche continues to deliver on its commitment to advance personalised healthcare,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Quick test results are crucial in the fight against cancer and by delivering critical information on treatment options for breast cancer patients faster, this assay will aid clinicians in their therapeutic decisions.”

This assay was launched as a CE IVD in April 2019.

The new VENTANA HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail assay is one component of Roche’s comprehensive breast cancer solutions portfolio designed to help inform decision making in cancer care and contribute to improved patient outcomes. For more information about the assay and the portfolio, please visit the Roche Tissue Diagnostics breast cancer IHC/ISH portfolio page or the Anatomic Pathology site.

About the VENTANA HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail assay
Roche is the only provider of an FDA approved ready-to-use brightfield Dual ISH solution for the detection of HER2 amplification. The new VENTANA HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail assay is optimised for use with the VENTANA Silver ISH DNP Detection Kit and the VENTANA Red ISH DIG Detection Kit on the fully-automated BenchMark ULTRA.
The VENTANA HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail assay is an enhanced version of the previous-generation test. New oligonucleotide probes and highly sensitive detection kits provide clear results to pathology labs more quickly, allowing clinicians to make treatment decisions earlier.

As a global leader in breast cancer diagnostics, Roche provides a comprehensive menu of both diagnostic and predictive assays, including the PATHWAY HER2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody that is indicated as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom Herceptin treatment is considered.

About Herceptin (trastuzumab)
Herceptin® is a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target and block the function of the HER2 receptor, a protein found on the outside of many normal cells and in high quantities on the outside of cancer cells in HER2-positive cancers. Herceptin binds to a specific section of the HER2 protein, inhibiting the signals it sends that encourage tumour cell growth, while also calling on the body’s immune system to attack the cancer cells.

Since it was first approved in 1998, Herceptin has been used to treat over two million patients worldwide, diagnosed with HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. It has also become the backbone of other innovative treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer, which have continued to improve the outcomes of patients with this otherwise aggressive disease. In addition to the standard intravenous formulation, Herceptin is available in a subcutaneous (SC) formulation which was first approved in 2013. Herceptin SC represents a significant step forward in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer as it offers patients a faster, more convenient and less painful way to receive treatment with Herceptin.

 The US government has an option to supply an additional 500M dose and helps the government’s Operation Warp Speed goals for providing millions of doses of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine
 Additionally, the companies are in discussion with the EC for the supply of up to 300M doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Both the companies are committed to making their COVID-19 vaccine affordable and available globally","Issued: London, UK and Paris, France

Discussions relate to vaccine candidate using Sanofi’s recombinant protein-based technology combined with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system
Both companies are committed to making their COVID-19 vaccine affordable and available globally
Sanofi and GSK are in advanced discussions with the European Commission (EC) for the supply of up to 300 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine candidate developed by Sanofi in partnership with GSK, is based on the recombinant protein-based technology used by Sanofi to produce an influenza vaccine, and GSK’s established adjuvant technology. The doses would be manufactured in European countries including France, Belgium, Germany and Italy. This marks a key milestone in protecting and serving the European population against COVID-19.

“Today’s announcement helps to ensure that millions of Europeans will have access to a potential vaccine protecting against COVID-19, once proven safe and effective. It has been our steadfast commitment to provide a vaccine that is affordable and accessible to everyone, and we are grateful to the European Commission for their ongoing engagement and shared support of this effort,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur. “Together with GSK, we are working relentlessly to develop and produce a vaccine to address this global health crisis.”

Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added “GSK is proud to be working in partnership with Sanofi to make this vaccine available as soon as possible in Europe. Both companies have significant R&D and manufacturing capability in Europe and are already working hard to scale up production across our networks. This announcement from the EC supports our ongoing efforts.”

Sanofi is leading the clinical development and registration of the COVID-19 vaccine and expects a Phase 1/ 2 study to start in September, followed by a Phase 3 study by the end of 2020. If data are positive, regulatory approval could be achieved by the first half of 2021. In parallel, Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant to produce up to one billion doses per year overall.

Sanofi and GSK are committed to making the vaccine available globally
Sanofi and GSK recently signed agreements with the United States where they have a longstanding partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and also with the UK Government. The partners plan to provide a significant portion of total worldwide available supply capacity in 2021/22 to the global initiative “Access to COVID‐19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator,” a global collaboration of leaders of governments, global health organizations, businesses and philanthropies to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

GSK commitment to tackling COVID-19
GSK is collaborating with companies and research groups across the world working on promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates through the use of our innovative vaccine adjuvant technology. The use of an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protecting more people. GSK does not expect to profit from COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic phase, and will invest any short-term profit in coronavirus related research and long-term pandemic preparedness, either through GSK internal investments or with external partners.

 The company will enroll up to ~2400 patients and test whether a single dose of LY-CoV555 reduces the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection @4wks. as well as complications of COVID-19 @8wks.
 LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 mAb, directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The therapy emerges from the collaboration b/w Lilly and AbCellera to create Ab therapies for the prevention & treatment of COVID-19","– More than 40 percent of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. linked to long-term care facilities; urgent need for therapeutic strategies to prevent COVID-19 in this vulnerable population – First-of-its-kind study will enroll up to 2,400 residents and staff at long-term care facilities; will utilize customized mobile research units to conduct the study on-site

INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced the initiation of BLAZE-2, a Phase 3 trial studying LY-CoV555 for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities in the U.S. (skilled nursing facilities, commonly referred to as nursing homes, and assisted living facilities). LY-CoV555, the lead antibody from Lilly’s collaboration with AbCellera, is a neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 among residents of long-term care facilities combined with the higher mortality rate for the elderly creates the urgent need for therapies to prevent COVID-19 in this vulnerable population.

“COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on nursing home residents. We’re working as fast as we can to create medicines that might stop the spread of the virus to these vulnerable individuals. While it’s not easy to conduct clinical trials in this setting, we’re taking on the challenge in an effort to help those who need us the most,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “We are grateful to the NIAID team for their exceptional partnership on this innovative trial and we are deeply appreciative of the care facilities, their staff and the many residents who will be participating in this important study.”

The Lilly-sponsored BLAZE-2 study is a first-of-its-kind COVID-19 trial and is being conducted in partnership with NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), along with the COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) and several long-term care facility networks across the country. The study will enroll residents and staff who live or work at facilities that have had a recently diagnosed case of COVID-19 and who are now at a high risk of exposure. It will evaluate the efficacy and safety of LY-CoV555 for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, testing whether a single dose of LY-CoV555 reduces the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 4 weeks, as well as complications of COVID-19 through 8 weeks. It is expected to enroll up to 2,400 participants.

“The mission of the COVID-19 Prevention Network is to conduct Phase 3 vaccine and monoclonal antibody efficacy studies for the prevention of COVID-19,” said Myron Cohen, M.D., director of UNC’s Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases and a CoVPN leader. “We’re excited to partner with Lilly to determine whether LY-CoV555 can prevent or mitigate progression of COVID-19 infection in this vulnerable population that has been greatly impacted by this virus.”

To address the challenging aspects of running a clinical trial in a long-term care facility during a pandemic, Lilly created customized mobile research units to support the on-site study. These units include a custom retrofitted recreational vehicle (RV) to support mobile labs and clinical trial material preparation, along with a trailer truck that will deliver all clinical trial supplies needed to create an on-site infusion clinic. To further minimize the burden on these facilities that normally do not conduct clinical trials, additional staff will be at the facilities to assist with the operations of the study. Lilly will deploy its mobile research unit fleet in response to outbreaks of the virus at long-term care facilities across the U.S.

“We commend Lilly and NIH in recognizing the critical need for developing medicines to combat the spread of the virus among some of the most vulnerable populations,” said Dr. Alexander Stemer, a board certified infectious disease expert and co-chair of Symphony Care Network’s COVID-19 task force. “As the scientific community searches for safe and effective therapies for COVID-19, we are proud to participate in this leading-edge study given its potential to save lives.”

About LY-CoV555
LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. LY-CoV555 emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and tested by the scientists at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed dosing of LY-CoV555 in a Phase 1 study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628) and long-term follow-up is ongoing. BLAZE-1, a Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (NCT04427501), is ongoing.  Based on current trends, enrollment is estimated to be completed in September, with initial data readout soon thereafter followed by full data in Q4. LY-CoV555 has been well tolerated at all doses tested and no drug-related severe adverse events (SAEs) have been observed to date. Efficacy data are not yet available.

Lilly is committed to the rapid release of important scientific data. Large-scale manufacturing of this potential therapy continues, with the goal of having more than one hundred thousand doses available by the end of the year should LY-CoV555 prove to be a meaningful therapeutic option for COVID-19.

40715,"Janssen's Darzalex (daratumumab, SC) Receives Health Canada Approval for the Treatment of Patients with Multiple Myeloma","Janssen Announces Health Canada Approval of DARZALEX SC, a New Subcutaneous Formulation for the Treatment of Patients with Multiple Myeloma","The Health Canada has approved Darzalex SC (daratumumab) in four regimens across five indications in patients with MM, notably newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible patients as well as relapsed/refractory patients
 The approval is based on P-III COLUMBA and P-II PLEIADES studies. The P-III study demonstrated a consistent ORR (41% vs 37%), with PK & safety profile compared with Darzalex IV in patients with RRMS, 2/3rd reduction in systemic ARRs (13% vs 34%)
 In P-II PLEIADES study evaluates Darzalex SC + D-VMP in newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible patients & Darzalex SC + (D-Rd) in R/R patients prior treated with 1L therapy. In general, Darzalex SC reduces administration time from hours to minutes and demonstrates consistent efficacy with a reduction in administration-related reactions","DARZALEX® SC reduces administration time from hours to minutes and demonstrates consistent efficacy with a reduction in administration-related reactions compared to intravenous DARZALEX® (daratumumab)

TORONTO, Aug. 4, 2020 /CNW/ – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that Health Canada has approved DARZALEX® SC (daratumumab), a new subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab.1 DARZALEX® SC is approved in four regimens across five indications in patients with multiple myeloma, most notably newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible patients as well as relapsed or refractory patients. As a fixed-dose formulation, DARZALEX® SC can be administered over approximately three to five minutes, significantly less time than intravenous (IV) DARZALEX®, which is administered over hours.2 DARZALEX® SC is the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved in the treatment of multiple myeloma.

In the Phase 3 COLUMBA study published in The Lancet, DARZALEX® SC demonstrated a consistent overall response rate (ORR) and pharmacokinetics and a similar safety profile compared with IV DARZALEX® in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In addition, there was a nearly two-thirds reduction in systemic administration-related reactions (ARRs) for DARZALEX® SC compared to IV DARZALEX® (13 per cent vs. 34 per cent, respectively).3

“DARZALEX® has become a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma, supported by a robust body of evidence in both the frontline and relapsed and refractory settings,” says Dr. Darrell White, Hematologist, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax. “With this new subcutaneous formulation, not only is treatment much more convenient for patients, but it will also play a very important role in reducing wait times and the burden on our busy healthcare system, especially during this time.”

The approval is based on data from the Phase 3 COLUMBA and Phase 2 PLEIADES studies.4,5 In the COLUMBA study, the ORR was non-inferior for patients taking DARZALEX® SC as monotherapy compared to those taking IV DARZALEX® as monotherapy (41 per cent vs. 37 per cent, respectively). 6 Additionally, in the Phase 2 PLEIADES study evaluating the efficacy and safety of DARZALEX® SC in combination therapies, objective responses were demonstrated in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP) in newly diagnosed transplant ineligible patients. In addition, objective responses were demonstrated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd) in relapsed or refractory patients who received one prior line of therapy.7 In a pooled safety population of 490 patients who received DARZALEX® SC as monotherapy or in combination, the ARR rate was 11 per cent.8

DARZALEX® SC is approved in all current IV indications including (1) in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, (2) in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy, (3) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy, and (4) as monotherapy, in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.9

Active discussions are ongoing with public insurers to determine how DARZALEX® SC can be made accessible for both relapsed or refractory patients as well as newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible patients.

“This approval exemplifies Janssen’s mission and commitment to bringing together passion, science and ingenuity to advance novel solutions for patients,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC.

About the COLUMBA Study
The randomised, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 COLUMBA study included 522 patients (median age of 67 years) with multiple myeloma who had received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), or whose disease was refractory to both a PI and an ImiD. In the arm that received DARZALEX® SC (n=263), patients received a fixed dose of DARZALEX® SC 1,800 milligrams (mg), co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) 2,000 Units per milliliter (U/mL), subcutaneously weekly for Cycles 1 – 2, every two weeks for Cycles 3 – 6 and every four weeks for Cycle 7 and thereafter. In the IV DARZALEX® arm (n=259), patients received DARZALEX® for IV infusion 16 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) weekly for Cycles 1 – 2, every two weeks for Cycles 3 – 6 and every four weeks for Cycle 7 and thereafter. Each cycle was 28 days. In the arm that received DARZALEX® SC, it was given in a fixed volume of 15 mL over three to five minutes; the median injection time was five minutes. In the arm that received the IV administration, the median durations of the first, second and subsequent IV DARZALEX® infusions were 7.0, 4.3 and 3.4 hours, respectively. Patients in both arms continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.10,11

About the PLEIADES Study
The non-randomised, open-label, parallel assignment Phase 2 PLEIADES study included adults with multiple myeloma, including 67 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were treated with 1,800 mg of DARZALEX® SC in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) and 65 patients with relapsed or refractory disease who were treated with 1,800 mg of DARZALEX® SC plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd). The primary endpoint for the D-VMP and D- Rd cohorts was overall response rate.12

About DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC
DARZALEX® is the first CD38-directed monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved to treat multiple myeloma and in 2020, DARZALEX® SC (daratumumab) follows as the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved to treat patients with multiple myeloma.13 It binds to CD38, a surface protein highly expressed across multiple myeloma cells.14 DARZALEX® induces tumor cell death through cell lysis via multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).15  DARZALEX® has also demonstrated immunomodulatory effects such as increasing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells counts, which may contribute to clinical response.16

In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize DARZALEX®. Janssen Inc. commercializes DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC in Canada. For full Prescribing Information and more information about DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC, please visit www.janssen.com/canada.

About Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.17 When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow. In 2020, it is estimated that 3,400 Canadians will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma and there will be 1,600 deaths associated with the disease.18 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms in the early stages, patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone disease or pain, anemia, calcium elevation, and kidney problems.19

August 04, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
OAKLAND, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Eko today announced a global collaboration with AstraZeneca to accelerate the development of digital health tools for the earlier screening of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure.

“Eko’s collaboration with AstraZeneca will allow us to expand the capability of our technology, generate real-world data, and explore disease management solutions while leveraging AstraZeneca’s global expertise and existing relationships across the treatment continuum for heart failure.”

Tweet this

Through the collaboration, AstraZeneca and Eko will explore accelerating the development of Eko algorithms, enhancing clinical trials with Eko technology and potentially building new heart failure detection solutions.

Heart failure is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, affecting approximately 64 million people worldwide. Heart failure happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood into the body and is most commonly detected by echocardiogram imaging tests that are not normally conducted during a physical exam. Because of the limited access to echocardiography or other diagnostic tests, heart failure is frequently diagnosed late, making life-prolonging treatment more challenging. Heart failure remains as fatal as some of the most common cancers and is the leading cause of hospitalization for those over the age of 65, representing a significant clinical and economic burden.

Joris Silon, Senior Vice President, Cardiovascular Renal and Metabolism, AstraZeneca, said, “There are millions of people living with or at risk for heart failure. AstraZeneca’s collaboration with Eko will tap into cutting-edge digital health technologies that could allow us to harness the potential to improve access to individualized care and generate better patient outcomes.”

Over the past year, Eko has made significant advances in improving the detection of heart failure at the point of care. In December 2019, Eko announced FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for a novel ECG-based algorithm that can identify reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), a measure commonly used to diagnose patients with heart failure. This algorithm, when cleared by the FDA, will be compatible with the DUO, Eko’s handheld stethoscope and ECG device. By leveraging artificial intelligence, everyday in-office exams can be turned into a powerful, accessible screening tool.

“Eko was founded to provide a better way to understand our heart and lung health and to improve cardiopulmonary care for patients through digital technology and novel algorithms,” said Connor Landgraf, CEO and co-founder of Eko. “Eko’s collaboration with AstraZeneca will allow us to expand the capability of our technology, generate real-world data, and explore disease management solutions while leveraging AstraZeneca’s global expertise and existing relationships across the treatment continuum for heart failure.”

About Eko

Eko is elevating the way clinicians detect and monitor cardiac and respiratory disease by bringing together advanced sensors, patient and provider software, and AI-powered analysis. Its FDA cleared platform is used by tens of thousands of clinicians treating millions of patients around the world, in-person, and through telehealth. The company is headquartered in Oakland, California and privately-held, with investments from ARTIS Ventures, NTT Venture Capital, DigiTx Ventures, Mayo Clinic, Sutter Health and others.

40721,Novartis Reports Results of Ofatumumab (OMB157) in P-III ASCLEPIOS Trials for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,Novartis announces NEJM publication of Phase III ASCLEPIOS trials demonstrating superior efficacy of ofatumumab in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis,"The two P-III studies, ASCLEPIOS I & II involves assessing of ofatumumab (20mg, monthly SC) vs teriflunomide (14mg) in 1882 patients aged 18-55yrs with MS and EDDS score b/w 0 and 5.5. The studies were conducted across 37 countries in 350+ sites 
 Results of ASCLEPIOS I & II: 51% & 58% reduction in ARR (0.11 vs 0.22 & 0.10 vs 0.25); reduction Gd+T1 lesions (97% & 94%); reduction in new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% & 85%); superior in reducing neuroaxonal damage in both studies, as measured by NfL serum concentrations; 34% and 32% risk reduction in 3mos. and 6mos. CDW; favorable trend in rate of 6mos. CDI; no difference in annual rate of brain volume loss
 Ofatumumab (SC, once monthly) is a CD20 mAb, targeting CD20 molecule on the B-cell surface and inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion with its anticipated US FDA’s approval in Sept’20 and in EU by Q2’21","Ofatumumab is a targeted B-cell therapy that delivers superior efficacy with a similar safety profile when compared with teriflunomide, a commonly prescribed oral treatment for multiple sclerosis1
ASCLEPIOS I and II demonstrated significant reductions in risk of relapses, confirmed disability worsening and profound reduction of active or new brain lesions1
The US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency are currently reviewing ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in adults
If approved, ofatumumab will be the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home and has the potential to become a first-choice treatment for use in RMS patients 
Basel, August 5, 2020 — Novartis today announced that The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published the positive results from the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab (OMB157) 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). Both studies met the primary endpoints where ofatumumab showed a significant reduction in the number of confirmed relapses, evaluated as the annualized relapse rate (ARR)1.

“ASCLEPIOS I and II demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab and its potential to become a first-choice treatment option that offers RMS patients the flexibility as they continue to live their lives,” said Krishnan Ramanathan, Neuroscience Global Program Head at Novartis. “Ofatumumab is a testament to our commitment to advance science and investigate potential treatments that reimagine care and address significant unmet needs at all parts of the RMS journey.”

Results from the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies showed that compared with teriflunomide, ofatumumab:

Significantly reduced the ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 58% (0.10 vs 0.25) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (P<.001 in both studies) (primary endpoints)1
Showed a relative risk reduction of 34% (P=.002) in 3-month confirmed disability worsening (CDW) and 32% (P=.01) in 6-month CDW in a pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS (disability-related secondary endpoints)1
Showed significant reduction of both gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) T1 lesions with a 97% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, (both P<.001), and an 82% and 85% relative reduction in new or enlarging T2 lesions in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (both P<.001) (MRI-related secondary endpoints)1
Showed superiority in reducing neuroaxonal damage in both studies, as measured by neurofilament light chain (NfL) serum concentrations (biomarker secondary endpoint)1; axonal loss, which begins at disease onset, is a detrimental consequence of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and is a major determinant of irreversible neurological disability in MS patients2
Demonstrated a favorable trend in rate of 6-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI) events but did not reach significance (disability-related secondary endpoint)1
Showed the annual rate of brain volume loss was not significantly different (MRI-related secondary endpoint)1
Demonstrated an overall safety profile similar to teriflunomide, the frequency of serious infections and neoplasms was similar across both treatment groups. Injection-related reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache, injection-site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were the most commonly observed adverse events across both treatment groups, occurring in ≥10% of patients1,3
“The ASCLEPIOS studies found that ofatumumab produced a significant reduction in new inflammation, as well as fewer clinical relapses and progression events,” said Professor Stephen L. Hauser, Director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and co-chair of the steering committee for the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies. “A separate post hoc analysis demonstrated that nearly 9 out of 10 patients experienced no evidence of disease activity in the second year of treatment4. Ofatumumab represents a potential new option for RMS patients with greater efficacy compared to teriflunomide, a comparable safety profile, and the convenience of once monthly self-administration without the need for infusions.”

These data were published in the August 6, 2020 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

In February, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted the company’s Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), respectively, for ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adults. If approved, ofatumumab will be the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home and has the potential to become a first-choice treatment for use in RMS patients.

Regulatory approval for ofatumumab in the US is expected in September 2020 and in Europe by Q2 2021. Novartis is committed to bringing ofatumumab to patients worldwide and additional regulatory filings are currently underway.

About ofatumumab
Ofatumumab (OMB157) is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in development for RMS that is self-administered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously1,3. As shown in preclinical studies, ofatumumab is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion5. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and preclinical studies have shown that it may preserve the B-cells in the spleen6. Once-monthly dosing of ofatumumab also allows faster repletion of B-cells and offers flexibility7. Ofatumumab was originally developed by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 20158.

About ASCLEPIOS I and II studies
The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies are twin, identical design, flexible duration (up to 30 months), double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with RMS. The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies enrolled 1882 patients with MS, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.51. The studies were conducted in over 350 sites in 37 countries9. Ofatumumab demonstrated a significant reduction in ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 58% (0.10 vs 0.25) compared with teriflunomide (P<.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (primary endpoint). Ofatumumab also showed a relative risk reduction of 34% (P=.002) in 3-month CDW and 32% (P=.01) in 6-month CDW compared with teriflunomide in a pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS1.

Ofatumumab showed significant reduction of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions. It significantly reduced the mean number of both Gd+ T1 lesions (97% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) and new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% and 85% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) vs teriflunomide1. Ofatumumab demonstrated that it lowered NfL levels in serum at the first assessment at Month 3 compared with teriflunomide. There was no difference in slope of brain volume change from baseline between treatments. In a measure of 6-month CDI events, a favorable trend for ofatumumab was seen but this did not reach significance vs teriflunomide1.

Ofatumumab had a similar safety profile to teriflunomide, with the frequency of serious infections and neoplasms also being similar across both treatment groups1. Injection-related reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache, injection-site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were the most commonly observed adverse events across both treatment groups, occurring in ≥10% of patients1.

Overall, ofatumumab, a fully-human antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered superior efficacy and demonstrated a safety profile with infection rates similar to teriflunomide1.

About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord10. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide11, can be characterized into four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS)12. The various forms of MS can be distinguished based on whether a patient experiences relapses (clearly defined acute inflammatory attacks of worsening neurological function), and/or whether they experience progression of neurologic damage and disability from the onset of the disease10.

Novartis in Neuroscience
Novartis has a strong ongoing commitment to neuroscience and to bringing innovative treatments to patients suffering from neurological conditions where there is a high unmet need. We are committed to supporting patients and physicians in multiple disease areas, including MS, migraine, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and have a promising pipeline in MS, Alzheimer’s disease, spinal muscular atrophy and specialty neurology.

Denali to receive a $560 million upfront payment, a $465 million equity investment and potential milestone payments, profit sharing and royalties
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Aug. 06, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Denali Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: DNLI) today announced that they have signed a binding agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Denali’s small molecule inhibitors of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) for Parkinson’s disease. Biogen will also receive rights to opt into two programs and a right of first negotiation for two additional programs, in each case for neurodegenerative diseases leveraging Denali’s Transport Vehicle (TV) technology platform to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

“Our collaboration with Denali represents an opportunity to advance the development of a potential first-in-class oral therapy that may slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease,” said Michel Vounatsos, Biogen’s Chief Executive Officer. “Denali’s LRRK2 program is highly complementary to our existing Parkinson’s disease pipeline and its successful development would enhance Biogen’s portfolio of medicines for treating serious neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. We look forward to leveraging our neurology capabilities and infrastructure with Denali’s scientific expertise to accelerate advancement of this program.”

“We are very excited to collaborate with Biogen, a company with an impressive history in inventing and developing medicines for neurological diseases,” said Ryan Watts, Ph.D., Denali’s Chief Executive Officer. “This collaboration will allow us to accelerate the development of our LRRK2 program and gives us the resources to build a fully integrated company with the goal of bringing transformative medicines to patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.”

Under the agreement, Biogen will collaborate with Denali to co-develop and co-commercialize Denali’s small molecule inhibitors of LRRK2 for Parkinson’s disease. Biogen and Denali will co-commercialize the LRRK2 product in the U.S. and China, and Biogen will commercialize in all other markets. DNL151 has been selected to progress into late stage clinical studies expected to commence in 2021.

Mutations in the LRRK2 gene can cause Parkinson’s disease. LRRK2 is a regulator of lysosomal function, which is impaired in Parkinson’s disease and may contribute to neurodegeneration. Inhibition of LRRK2 activity may slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease in patients with and without known genetic risks based on restoration of lysosomal function. People who have Parkinson’s disease experience numerous symptoms, including tremors, slow movement, muscle stiffness and impaired balance. As these symptoms become progressively worse, patients have difficulty walking, talking or completing other simple tasks. Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease with significant unmet medical needs due to the absence of approved therapies that may slow disease progression.

In addition to the LRRK2 program, Biogen will also receive an exclusive option to license two preclinical programs from Denali’s TV platform, which aims to improve brain uptake of biotherapeutics, including its Antibody Transport Vehicle (ATV): Abeta program (ATV enabled anti-amyloid beta program) and a second program utilizing its TV technology. Further, Biogen will have right of first negotiation on two additional TV-enabled therapeutics, currently at a preclinical stage, should Denali decide to seek a collaboration for such programs. Denali’s TV platform is a proprietary technology designed to effectively deliver large therapeutic molecules such as antibodies, enzymes, proteins and oligonucleotides across the BBB after intravenous administration.

Terms of the Collaboration

Under the terms of the agreement, Biogen will make an upfront payment to Denali of $560 million and make a $465 million equity investment in Denali from the purchase of 13.3 million newly issued shares of Denali common stock at approximately $34.94 per share, representing 11.2 percent of Denali’s pro-forma outstanding stock.

Should the LRRK2 program achieve certain development and commercial milestones, Denali will be eligible to receive up to $1.125 billion in potential milestone payments.

In the LRRK2 collaboration, Biogen and Denali will share responsibility and costs for global development (60 percent Biogen; 40 percent Denali), and will share responsibility and costs as well as profits and losses for commercialization in the U.S. (50 percent Biogen; 50 percent Denali) and China (60 percent Biogen; 40 percent Denali). Outside the U.S. and China, Biogen will be responsible for commercialization and pay Denali tiered royalties.

Closing of the collaboration is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S., and other customary closing conditions.

About Denali’s LRRK2 DNL151 Program

DNL151 is a small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2 invented at Denali which has completed dosing of 162 healthy volunteers in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical study and completed dosing in 25 Parkinson’s patients in a Phase 1b clinical study. Denali is currently completing further dose escalation cohorts in an expanded Phase 1 and an additional cohort in the Phase 1b study to define the full therapeutic window of the molecule. Based on the clinical data to date that has been generated in Europe, DNL151 appears to have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and has met desired target engagement goals. An Investigational New Drug application for DNL151 was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2020 and enables expansion of Denali clinical trials for DNL151 globally.

40723,Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) + Paclitaxel Fail to Meet the Primary Endpoint in P-III IMpassion131 Study for Patients with Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,Roche provides update on Phase III study of Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel for people with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,"The P-III IMpassion131 study involves assessing of Tecentriq + paclitaxel vs PBO + paclitaxel, in 651 people in a ratio (2:1) with previously untreated, inoperable, LA/ m-TNBC
 The study did not meet its 1EPs of PFS for 1L treatment of people with m-TNBC) in the PD-L1+ population. The data for 2EPs of OS showed a negative trend, however, the study was not powered for the 2EPs of OS and data were immature at the time of analysis while OS follow-up is planned to continue until the final analysis
 In the previous IMpassion130 study, Tecentriq + Abraxane demonstrated PFS benefit and, while not formally tested, showed improvements in OS for people with metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1","Basel, 06 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the Phase III IMpassion131 study, evaluating Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with paclitaxel (chemotherapy), in comparison to placebo plus paclitaxel, did not meet statistical significance on its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) for the initial (first-line) treatment of people with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), in the PD-L1-positive population.

The data for the secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) showed a negative trend, however, the study was not powered for the secondary endpoint of OS and data were immature at time of analysis. OS follow-up is planned to continue until final analysis. Safety for the Tecentriq combination appeared to be consistent with the known safety profile of the individual medicines, and no new safety signals were identified.

In the previous IMpassion130 study, Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination with Abraxane® (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound); nab-paclitaxel) demonstrated a statistically significant PFS benefit and, while not formally tested, showed clinically meaningful improvements in OS for people with metastatic TNBC whose tumours express PD-L1 (≥1%). Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is approved in over 70 countries for the treatment of adults with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC whose tumours express PD-L1 (≥1%).

“While we are disappointed by the results from the IMpassion131 study, we are grateful for all the patients, families and physicians who were involved in the study,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Today’s results underscore the need to better understand the cancer and immune system interactions, including the chemotherapy backbone and associated regimens. We remain committed to finding optimal treatments for all people living with this aggressive disease.”

Full results from IMpassion131 are being discussed with global health authorities and will be presented at a future medical meeting. The insights will also be used to inform existing and future studies in triple-negative breast cancer with Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMpassion131 study
The IMpassion131 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel, in comparison to placebo plus paclitaxel, in people with previously untreated, inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. The study enrolled 651 people who were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive Tecentriq or placebo plus paclitaxel. The primary endpoint is PFS per investigator assessment (RECIST 1.1) in the PD-L1-positive population followed by intention-to-treat (ITT) populations. Secondary endpoints include OS, objective response rate and duration of response in the PD-L1-positive and ITT populations.

About triple-negative breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women with more than 2 million diagnosed worldwide each year.1 TNBC represents ~15% of all breast cancers and is more common in women under the age of 50, compared with other forms of breast cancer.2-4 It is defined by the lack of expression and/or amplification of the targetable receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and HER2 amplification.5 Patients with metastatic TNBC generally experience rapid progression and shorter OS compared to other subtypes of breast cancer.3

About Roche in breast cancer
Roche has been advancing breast cancer research for more than 30 years with the goal of helping as many people with the disease as possible. Our medicines, along with companion diagnostic tests, have contributed to bringing breakthrough innovations in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers. As our understanding of breast cancer biology rapidly improves, we are working to identify new biomarkers and approaches to treatment for all forms of early and advanced breast cancer, including triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive.

Our targeted medicines Herceptin, Perjeta, Kadcyla and Tecentriq are continuing to transform the treatment of early and advanced HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers and, through our Tecentriq and ipatasertib clinical programmes, we hope to bring new treatment combinations to people with breast cancer, ultimately improving outcomes.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for people with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

About Roche in cancer immunotherapy

40724,AstraZeneca Collaborates with Daiichi Sankyo to Evaluate the Combination of Patritumab Deruxtecan (U3-1402) + Tagrisso for EGFR-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,Daiichi Sankyo Announces Clinical Trial Collaboration with AstraZeneca to Evaluate Patritumab Deruxtecan (U3-1402) in Combination with TAGRISSO in EGFR-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Daiichi Sankyo to conduct two-part P-I study assessing U3-1402+ Tagrisso as both a 1L and 2L dual regimen in patients with advanced or mNSCLC with an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation
 The dose-escalation part will assess the safety & tolerability of different dosing combinations of dual regimen to determine the recommended dose while the second part of the study (dose expansion) will include a 1L and 2L cohort to further evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of the regimen
 In the 1L cohort, patients will receive dual regimens and patients in the 2L cohort will be randomized in a ratio (1:1) to receive treatment with U3-1402 as monothx. or in combination with Tagrisso. 258 patients will be enrolled in the study, which will be conducted in NA, EU, and Asia including Japan","Tokyo, Basking Ridge, N.J. and Munich – (August 6, 2020) – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) to evaluate the combination of patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402), a HER3 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC), and TAGRISSO (osimertinib), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 

There are no HER3 directed therapies approved for the treatment of NSCLC or any cancer. The frequency of HER3 overexpression in EGFR-mutated NSCLC has been reported to be as high as 75 percent, and there is evidence that HER3 expression may be associated with resistance to TKIs.[1],[2]

 

“The majority of patients with activating mutations of EGFR, or EGFR-mutated NSCLC, overexpress the HER3 protein in the cancer cells, and there is evidence that HER3 expression is a passenger marker of resistance to TKIs. Clinical and preclinical data, as well as biomarker expression and resistance mechanism research, support the further evaluation of patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO as a treatment combination for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with a TKI, typically TAGRISSO,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “This clinical trial collaboration supports our goal to optimize development of patritumab deruxtecan in patients with EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC to further improve current standards of care. Daiichi Sankyo is pleased to begin this focused collaboration with AstraZeneca on this important aspect of patritumab deruxtecan development.”

 

“In this trial, we will explore a new potential way to treat patients with advanced disease by combining TAGRISSO with patritumab deruxtecan, a HER3 directed ADC,” said Cristian Massacesi, Senior Vice President, Head of Late Stage Development Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “This combination approach represents one of our strategies of addressing tumor resistance. As we work to continue maximizing the benefit TAGRISSO can bring to patients, we look forward to collaborating with Daiichi Sankyo in this new area of study.”

 

About the Study

Under the terms of the agreement, Daiichi Sankyo will sponsor and conduct a multicenter, open-label, two-part phase 1 study evaluating patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO as both a first-line and second-line combination treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation.

 

The first part of the study (dose escalation) will assess the safety and tolerability of different dosing combinations of patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO to determine the recommended combination dose. The second part of the study (dose expansion) will include a first-line and second-line cohort that will further evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of the combination. Patients enrolled in the first-line cohort will receive patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO combination treatment, and patients in the second-line cohort will be randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with patritumab deruxtecan alone or in combination with TAGRISSO. Up to 258 patients will be enrolled into the study, which will be conducted in North America, Europe, and Asia including Japan.

 

The primary study objectives for the dose escalation part of the study include the assessment of the safety and tolerability of patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO. The primary objective for the dose expansion part of the study for both cohorts is the assessment of anti-tumor activity as measured by objective response rate (ORR) and as assessed by independent central review.

 

Unmet Need in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

Lung cancer is the most common cancer and is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide with an estimated 2.1 million new cases of lung cancer in 2018 and 1.8 million deaths.[3] Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers.[4]

 

Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are among the most frequently observed genomic alterations in NSCLC, affecting approximately 14 to 30 percent of patients with NSCLC.[5] For patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, targeted therapy with EGFR TKIs offers higher response rates, overall survival and progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy.[6] However, most patients eventually develop resistance to the TKIs, and new treatment approaches including combination strategies designed to overcome TKI resistance are needed.[7]

 

About HER3

HER3 is a member of the EGFR family of tyrosine kinase receptors, which are associated with normal as well as aberrant cell proliferation and survival.2 HER3 expression has been associated with an increased incidence of metastases and reduced survival in patients with NSCLC with expression frequency reported to be as high as 75 percent.1 A majority of EGFR-mutated NSCLCs show some level of HER3 expression.[8],[9] Currently, no HER3 directed therapies are approved for NSCLC or any cancer.

 

About Patritumab Deruxtecan (U3-1402)

Patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402) is one of three lead DXd antibody drug conjugates (ADC) in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo.

 

ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, patritumab deruxtecan is comprised of a human anti-HER3 antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker. It is designed to target and deliver chemotherapy inside cancer cells that express HER3 as a cell surface antigen.

 

Patritumab deruxtecan is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 study in previously treated patients with metastatic or unresectable NSCLC. Patritumab deruxtecan is also being evaluated in a phase 1/2 study in patients with HER3 expressing metastatic breast cancer.

 

Patritumab deruxtecan is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

40725,Bausch Health to Spin off its Eye Health Business,Bausch Health to Spin off its Eye Health Business,"Bausch Health spin-off its leading eye health business into an independent publicly-traded company under the name Bausch + Lomb. The spinoff is expected to be completed in H1’21
 The spinoff will lead to the formation of two separate companies that include an eye-health company built on the iconic Bausch + Lomb brand and a diversified company with leading positions in gastroenterology, aesthetics/dermatology, neurology, and international pharmaceuticals
 Bausch + Lomb will consist of Bausch Health’s global vision care, surgical, consumer and ophthalmic Rx businesses which had generated $3.7B revenue in 2019. The other company would comprise brands across the Salix, International Rx, neurology and medical dermatology businesses that generated a revenue pf ~$4.9B in 2019","Spinoff Would Unlock Value in the Iconic Bausch + Lomb Brand and Integrated Portfolio of Eye Health Products

Transaction Will Enable BHC to Focus on Expanding Its Leadership in Gastroenterology, Aesthetics/Dermatology, Neurology and International Pharma

New Segmentation Enhances Focus and Highlights Two Highly Attractive, but Dissimilar Businesses

LAVAL, QC, Aug. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC) (“Bausch Health” or the “Company”) today announced that it intends to spin off its leading eye health business into an independent publicly traded entity (“Bausch + Lomb – NewCo”) from the remainder of Bausch Health (“BHC”). The spinoff will establish two separate companies that include:

A fully integrated, pure play eye-health company built on the iconic Bausch + Lomb brand and long history of innovation; and
A diversified pharmaceutical company with leading positions in gastroenterology, aesthetics/dermatology, neurology and international pharmaceuticals.
The benefits of separating these attractive, but disparate businesses include improved strategic focus and enhanced financial transparency to better enable stakeholders to value each business independently. The timing of the anticipated spinoff will be tied to certain conditions and approvals, and the Company’s completion of several important actions, including the reorganization of the reporting segments, which we expect to begin reporting in the first quarter of 2021.

“We are committed to taking action to unlock what we see as unrecognized value in Bausch Health shares, and we believe that separating our business into two highly focused, stand-alone companies is the way to accomplish that goal,” said Joseph C. Papa, chairman and CEO of Bausch Health. “Four years ago, we initiated a multi-phase plan, first to stabilize and then to transform Bausch Health into a company positioned to deliver long-term organic growth. We have divested approximately $4 billion of non-core assets, paid down over $8 billion of debt, resolved numerous legacy legal issues and managed a loss of exclusivity on an approximately $1.4 billion product portfolio, while also investing in R&D, new product launches­­ and core franchises with attractive growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors and management team have been working on alternatives over the last 12 months to determine how to best unlock value across our businesses, and we believe that the time is right to begin the separation process, so each business has greater flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities in their respective markets.”

Bausch + Lomb – NewCo
Bausch + Lomb – NewCo, which will consist of Bausch Health’s global vision care, surgical, consumer and ophthalmic Rx businesses, would have had 2019 revenue of approximately $3.7 billion and a CAGR of 4.1% (2017-2019). We believe that Bausch + Lomb – NewCo is well-positioned to continue delivering consistent organic revenue growth across the globe, with more than half of its sales outside of the United States. The combination of pipeline expansion and established durable eye care brands, including BAUSCH + LOMB ULTRA®, Biotrue® ONEday, LUMIFY®, Ocuvite® and PreserVision®, among others, as well as the launch of BAUSCH + LOMB INFUSE™ contact lenses, is expected to drive this growth.

BHC
BHC, which would have had 2019 revenue of approximately $4.9 billion and CAGR of 1.8% (2017-2019), will comprise a diversified portfolio of leading durable brands across the Salix, International Rx, Solta, neurology and medical dermatology businesses. Core products include XIFAXAN®, TRULANCE® and RELISTOR® for gastrointestinal diseases; JUBLIA®, DUOBRII® and Thermage® FLX for dermatologic conditions; and WELLBUTRIN® and APLENZIN® for neurological conditions.

Transaction Information
Bausch Health will need to take several steps to facilitate the completion of the spinoff. As a first step to preparing stand-alone carve-out financial statements, Bausch Health expects to report Bausch + Lomb as a separate segment beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Furthermore, there are several important internal and external considerations, approvals and conditions that will drive the ultimate timing and structure of any transaction, including, but not limited to, consideration of one-time costs; capital market conditions; determination of the pro forma capitalizations of Bausch + Lomb – NewCo and BHC; final approval by Bausch Health’s Board of Directors; receipt of applicable regulatory approvals; tax considerations, including receipt of any applicable opinions and/or rulings with respect to the Canadian and U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction; and compliance with U.S. and Canadian securities laws and stock exchange rules and any shareholder vote requirements that may be applicable. Many of these considerations, approvals and conditions will be influenced by and/or be dependent on the specific structure that is ultimately selected.

Bausch Health’s management has initiated a process to determine the future executive leadership teams for each company. As the separation process commences, the Company looks forward to providing additional information on the future management teams and Boards of Directors for both companies.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Goldman Sachs are serving as financial advisors; Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz in the United States, and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt in Canada are acting as lead legal counsels; and Davis, Polk & Wardwell is acting as tax counsel.

The company continues to progress toward a mid-year closing, anticipated Aug 03, 2020
 The EC’s approval follows the divestiture of global rights for Osurnia to treat otitis externa in dogs, WW rights of Vecoxa to prevent & treat coccidiosis in calves and lambs being sold to Merck Animal Health and the European Economic Area and UK rights to the Drontal and Profende product families with related pipeline assets being sold to Vetoquinol SA
 In addition to EC approval, Elanco has received antitrust clearance for the transaction in China, Colombia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam, and provisional clearance in Brazil","Post by: Colleen Parr Dekker

GREENFIELD, Ind. (June 8, 2020) – Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted approval of Elanco’s pending acquisition of Bayer AG’s (ETR: BAYN) animal health business. The company continues to progress toward a mid-year closing, anticipated August 3, 2020.

“Approval from the European Commission is an important milestone toward the completion of our acquisition of Bayer Animal Health,” said Jeff Simmons, president and CEO of Elanco. “As the transaction edges closer to fruition, we look forward to turning our full attention to delivering innovation and an expanded portfolio of solutions for farmers, veterinarians and pet owners across the globe. The recent months have only underscored the critical work our farmers do in delivering meat, milk, fish and eggs, and the importance of providing pet owners and veterinarians with a variety of solutions in multiple channels from telemedicine and e-commerce to direct home delivery. Combining Bayer Animal Health’s leadership in these areas better positions Elanco to deliver on these needs.”

The complementary nature of this transaction, combining Elanco’s long-standing focus on the veterinarian with Bayer’s direct-to-consumer expertise, will strengthen and accelerate the company’s Innovation, Portfolio and Productivity strategy. The transaction advances Elanco’s portfolio transformation, creating a balance between the farm animal and pet businesses. It will also expand Elanco’s omnichannel approach, substantially diversifying its pet health business into the retail and e-commerce channels as Elanco continues to determine the best methods for reaching pet owners and veterinarians.

Elanco previously announced divestiture agreements in the range of $120 million to $140 million of revenue to help advance the needed regulatory reviews. The EC’s approval is conditional on several of these proposed divestitures, including:

Divestiture of the worldwide rights for Osurnia®, a treatment for otitis externa in dogs, being sold to Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC (LON: DPH)
Divestiture of the worldwide rights for Vecoxan®, used for prevention and treatment of coccidiosis in calves and lambs being sold to Merck Animal Health (also known as MSD Animal Health).
Divestiture of European Economic Area and UK rights to the Drontal® and Profender® product families and related pipeline assets from Bayer Animal Health being sold to Vetoquinol SA (EURONEXT: VETO), a French pharmaceutical company. These products are broad-spectrum de-wormers for dogs and cats.
In addition to EC approval, Elanco has received antitrust clearance for the transaction in China, Colombia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam, and provisional clearance in Brazil. Elanco continues to cooperate with agencies in other jurisdictions. Further, Elanco fully secured financing early in the first quarter of 2020 to complete the transaction through its completed equity issuance and pricing of its Term Loan B, which will fund at deal close.

The transaction remains subject to additional regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

(July 15, 2020) – Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) today announced that the company has received unanimous approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its acquisition of Bayer Animal Health, a division of Bayer AG (ETR: BAYN). The FTC decision represents the final antitrust clearance needed to complete the transaction, which continues on track for closing at the beginning of August.

“This approval marks the near-final step in fulfilling our vision of bringing together two dedicated animal health companies focused on delivering innovation and an expanded portfolio of solutions to farmers, veterinarians and pet owners around the globe,” said Jeff Simmons, president and CEO of Elanco. “As we approach closing and look toward putting our integration plans into action, I want to thank everyone who has worked so tirelessly on this transaction, especially during these challenging times. Their hard work has positioned the combined company for success, and we look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Elanco in the very near future.”

The product is administered as a single, monthly flavored chew formulation for treatment and prevention of fleas and treatment and control of ticks. BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is expected to be available in the coming months.

BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is an important addition to the company’s parasiticide portfolio, which are extended duration flea and tick protection products that offer broad-spectrum, comprehensive parasite protection for dogs. This new product is suitable for dogs in the early stages of life to begin a regimen of monthly flea and tick protection. Pet owners now can begin their dog’s early life experience on this monthly product and have the option to easily transition to the extended duration BRAVECTO products as the dog reaches 6 months of age, helping to ensure consistent treatment and compliance.

“The approval of this additional BRAVECTO product builds on the strong foundation and body of scientific evidence that we have established over the years with our broad-spectrum, comprehensive line of parasite protection products,” said KJ Varma, BVSc, PhD, senior vice president, Research and Development, Merck Animal Health. “With BRAVECTO 1-MONTH, we have expanded our portfolio with a superior advance in the fight against parasites, as well as provided both adult dogs and puppies with flea and tick protection that delivers immediate and persistent killing activity.”

BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is also indicated for the treatment and control of Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick) infestations for one month in dogs and puppies 6 months of age and older and weighing 4.4 pounds or greater.

“Parasites pose serious animal and human health risks as fleas and ticks can transmit disease,” said Christine Royal, DVM, executive director, U.S. Companion Animal and Equine Professional Services, Merck Animal Health. “Effective protection against these parasites is essential to safeguard our pets as well as our homes. The approval of BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is an ideal start for dogs in the early stages of life with the benefit of a tasty, monthly chew formulation that is fast-acting and efficacious.”

 The vaccine is jointly developed by Boehringer and Chinese research institutes and will be produced at BI’s Taizhou plant, Jiangsu province, and is expected to be commercialized in H1’21
 The vaccine is the BI’s first swine vaccine product, developed, manufactured and distributed in China. The plant also manufactures Ingelvac PRRS MLV (live vaccine for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome)","Shanghai, China, June 10, 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim is proud to announce that its China-developed Classical Swine Fever Vaccine, Live  (C-strain, PK/WRL  Cell Line Origin) (English trade name: Ingelvac® CSF MLV) has recently obtained a “New Veterinary Drug Registration Certificate” from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China. It is the first Classical Swine Fever live vaccine jointly developed by a multinational company and Chinese research institutes. It marks another milestone for Boehringer Ingelheim’s “in China, for China”, as the company is committed to providing innovative and high-quality swine vaccines for the Chinese swine industry, as well as holistic swine disease solutions to pig farms.

Classical Swine Fever (CSF) is a highly contagious and lethal infectious disease in pigs, caused by Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV). As the disease has caused huge economic losses to the pig farming industry, it is classified as Class A Animal Disease in China. Even though massive vaccination with CSF live vaccine in China now effectively controls the outbreak of CSF, endemic and sporadic spread still exists.

Most Classical Swine Fever live vaccines currently available on the market can only be stored at -15℃ for 18 months. Cold-chain transportation, storage and dilution all need a strict temperature control. The newly approved Ingelvac® CSF MLV uses state-of-the-art microcarrier-based suspension culture and freeze-drying technologies to ensure high-titer virus, stable vaccine production process, and controllable quality. It can be stored at 2-8℃ for 24 months. This high-quality product will provide China’s pig farming industry with breakthrough immunization programs and supporting disease solutions. It will contribute to the efforts and challenge of eradicating the Classical Swine Fever in China.

Ingelvac® CSF MLV will be produced by Boehringer Ingelheim’s Taizhou plant, Jiangsu province, and it is expected to be commercialized in early 2021. It will become Boehringer Ingelheim’s first swine vaccine product, developed, manufactured and distributed in China. The Taizhou plant already manufactures Ingelvac® PRRS MLV (live vaccine for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome).

Elanco to host investor call at 8:00 a.m. EDT
GREENFIELD, Ind., (August 20, 2019) Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) today announced it has entered into an agreement with Bayer AG (ETR: BAYN) to acquire its animal health business in a transaction valued at US$7.6 billion. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, creates the second largest animal health leader while strengthening and accelerating the company’s proven Innovation, Portfolio and Productivity (IPP) strategy.
The transaction will double Elanco’s Companion Animal business, advancing the company’s intentional portfolio mix transformation and creating a balance between its Food Animal and Companion Animal segments. Elanco expects the combined organization to continue to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth, while accelerating achievement of adjusted gross margin goals and delivering double digit adjusted EBITDA margin growth.
“In our first four quarters as an independent company, we have validated the significant value creation potential from a dedicated focus on animal health and a targeted strategy,” said Jeffrey N. Simmons, president and chief executive officer of Elanco. “Joining Elanco and Bayer Animal Health strengthens and accelerates our IPP strategy, transforms our portfolio with the addition of well-known pet brands, brings an increased presence in key emerging markets, expands innovation, and accelerates our margin expansion journey. The move combines our long-standing focus on the veterinarian while meeting pet owners’ changing expectation of pet care and access to products.”
Bayer AG’s chief executive officer, Werner Baumann, added: “Our Animal Health business is among the pioneers of this sector, having built up an attractive portfolio and secured well-established market positions in the companion and farm animal segments. And now, the combination with Elanco will give rise to a leading competitor in the animal health industry, benefiting customers, employees and shareholders alike.”
The addition of Bayer Animal Health enhances all major drivers of Elanco’s IPP strategy.

Portfolio: Adding Bayer Animal Health’s business accelerates Elanco’s portfolio transformation by elevating Companion Animal to nearly half of the overall business. The combination creates access to new segments of the parasiticides market with topical treatments and collars, and propels Elanco into expanding pet e-commerce and retail spaces. This complements Elanco’s already strong veterinary presence, enabling the company to reach more pet owners. In the Food Animal business, the acquisition will add a number of anchor cattle brands, create a bio-protection portfolio and expand Elanco’s aqua presence into warm water fish. The enhanced global presence will allow Elanco to better serve veterinarians, farmers and pet owners.
Innovation: The transaction augments Elanco’s already strong R&D pipeline with eight significant new development projects and 30+ lifecycle products, while providing certain access rights to Bayer’s CropScience R&D pipeline and de-prioritized clinical pharma assets. It adds superior capabilities for R&D platforms in key areas along with innovative dosing and delivery technology platforms. The acquisition also adds additional bench strength and scale to Elanco’s world-class R&D team.
Productivity: The combination of Bayer and Elanco accelerates Elanco’s margin expansion opportunity and delivers adjusted EPS accretion in the first full year post-closing, then high single to low double-digit percentage accretion in year two. The acquisition also unlocks Elanco’s ability to achieve 60 percent adjusted gross margin and 31 percent adjusted EBITDA margin faster than on a stand-alone basis,2 with the increased ability to improve beyond. It brings operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion annually by the third year post-closing, allowing Elanco to reach 3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA in the same time period, along with the potential for $275 to $300 million in synergies. Finally, Elanco will bring together two complementary dedicated animal health businesses to operate on one fit-for-future infrastructure.
“This combination will join two complementary animal health-focused entities previously under the human pharma umbrella into a dedicated company focused on delivering for farmers, veterinarians and pet owners. It creates increased speed, attention and investment to bring customers greater access and options at a variety of price points to make a difference in the lives of animals,” Simmons said. “We look forward to adding Bayer Animal Health’s employees’ breadth of expertise. Ultimately, we believe these increased capabilities and knowledge will allow us to better support the veterinarian, creating a bridge between the pet owner and the veterinarian where relationships don’t exist today.”
Key Terms and Financing
Elanco will finance the transaction through both cash and equity. Bayer AG will receive $5.32 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, and $2.28 billion or approximately 68 million Elanco Animal Health common shares. This represents a 70 percent to 30 percent cash-to-equity mix. Stock received by Bayer is subject to a 7.5 percent symmetrical collar centered on Elanco’s volume-weighted average price for the 30 trading days ended August 6, 2019 of $33.60. Elanco has secured a bridge commitment for the cash portion of the consideration. It intends to fund the cash consideration through a combination of new debt and equity. At close, Elanco expects its gross debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be ~5x, including the benefit of expected cost synergies. The strong cash flow generation profile of the combined businesses will allow Elanco to de-lever rapidly to below 3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2022. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2020, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Advisors
Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Elanco and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Hengeler Mueller acted as legal counsel to Elanco. Elanco’s Board of Directors was provided a fairness opinion by Duff & Phelps.

41165,Cadila Pharma Launches NuPTH Biosimilar to Forteo for the Treatment of Osteoporosis in India,Cadila Pharma launches osteoporosis biosimilar in India,"Cadila has launched NuPTH an osteoporosis biosimilar of Forteo in India. The NuPTH is used for treatment of osteoporosis and in patients with increased risk of fracture. The biosimilar NuPTH aims to be cost-effective for patients and will be available as easy to use, pre-filled disposable pen
 NuPTH is the third biosimilar launched by the company following the launch of Rituximab and Bevasizumab biosimilars, recommended in multiple indications under the brand names Ritucad and Bevaro respectively
 The launch strengthens the company’s ortho care portfolio and helps in increasing choice and access for osteoporosis care to patients in the Indian Market","Ahmedabad-based Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited has announced the launch of NuPTH an Osteoporosis biosimilar of Forteo in India. The Forteo biosimilar is used for treatment of osteoporosis and in patients with increased risk of fracture.

India is the Osteoporosis capital of the world. It is a very common problem. As per a study in 2003 the number of osteoporosis patients in India were approximately 26 million. It is estimated that by 2050, half of the world’s fractures will occur in Asia.*

“Difficulty in use and early drop-outs is often cited as a common reason for non-compliance of osteoporosis medication. The medication is primarily used by people of 50 years and above. We realized that if the delivery system is complex, people stop using it. The ease of use of delivery device is as important as development of new drugs. The biosimilar NuPTH aims to be a cost effective solution for patients and will be sold as an easy to use, pre-filled disposable pen,” shared Amit Ajmera, Vice President, Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited.

“Cadila has always been committed to quality and affordable care. With the launch of NuPTH we intend to strengthen our orthocare portfolio and help increase choice, and access for osteoporosis care to patients in the Indian Market. NuPTH builds new bones with ease, and we want all patients to have access to it. Biosimilars market is a focus area for us and we will continue to strengthen our portfolio”, said Mr. O.P. Singh, President -Sales and Marketing, Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited.

NuPTH is the third biosimilar announced by the organization in the past one month. The pharma giant has recently launched Rituximab and Bevasizumab biosimilars, recommended in multiple indications under the brand names Ritucad™ and Bevaro™ respectively.

August 4 is celebrated as National bone and joint day by Indian orthopaedic association. Lack of Nutrition is often cited as the cause of brittle bones. While supplements, help in prevention of osteoporosis, the biosimilar product is the only agent which helps build new bones.

Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (www.cadilapharma.com) is one of the largest privately-held pharmaceutical companies of India. It has recently concluded and cleared USFDA inspection successfully in February 2020. Over the past six decades, Cadila Pharmaceuticals has been engaged in development and manufacturing of affordable medicines and in making them available for patients across the world. Its innovation-driven drug discovery processes ensure the health and well-being of people around the world.

41285,Roche's Evrysdi (risdiplam) Receives the US FDA's Approval for SMA in Adults and Children,FDA approves Roche’s Evrysdi (risdiplam) for treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults and children 2 months and older,"The US FDA has approved Evrysdi to treat SMA in adults and children ≥ 2mos. The approval is based on two clinical studies designed to represent a broad spectrum of people living with SMA: FIREFISH in symptomatic infants aged 2-7 mos, and SUNFISH in children and adults aged 2-25yrs.
 The two studies demonstrated improvements in motor function in people with varying ages and levels of disease severity, including Types 1, 2, and 3 SMA. The filing of MAA to EMA for the therapy is imminent while the therapy has been filed in Brazil, Chile, China, Indonesia, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan
 Roche leads the clinical development of Evrysdi as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics and is the only therapy for SMA that can be taken at home. It will be available in the US within 2wks. for direct delivery to patients’ homes through Accredo Health Group","In two clinical trials, Evrysdi improved motor function in people living with SMA over a broad spectrum of ages and levels of disease severity, including Types 1, 2, and 3 SMA
Evrysdi helped infants survive without permanent ventilation and achieve the ability to sit without support, a key motor milestone not normally seen in the natural course of the disease
Evrysdi is the first and only medicine for SMA that can be taken at home
 
Basel, 10 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) Roche announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults and children 2 months of age and older. Evrysdi showed clinically-meaningful improvements in motor function across two clinical trials in people with varying ages and levels of disease severity, including Types 1, 2, and 3 SMA. Infants achieved the ability to sit without support for at least 5 seconds, a key motor milestone not normally seen in the natural course of the disease. Evrysdi also improved survival without permanent ventilation at 12 and 23 months, compared to natural history. A liquid medicine, Evrysdi is administered daily at home by mouth or feeding tube.

“Given the majority of people with SMA in the U.S. remain untreated, we believe Evrysdi, with its favorable clinical profile and oral administration, may offer meaningful benefits for many living with this rare neurological disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph. D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “The strength and resolve of the SMA community has continually inspired us as we developed this first-of-its-kind medicine for SMA, so today we celebrate our collective accomplishment together with them.”

Evrysdi is being studied in more than 450 people as part of a large and robust clinical trial program in SMA. The program includes infants aged 2 months to adults aged 60 with varying symptoms and motor function, such as people with scoliosis or joint contractures, and those previously treated for SMA with another medication. The approval is based on data from two clinical studies designed to represent a broad spectrum of people living with SMA: FIREFISH in symptomatic infants aged 2 to 7 months; and SUNFISH in children and adults aged 2 to 25 years. SUNFISH is the first and only placebo-controlled trial to include adults with Types 2 and 3 SMA.

In FIREFISH, 41% (7/17) of infants treated with the therapeutic dose achieved the ability to sit without support for at least 5 seconds as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (BSID-III). Additionally, 90% (19/21) of infants were alive without permanent ventilation at 12 months of treatment and reached 15 months of age or older. As described in the natural history of untreated infantile-onset SMA, infants would not be expected to be able to sit independently, and only 25 percent would be expected to survive without permanent ventilation beyond 14 months of age. In SUNFISH, children and adults treated with Evrysdi experienced a clinically-meaningful and statistically significant improvement in motor function at 12 months (1.55 point mean difference; p=0.0156) compared to placebo (1.36 points [95% CI: 0.61, 2.11]; -0.19 points [95% CI: -1.22, 0.84], respectively), as measured by a change from baseline in the Motor Function Measure-32 (MFM-32) total score.

Evrysdi demonstrated a favorable efficacy and safety profile, with the safety profile established across the FIREFISH and SUNFISH trials. The most common adverse reactions were fever, diarrhea, and rash in later-onset SMA. In infantile-onset SMA, the most common adverse events were similar and also included upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation, and vomiting. There were no treatment-related safety findings leading to withdrawal from either study.

“Throughout their lives, many people with SMA may lose their ability to perform critical movements, which can impact the ability to independently participate in aspects of daily life and even be life altering,” said Kenneth Hobby, president of Cure SMA. “The approval of Evrysdi is an eagerly awaited milestone for our community. We appreciate Genentech/Roche’s commitment to reflecting the full scope of the real-world SMA population in their clinical trial program and developing a treatment that can be administered at home.”

Evrysdi is designed to treat SMA by increasing production of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement. Roche leads the clinical development of Evrysdi as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.

Evrysdi will be available in the United States within two weeks for direct delivery to patients’ homes through Accredo Health Group Inc., an Express Scripts specialty pharmacy.

About Evrysdi™ (risdiplam)
Evrysdi is a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Evrysdi is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or by feeding tube.

Risdiplam was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by FDA and EMA in 2017 and 2019, respectively. At this time, risdiplam has been filed in Brazil, Chile, China, Indonesia, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan. A Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) submission to the EMA for Evrysdi is imminent.

About the Pivotal Studies
FIREFISH (NCT02913482)
FIREFISH, an open-label, two-part pivotal study, was designed to assess Evrysdi safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in patients aged 1 to 7 months with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 evaluated several doses of Evrysdi and determined the therapeutic dose of 0.2 mg/kg for Part 2. In Part 1, after 12 months of Evrysdi treatment:

41% (7/17) of infants treated with the therapeutic dose achieved the ability to sit without support for at least 5 seconds as measured by the BSID-III gross motor scale.
90% (19/21) of all infants were alive without permanent ventilation* and reached 15 months of age or older
81% (17/21) of all patients were alive without permanent ventilation* after a minimum of 23 months of treatment and reached an age of 28 months or older (median 32 months; range 28 to 45 months)
* Permanent ventilation defined as tracheostomy or ≥16 hours of noninvasive ventilation per day or intubation for ≥21 consecutive days in the absence of, or following the resolution of, an acute reversible event.

SUNFISH (NCT02908685)
SUNFISH, a two-part placebo-controlled multicenter pivotal trial, was designed to assess Evrysdi safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and PD in people with Type 2 or 3 SMA aged 2 to 25, including those with scoliosis (67% in Part 2) and joint contractures at baseline. In Part 2, after 12 months, Evrysdi treatment led to:

A clinically-meaningful and statistically significant improvement in motor function among children and adults, as measured by a change from baseline in the MFM-32 total score (1.55 point mean difference; p=0.0156), at 12 months as compared to placebo (1.36 points [95% CI: 0.61, 2.11]; -0.19 points [95% CI: 1.22, 0.84], respectively). MFM-32 assesses 32 different motor functions across a wide range of people with SMA.
Improved upper limb motor function compared to baseline, as measured by the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), a secondary independent motor function endpoint of the study (1.59 point difference; p=0.0028).
Pivotal Trial Safety Data
The safety profile of Evrysdi was established across the FIREFISH and SUNFISH pivotal trials. The most common adverse reactions in later-onset SMA (incidence of at least 10% of patients treated with Evrysdi and more frequently than control) were fever, diarrhea, and rash. The most common adverse reactions in infantile-onset SMA were similar to those observed in later-onset SMA patients. Additionally, the most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 10%) were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation, and vomiting.

About the Evrysdi Clinical Trial Program
In addition to FIREFISH and SUNFISH, Evrysdi is being evaluated in a broad range of people with SMA, including in:

JEWELFISH (NCT03032172): an open-label exploratory trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years who received other investigational or approved SMA therapies for at least 90 days prior to receiving Evrysdi. Recruitment for this study is complete with 174 people enrolled.
RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334): an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Evrysdi in infants (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.

About SMA
SMA is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It affects approximately one in 10,000 babies and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by a mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leads to a deficiency of SMN protein. This protein is found throughout the body and is essential to the function of nerves that control muscles and movement. Without it, nerve cells cannot function correctly, leading to muscle weakness over time. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

41316,The US FDA Approves Guardant360 CDx as the First Liquid Biopsy NGS Assay to Identify EGFR Mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,FDA Approves First Liquid Biopsy Next-Generation Sequencing Companion Diagnostic Test,"The FDA has approved Guardant360 CDx as a liquid biopsy companion diagnostic that uses NGS to identify EGFR mutations in patients with metastatic NSCLC
 The assay utilizes two technologies- i) liquid biopsy that uses a blood sample to provide HCPs with genetic information about the patient’s tumor and ii) NGS that uses large-panel genetic sequencing, allowing clinicians to better assess tumor composition
 Today’s approval is specific to its use in identifying NSCLC patients with EGFR alterations who may benefit from AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso. The assay has also received FDA’s breakthrough device designation","SILVER SPRING, Md., Aug. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first liquid biopsy companion diagnostic that also uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to identify patients with specific types of mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in a deadly form of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This is the first approval to combine two technologies — NGS and liquid biopsy — in one diagnostic test in order to guide treatment decisions.

“Approval of a companion diagnostic that uses a liquid biopsy and leverages next-generation sequencing marks a new era for mutation testing,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.  “In addition to benefitting from less invasive testing, patients are provided with a simultaneous mapping of multiple biomarkers of genomic alterations, rather than one biomarker at a time, which can translate to decreased wait times for starting treatment and provide insight into possible resistance mechanisms.”

The Guardant360 CDx assay utilizes two technologies. The first is called liquid biopsy, which uses a blood sample to provide health care professionals with genetic information about the patient’s tumor. It is less invasive and more easily repeatable in comparison to standard tissue biopsies. Furthermore, liquid biopsy tests can be used in cases in which standard tissue biopsies are not feasible, for instance, due to the location of the tumor.

The second technology is NGS, which uses large-panel genetic sequencing, known as high-throughput tumor profiling. Compared to older technologies that required multiple tests, NGS requires only one test and allows clinicians to better assess tumor composition, giving providers an advantage in evaluating which mutations are problematic. The Guardant360 CDx assay uses NGS technology to simultaneously detect mutations in 55 tumor genes, rather than one gene at a time.

While the Guardant360CDx can provide information on multiple solid tumor biomarkers, today’s approval is specific to its use in identifying EGFR mutations in patients who will benefit from treatment with TAGRISSO (osimertinib), an FDA-approved therapy for a form of metastatic NSCLC. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women in the United States, and NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer. Genomic findings for other biomarkers evaluated are not validated for choosing a particular corresponding treatment with this approval. If the specific NSCLC mutations associated with today’s approval are not detected in the blood, then a tumor biopsy should be performed to determine if the NSCLC mutations are present.

The Guardant360 CDx assay was granted a Breakthrough Device designation, in which the FDA provides intensive interaction and guidance to the company on efficient device development.

The FDA granted approval for the Guardant360 CDx test to Guardant Health.

In the HICKORY study, in patients with prior anti-TNF treatment, therapy met its 1EPs at induction but not at maintenance
 In the LAUREL maintenance study in people without prior anti-TNF treatment, etrolizumab failed to meet its 1EPs while the safety profile of therapy was consistent with previous studies and no major safety issues were reported till date in the four P-III studies
 The therapy is currently being evaluated as an induction/maintenance treatment in people with mod. to sev. active CD with/out prior anti-TNF treatment in a global P-III study (BERGAMOT) and OLE and safety monitoring study (JUNIPER), involving 1,100+ people with CD. In addition, Roche is studying other therapies in IBD and is committed to further understanding this disease","Etrolizumab met its primary endpoint of inducing remission versus placebo for people with ulcerative colitis in only two of three studies
Etrolizumab failed to meet its primary endpoint versus placebo as maintenance therapy in people with ulcerative colitis
Analyses of these data are ongoing to better understand the results
Pivotal phase III study of etrolizumab in Crohn’s disease is ongoing
Roche is studying additional investigational medicines in inflammatory bowel diseases
Basel, 10 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced topline results from its phase III study programme evaluating the investigational medicine etrolizumab in people with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Mixed results were seen in studies evaluating etrolizumab as an induction therapy, and both studies evaluating etrolizumab as a maintenance therapy failed to meet their primary endpoints, showing no significant difference in the proportion of people achieving remission with subcutaneous etrolizumab versus placebo.

In the HIBISCUS I induction study, in people without prior anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment, etrolizumab met the primary endpoint. In contrast, the HIBISCUS II induction study, which also included people without prior anti-TNF treatment, did not meet its primary endpoint. In the HICKORY study, in people with prior anti-TNF treatment, etrolizumab met the primary endpoint at induction but not at maintenance. In the LAUREL maintenance study in people without prior anti-TNF treatment, etrolizumab failed to meet its primary endpoint. The safety profile of etrolizumab was consistent with previous studies and no major safety issues were identified in the four phase III clinical trials reported to date.

“We are disappointed with these results, because we know that people with ulcerative colitis need new treatment options,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are fully analysing these data to learn more about how we might address the needs of people with this devastating disease. These studies were part of the largest clinical trial programme ever undertaken in inflammatory bowel diseases, and we thank all the patients, investigators and healthcare professionals for their participation.”

Further analyses of the data, including secondary endpoints, are ongoing and will be submitted for presentation at upcoming medical meetings.

Etrolizumab continues to be studied as an investigational induction and maintenance treatment in people with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease with and without prior anti-TNF treatment in a global phase III study (BERGAMOT) and open-label extension and safety monitoring study (JUNIPER), involving more than 1,100 people with Crohn’s disease. In addition, Roche is studying other investigational medicines in inflammatory bowel diseases and is committed to further understanding this disease.

About inflammatory bowel diseases and ulcerative colitis
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of chronic gastrointestinal disorders affecting almost 7 million people worldwide.1 The two main types of IBD are ulcerative colitis (mainly affecting the colon and rectum) and Crohn’s disease (affecting the entire gastrointestinal tract).2,3 Patients can experience unpredictable symptoms that include abdominal pain and cramping, frequent and urgent bowel movements, diarrhoea, leakage, rectal bleeding, weight loss, energy loss and fatigue.2,3 About 80% of all individuals with IBD do not experience lasting remission, which can have a long-term impact on quality of life and leave many feeling like they have little control over their daily lives.4

Ulcerative colitis is most commonly diagnosed in young people aged 15 to 30 years, affecting them over the course of their entire future lives.5 Up to a quarter of people with ulcerative colitis will require a colectomy within 10 years of diagnosis, in which all or part of the colon is removed.6

About etrolizumab
Etrolizumab is the first investigational dual anti-integrin studied in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). It is designed to target IBD on two fronts by selectively inhibiting α4β7 and αEβ7 to control both trafficking of immune cells into the gut and their inflammatory effects on the gut lining.7

About the etrolizumab study programme
Etrolizumab is being studied in the largest clinical trial programme in inflammatory bowel diseases to date, comprised of eight randomised-controlled and open-label trials.8-15 The landmark study programme includes more than 3,100 patients across six phase III studies, plus two open-label extension (OLE) and safety monitoring studies for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, spanning more than 40 countries globally, including head-to-head trials against the most common current treatments.

The etrolizumab study programme consists of:

Phase III HIBISCUS I and II: Two identical, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies evaluating the efficacy (induction of remission) and safety of etrolizumab versus adalimumab and placebo in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have not been previously treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents8,9
Phase III LAUREL: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study evaluating the efficacy (maintenance of remission) and safety of etrolizumab in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have not been previously treated with anti-TNF agents10
Phase III GARDENIA: Randomised, multicentre double-blind, double-dummy study evaluating the efficacy (sustained remission) and safety of etrolizumab versus infliximab in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have not been previously treated with anti-TNF agents11
Phase III HICKORY: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of etrolizumab during induction and maintenance in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have been previously treated with anti-TNF agents12
COTTONWOOD study: An open-label extension and safety monitoring study of patients with moderately to severely ulcerative colitis previously enrolled in etrolizumab phase II/III studies13
Phase III BERGAMOT: A phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of etrolizumab as an induction and maintenance treatment in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease14
JUNIPER study: An open-label extension and safety monitoring study of patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease previously enrolled in the etrolizumab phase III BERGAMOT study15

“Since the beginning of the pandemic, Gilead has worked with urgency to establish the efficacy and safety profile of Veklury, and we now have a robust data set supporting the evaluation of use of the drug across a range of hospitalized COVID-19 patient populations,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “Today’s filing is an important milestone as we continue to partner with the U.S. government and healthcare authorities around the globe to address the treatment needs of patients with COVID-19.”

Veklury has been approved by multiple regulatory authorities around the world, including in the European Union and Japan. In countries where Veklury has not been approved, including the United States, Veklury is an investigational drug and the safety and efficacy of remdesivir have not been established. Please see below for additional important warnings and information about the authorized use of Veklury in the United States.

About Veklury

Veklury (remdesivir) is an investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens. Multiple ongoing international Phase 3 clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of Veklury for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, in different patient populations, formulations, and in combination with other therapies.

Important Information about Veklury in the United States

In the United States, Veklury (remdesivir) is authorized for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) only for the treatment of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. Severe disease is defined as patients with an oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen or requiring mechanical ventilation or requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Veklury must be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion and is supplied two ways: Veklury (remdesivir) for injection, 100 mg, lyophilized powder, or Veklury (remdesivir) injection, 100 mg/20 mL (5 mg/mL), concentrated solution.

Veklury is an investigational drug that has not been approved by the FDA for any use, and the safety and efficacy of Veklury for the treatment of COVID-19 have not been established. This authorization is temporary and may be revoked, and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process. For information about the authorized use of Veklury and mandatory requirements of the EUA in the U.S., please review the Fact Sheets and FDA Letter of Authorization available at www.gilead.com/remdesivir.

There are limited clinical data available for Veklury. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with Veklury use. Hypersensitivity reactions, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, have been observed during and following administration of Veklury. The use of Veklury is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to remdesivir. Transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers and patients with COVID-19 in clinical trials who received Veklury. Patients should have appropriate clinical and laboratory monitoring to aid in early detection of any potential adverse events. Monitor renal and hepatic function prior to initiating and daily during therapy with Veklury; additionally monitor serum chemistries and hematology daily during therapy. Do not initiate Veklury in patients with ALT ≥5x ULN or with an eGFR <30 mL/min. The decision to continue or discontinue Veklury therapy after development of an adverse event should be made based on the clinical risk/benefit assessment for the individual patient.

Due to a risk of reduced antiviral activity, coadministration of Veklury and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended.

Healthcare providers and/or their designee are responsible for mandatory FDA MedWatch reporting of all medication errors and serious adverse events or deaths occurring during Veklury treatment and considered to be potentially attributable to Veklury. These events must be reported within 7 calendar days from the onset of the event. MedWatch adverse event reports can be submitted to FDA online at www.fda.gov/medwatch or by calling 1-800-FDA-1088.

41337,Olympus to Acquire Arc Medical Design for Expanding its Product Portfolio,Olympus announces acquisition of Arc Medical Design Limited from Norgine B.V.,"The acquisition will expand Olympus’ offerings in GI therapeutic devices and the development of advanced colonoscopy tools with the aim of improving early detection and treatment of CRC
 Olympus will obtain full rights to Arc Medical Design’s medical products and will convert its current exclusive distribution rights of Endocuff Vision to a full acquisition of the Endocuff family of products
 Endocuff Vision is a device attached to the distal end of a colonoscope, designed to maintain and maximize visibility during colonoscopy. The Endocuff technology will increase the 11% ADR that will improve clinical outcomes, reduce overall costs and enhance QoL for patients","Tokyo, August 7, 2020 – Olympus Corporation today announced it has signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Arc Medical Design Limited (Arc Medical Design), a
subsidiary of Norgine B.V. The acquisition underscores Olympus’ commitment to
expanding its offering in gastrointestinal therapeutic devices and the development of
advanced colonoscopy tools through M&A (mergers and acquisitions) opportunities as
well as through R&D (research and development) with the overarching goal of
improving early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC).
Under the agreement Olympus will acquire Arc Medical Design and obtain full rights to its suite
of innovative medical products. Olympus will convert its current exclusive distribution rights of
ENDOCUFF VISION™ to a full acquisition of the ENDOCUFF family of products, which also
includes ENDOCUFF™, ENDOCUFF GLIDE™ and ENTEROCUFF™, as well as WIDEEYE™ POLYTRAP and several products currently in development.
By acquiring Arc Medical Design, Olympus is assuming worldwide responsibility for design,
manufacturing, distribution and business strategy for the product portfolio with an immediate
effect. It will further enable the company to improve clinical outcomes, reduce overall costs and
enhance quality of life for patients.
“It is a great pleasure to announce our acquisition of Arc Medical Design”, said Mike
Callaghan, Vice President/General Manager of Global GI EndoTherapy Business Unit at
Olympus. “ENDOCUFF VISION has been a pivotal tool in our EndoTherapy portfolio, and we
are delighted to expand our product portfolio to include the entire ENDOCUFF family.”
The flagship product ENDOCUFF VISION is a
device attached to the distal end of a colonoscope,
designed to maintain and maximize visibility during
colonoscopy. Through its unique design,
ENDOCUFF VISION can manipulate large folds,
anchor the scope tip during loop reduction and
stabilize during complex procedures, such as a
polypectomy.
Data has shown a colonoscopy with ENDOCUFF technology can increase the adenoma
detection rate (ADR) by up to 11% compared to a standard colonoscopy*1. Research shows
ENDOCUFF VISION™
– 2 –
that, for every 1% increase in ADR, there is a 3% decrease in CRC risk*2. Higher detection
rates and more accurate diagnosis could, therefore, help reduce the number of deaths from
preventable digestive cancers, such as CRC. CRC is a leading cause of cancer death for both
men and women and screening is one of the powerful weapons against the disease.
Colonoscopy is considered the beneficial method for detection and removal of hard-to-find
adenomatous polyps.
Callaghan sums up: “We are excited about the acquisition of Arc Medical Design as it expands
our expertise in innovative medical technology, strengthens our global leadership in endoscopy
and reinforces the commitment to our purpose of making people’s lives healthier, safer and
more fulfilling.”

Reinforces Bayer’s position in Women’s Healthcare
Upfront consideration of $425 million and additional potential consideration in the form of milestone payments
August 11, 2020 03:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time
WHIPPANY, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bayer®, a leader in women’s healthcare, and KaNDy Therapeutics Ltd, a UK clinical-stage biotech company, announced today that Bayer will acquire KaNDy Therapeutics Ltd. to expand its drug development pipeline in women’s healthcare. KaNDy Therapeutics Ltd. recently completed and published the Phase IIb dose range finding study results for its’ investigational compound, NT-814, a potential first in class, orally administered once-daily, neurokinin-1,3 receptor antagonist which showed positive findings for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. The start of Phase III clinical trial is expected for 2021. Once approved, the compound could generate peak sales potential of more than €1 billion globally.

Up to 75% of women, over the age of 50, going through menopausal transition, experience menopausal vasomotor symptoms.1 These symptoms can be debilitating for several years for those affected and may result in significant incremental healthcare and economic costs.2

Under the terms of the agreement Bayer will pay an upfront consideration of $425 million, potential milestone payments of up to $450 million until launch followed by potential additional triple digit million sales milestone payments. Closing is subject to customary conditions, in particular anti-trust approval, and is expected by September 2020.

“As a leader in Women’s Health, Bayer is focused on providing new options for women and their healthcare needs,” said Dr. Sebastian Guth, Bayer’s President of Pharmaceuticals, Americas Region. “This acquisition is another testament to our commitment to the health of women, which not only broadens our pipeline, but has the potential, if approved, to deliver a new treatment option that could have a meaningful impact on women’s lives.”

“Bayer has been our preferred partner due to its leading position in the area of women’s healthcare”, said Dr. Mary Kerr, Co-Founder and CEO of KaNDy Therapeutics Ltd.. “We believe that under the ownership of Bayer, this potential first in class medicine can be optimally developed to become an important non-hormonal treatment option for women suffering vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.”

The acquisition of KaNDy Therapeutics Ltd. is another important milestone in augmenting Bayer’s own women’s healthcare portfolio through strategic collaborations and agreements. Earlier in 2020, Bayer announced the expansion of its partnership with Evotec with a new five-year, multi-target collaboration to develop multiple clinical candidates for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most frequent endocrine disorder in pre-menopausal women. Also, in January 2020, Bayer signed an exclusive license agreement with Daré Bioscience for the U.S. market, focused on its investigational, hormone-free, monthly vaginal contraceptive currently in clinical development for the prevention of pregnancy.

The Pharmaceuticals Business Development & Licensing team of Bayer facilitated this collaboration.

Morgan Stanley is serving as financial advisor to Bayer, while Linklaters is serving as legal counsel. Goldman Sachs International is serving as financial advisor to KaNDy Therapeutics Ltd., while Goodwin is serving as legal counsel.

 The study met its 1EPs & 2EPS, demonstrating OS, PFS, and ORR for the dual immunotherapy. @12.7mos. follow up mOS (15.6 mos. vs 10.9 mos.)
 The approval marks the availability of the first dual immuno-oncology in NSCLC treatment in Canada","CheckMate -9LA trial results demonstrated superior overall survival versus chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 expression or tumor histology1

MONTREAL, Aug. 11, 2020 /CNW/ – Today, Bristol Myers Squibb Canada (BMS) announces Health Canada’s approval of OPDIVO® (nivolumab) in combination with YERVOY® (ipilimumab) with two cycles of platinum-double chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) or Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) tumour aberrations and no prior systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC.1  Unlike traditional cancer therapies that target the tumour directly, immuno-oncology activates the body’s own immune system to help recognize and attack cancer cells.2 This approval marks the availability of the first dual immuno-oncology plus limited course chemotherapy NSCLC treatment in Canada.

“Despite NSCLC being the most common form of lung cancer, every patient’s lung cancer and treatment journey is unique,” says Dr. Rosalyn Juergens, Associate Professor at McMaster University in the Department of Oncology, Division of Medical Oncology. “This approval provides a novel dual immuno-oncology-based option that may provide longer survival for patients within the Canadian treatment landscape.”

The Health Canada approval was based on results from the randomised phase III clinical trial CheckMate -9LA. The study met both its primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating superior overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) for the dual immunotherapy plus limited chemotherapy combination versus chemotherapy alone.

Study results showed a statistically significant improvement in OS for metastatic NSCLC patients treated with OPDIVO®, YERVOY® and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone at a prespecified interim analysis (at a minimum follow-up of 8.1 months, [HR 0.69; 96.71% CI: 0.55, 0.87; p=0.0006]).3 With longer follow-up (minimum of 12.7 months), the dual immunotherapy with two cycles of chemotherapy continued to show sustained overall survival (OS) improvements over chemotherapy alone (median OS of 15.6 months versus 10.9 months, respectively [HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.80]). 3

“Over four years ago, OPDIVO® became the first immunotherapy approved for use in previously treated patients, defining a new era and changing the way NSCLC is treated. We are so proud to build on this legacy as OPDIVO® plus YERVOY® is approved as the first dual immunotherapy in a first-line NSCLC setting,” said Al Reba, General Manager, BMS Canada. “We are committed to pursuing innovative approaches to lung cancer treatment so we can continue to deliver the right medicines for patients, increase their quality of life, and improve their chances of survival.”

“Receiving a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer is devastating,” says Shem Singh, Executive Director, Lung Cancer Canada. “We welcome this new Health Canada approval for a novel treatment regimen for patients where there is still significant unmet need.”

CheckMate -9LA Study Design 
CheckMate -9LA (NCT03215706) is Phase III, randomized open-label, multi-centre study evaluating OPDIVO® plus YERVOY® combined with two cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (four cycles followed by optional pemetrexed maintenance therapy if eligible) as a first-line treatment in patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression and histology.

The study demonstrated improvement in PFS with no new safety signals
 Additionally, the therapy in combination with CT has met its 1EPs in ORIENT-11 study in 1L non-squamous NSCLC patients. Today’s acceptance marks the second sNDA of Tyvyt for 1L NSCLC indication","SUZHOU, China, Aug. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (“Innovent”) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today jointly announced with Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”,NYSE: LLY) that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China has accepted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum as first-line therapy in squamous non-small cell lung cancer (squamous NSCLC). Recently, the NMPA accepted sNDA for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) as first-line therapy in non-squamous NSCLC on Apr 23, 2020.

The sNDA was based on the analysis of a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study (ORIENT-12)—TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) or placebo in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum as first-line therapy for advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. Based on the analysis conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum, which met the pre-defined efficacy criteria. The safety profile is consistent with previously reported sintilimab studies, and no new safety signals were identified. Detailed data will be released in an upcoming international academic conference and journal.

Professor Caicun Zhou, Head of Department of Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, stated: “We are pleased to see that sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy has met predefined primary endpoint in ORIENT-12 study. There still exists large unmet medical needs in squamous NSCLC patients. Globally, ORIENT-12 has demonstrated for the first time survival benefit by treatment with PD-1 inhibitor in combination with gemcitabine and platinum in first-line squamous NSCLC. The result of this study has great clinical value.”

Dr. Hui ZHOU, Vice President of Medical Science and Strategy Oncology of Innovent, stated: “For Innovent, this is the second double-blind, randomized Phase 3 study of NSCLC that met primary endpoint following ORIENT-11, a randomized Phase 3 study of 1L non-squamous NSCLC (NCT03607539). This is also the second sNDA of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) for first-line NSCLC indication. The acceptance of the sNDA by NMPA represents further progress in covering first-line NSCLC disease area. We will actively cooperate with the regulatory authority to bring the high quality therapy to more patients with advanced squamous NSCLC as soon as possible.”

“Lilly and Innovent are committed to bring new anti-tumor treatments, developed with global standards, to patients in China. TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) is the first success of this partnership. After being included in the NRDL for relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, the acceptance of the sNDA for new indication of NSCLC is another important milestone of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in the field of oncology therapy,” said Dr. Li WANG, Senior Vice-President of Lilly China and Head of Lilly China Drug Development and Medical Affairs. “ORIENT-12 provides new combination option of chemotherapy for squamous NSCLC patients and we look forward to bringing this new treatment solution to lung cancer patients in China as soon as possible. In the future, we will continue to strengthen cooperation with Innovent to further explore TYVYT® (sintilimab injection)’s potential in the field of immuno-oncology therapy and the potential benefits TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) may bring to more patients.”

About squamous NSCLC

Lung cancer is a malignancy with the highest morbidity and mortality in China. NSCLC accounts for approximately 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnosis. About 70% of NSCLC are locally advanced or metastatic at initial diagnosis, rendering the patients with no chance of radical resection. Meanwhile, even after radical surgery the patients still have a high chance of recurrence and eventually die from disease progression. About 35% of patients with NSCLC in China are of squamous subtype without driver genes. There are limited treatment options available to them.

About ORIENT-12 Study

ORIENT-12 is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) or placebo in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum as first-line therapy for advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03629925). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by Independent Radiographic Review Committee based on RECIST v1.1. The key secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and safety profiles.

 Emactuzumab (RG7155) is an IgG1 mAb, designed to target and deplete macrophages in the tumor tissue. The therapy targets TAMs by binding to CSF-1R on the cell surface and blocking its activation by CSF-1","Oxford, 12th August 2020 – Celleron Therapeutics, the UK-based company developing novel medicines for cancer patients, today announced the signing of a licensing agreement with Roche providing Celleron exclusive world-wide rights for the clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of emactuzumab. The closing is expected by end of 2020 after all conditions have been met.
This license agreement of emactuzumab demonstrates Celleron’s commitment to cancer medicine development and its transformational potential for patients inflicted with cancer. Emactuzumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to target and deplete macrophages in the tumor tissue. It has shown a favourable safety profile in patients and very encouraging efficacy for diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumour (TGCT), a rare disease characterised by the proliferation of macrophages in the synovial tissue in the joint and tendon sheath.

Professor Nick La Thangue, Chief Executive Officer of Celleron Therapeutics, commented: “We are very excited to be working on emactuzumab. Celleron’s commitment to developing transformative and novel therapies will ultimately allow emactuzumab to be brought to patients suffering from TGCT, which remains a very debilitating disease with limited clinical options.”

About emactuzumab

Emactuzumab (RG7155) is an investigational monoclonal IgG1 antibody designed to target and deplete tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumour tissue. TAMs are an abundant component of the tumour microenvironment of many tumour types supporting tumorigenesis by suppressing the local immune system and promoting growth of tumour cells.  Emactuzumab specifically targets TAMs by binding to colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) on the cell surface and blocking its activation by CSF-1. Emactuzumab therapy has been shown to significantly reduce CSF-1 dependent macrophages in tenosynovial giant cell tumour (TGCT) and in tumours of cancer patients.

About tenosynovial giant cell tumour

Tenosynovial giant cell tumour is a rare disease characterized by proliferation of synovial tissue in the joint and tendon sheath. The neoplastic process is driven by a specific genetic translocation leading to the overexpression of CSF-1 and a massive recruitment of CSF-1R-expressing macrophages that form the bulk tumorous mass. Even though the disease rarely metastasizes, it is locally aggressive and disabling. Patients are usually diagnosed at an age between 20 and 50 with equal sex distribution. Standard therapy is surgery but relapse rates are high. Patient’s quality of life is often impacted by tumour-related symptoms and surgical sequelae.

41504,Regeneron Reports the US FDA's Acceptance of Evinacumab's BLA for Priority Review as a Treatment for Patients with HoFH,"FDA Accepts Evinacumab Biologics License Application for Priority Review as a Treatment for Patients with HoFH, an Ultra-rare Inherited Form of High Cholesterol","The BLA is based on P-III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of evinacumab (15 mg/kg, IV, q4w) in 65 patients aged ≥12yrs. with HoFH. The 1EPs of the study is reduction of LDL-C from baseline
 The expected PDUFA date for the therapy as Feb 11, 2021. The US FDA has granted BT designation to the therapy for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in patients with HoFH in 2017
 Evinacumab is an investigational mAb that binds to and blocks the function of ANGPTL3 and is currently being studied in patients with HoFH (ongoing P-III extension trial), refractory hypercholesterolemia (P-II) and severe hypertriglyceridemia (P-II)","Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia affects approximately 1,300 patients in the U.S., the vast majority of whom are unable to reach target LDL-C levels with currently available therapies

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review a Biologics License Application (BLA) for evinacumab as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). Evinacumab is the first investigational medicine of its kind to show efficacy in patients with HoFH – including patients with little to no low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor function – by binding to and blocking the function of angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3).

The target action date for the FDA decision is February 11, 2021. The FDA granted evinacumab Breakthrough Therapy designation in 2017 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in patients with HoFH.

HoFH is an ultra-rare inherited disease that affects approximately 1,300 patients in the U.S. Patients with HoFH have severely elevated levels of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C), which increases their risk for premature atherosclerotic disease and cardiac events as early as their teenage years. Treatment guidelines recommend early and intensive LDL-C lowering, but patients with HoFH are less responsive (or unresponsive) to standard lipid-lowering therapies, including statins and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors.

The BLA was supported by a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of evinacumab in patients with HoFH. Results from this trial were presented as a late-breaking presentation at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Session together with World Congress of Cardiology (ACC.20) in March 2020.

Previous research published in NEJM in 2017 by the Regeneron Genetics Center found that patients with loss-of-function mutations in their ANGPTL3 gene have significantly lower levels of key blood lipids, including LDL-C. By blocking the ANGPTL3 protein, evinacumab was designed to replicate this loss-of-function mutation effect to lower LDL-C in patients with HoFH.

Regulatory submissions for evinacumab are also progressing in the European Union. In June 2020, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended an accelerated assessment for evinacumab based on the high unmet medical need and therapeutic innovation demonstrated by the product. The safety and efficacy of evinacumab have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

About evinacumab and the ELIPSE HoFH Trial
Regeneron invented evinacumab using the company’s VelocImmune® technology, a proprietary genetically-engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically-humanized immune system to produce optimized fully-human monoclonal antibodies. VelocImmune technology has been used to create multiple FDA-approved antibodies including Praluent® (alirocumab), Dupixent® (dupilumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) and Kevzara® (sarilumab). Regeneron previously used these technologies to rapidly develop a treatment for Ebola virus infection, which is currently under review by the FDA, and is now being used in efforts to create prophylactic and treatment medicines for COVID-19.

Evinacumab is an investigational fully-human monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks the function of ANGPTL3 and is currently being studied in patients with HoFH (ongoing Phase 3 extension trial), refractory hypercholesterolemia (Phase 2) and severe hypertriglyceridemia (Phase 2).

ELIPSE (Evinacumab LIPid StudiEs) HoFH was a multi-national Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of evinacumab 15 mg/kg administered intravenously every four weeks in 65 patients aged 12 years or older with HoFH (43 evinacumab, 22 placebo). The primary endpoint was reduction of LDL-C from baseline with evinacumab compared to placebo at 24 weeks.

August 13, 2020 01:07 AM Eastern Daylight Time
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for a new self-administration option for Xolair® (omalizumab) across all approved U.S. indications. If approved, Xolair prefilled syringe would become available for either self-administration by select patients or administration by their caregivers. A decision on approval is anticipated by Q1 2021. In the U.S., Xolair is currently approved for administration by a healthcare provider in a healthcare setting, and is the only approved biologic designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE) for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU).

“We look forward to working closely with the FDA to make Xolair self-administration available as quickly as possible to provide patients with greater flexibility to manage their treatment needs.”

Tweet this

“Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to provide self-administration of Xolair to our patients, particularly those who are considered high-risk for severe illness,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We look forward to working closely with the FDA to make Xolair self-administration available as quickly as possible to provide patients with greater flexibility to manage their treatment needs.”

If approved, once Xolair therapy has been established and closely observed by a healthcare provider, self-administration of Xolair prefilled syringe outside of a healthcare setting by a patient or caregiver may be deemed appropriate by the healthcare provider for select patients. In those instances, the patient or caregiver would be trained by a healthcare provider in the correct subcutaneous injection technique and recognition of the early signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis.

Approximately 460,000 patients have been treated in the U.S. with Xolair since its initial approval for allergic asthma in 2003. The use of Xolair in allergic asthma and CIU is supported by a robust clinical development program, including eight Phase III studies. Independent clinical studies involving patients with allergic asthma and CIU on Xolair treatment suggest that Xolair may be self-administered with proper training and monitoring.

In the U.S., Genentech and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation work together to develop and co-promote Xolair.

About Allergic Asthma and Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria

Asthma is a serious and chronic lung disease affecting an estimated 24 million people in the U.S. It causes swelling and narrowing of the airways, making breathing difficult. Allergic asthma, the most common form of asthma, accounts for approximately 60 percent of asthma cases in adults.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a skin condition that can cause hives and severe itch that can last many months and years. CIU is characterized by hives that spontaneously occur without an identifiable cause, and recur for six weeks or more. It is estimated that approximately 1.5 million people in the U.S. have CIU.

About Xolair

Xolair is the only approved antibody designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE). By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimizes the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade.

Xolair U.S. Indications

Xolair for subcutaneous use is an injectable prescription medicine approved by the FDA to treat:

Moderate to severe persistent asthma in patients six years of age or older whose asthma symptoms are not controlled by asthma medicines called inhaled corticosteroids. A skin or blood test is performed to see if a patient has allergies to year-round allergens.
Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU; chronic hives without a known cause) in patients 12 years of age and older who continue to have hives that are not controlled by H1 antihistamine treatment.
Xolair is not used to treat other allergic conditions, other forms of urticaria, acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

Important Safety Information

The most important information patients should know about XOLAIR is that a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis can happen when you receive XOLAIR. The reaction can occur after the first dose, or after many doses. It may also occur right after a XOLAIR injection or days later. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition and can lead to death. Go to the nearest emergency room right away if you have any of these symptoms of an allergic reaction:

wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, or trouble breathing
low blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, rapid or weak heartbeat, anxiety, or feeling of “impending doom”
flushing, itching, hives, or feeling warm
swelling of the throat or tongue, throat tightness, hoarse voice, or trouble swallowing
The patient’s healthcare provider will monitor you closely for symptoms of an allergic reaction while you are receiving XOLAIR and for a period of time after the patient’s injection. The patient’s healthcare provider should talk to the patient about getting medical treatment if they have symptoms of an allergic reaction after leaving the healthcare provider’s office or treatment center.

Patients must not receive XOLAIR if they are allergic to omalizumab or any of the ingredients.

Before receiving XOLAIR, patients must tell their healthcare provider about all of their medical conditions, including if they:

have a latex allergy or any other allergies (such as food allergy or seasonal allergies). The needle cap on the XOLAIR prefilled syringe may contain latex.
have sudden breathing problems (bronchospasm)
have ever had a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis
have or have had a parasitic infection
have or have had cancer
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if XOLAIR may harm your unborn baby.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if XOLAIR passes into your breast milk. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby while you receive XOLAIR.
Patients must tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements.

Receiving XOLAIR

XOLAIR should be given by your healthcare provider, in a healthcare setting.
XOLAIR is given in 1 or more injections under the skin (subcutaneous), 1 time every 2 or 4 weeks.
In asthma patients, a blood test for a substance called IgE must be performed prior to starting XOLAIR to determine the appropriate dose and dosing frequency.
In patients with chronic hives, a blood test is not necessary to determine the dose or dosing frequency.
Do not decrease or stop taking any of your other asthma or hive medicine unless your healthcare providers tell you to.
You may not see improvement in your symptoms right away after XOLAIR treatment.
Possible Side Effects of XOLAIR

XOLAIR may cause serious side effects, including:

See, “What is the most important information I should know about XOLAIR” in the XOLAIR Medication Guide at http://www.xolair.com regarding the risk of anaphylaxis.
Cancer. Cases of cancer were observed in some people who received XOLAIR.
Inflammation of your blood vessels. Rarely, this can happen in people with asthma who receive XOLAIR.

41516,Alphabet's Verily Establishes CLIA-Certified Lab Focusing on COVID-19 Testing,"Verily stands up CLIA-certified lab focused on COVID-19 testing: an interview with Deb Hanks, MD, Verily’s head of Pathology","Verily has expedite the COVID-19 testing with a new lab-based at South San Francisco. The lab will use the technology from Thermo Fisher Scientific’s‎ TaqPath test kit that has received the US FDA’s EUA to test COVID-19
 Verily has submitted a EUA for an adaptation of the TaqPath test to use in testing pooled patient specimens. Pooling is expected to enable our clinical lab to increase our testing capacity even further while maintaining a high level of overall test performance.
 Additionally, the company has verified the Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab test and plans to implement additional tests in our lab","Surging COVID-19 testing demand is once again outpacing lab capacity, and nationwide, people are waiting a week or sometimes longer to get test results. In response to the continued demand for testing, Verily has established a CLIA-certified lab at our South San Francisco headquarters to create additional lab capacity in support of programs in the COVID-19 testing space, including our own return-to-work efforts for our own employees.

What are the challenges we’re seeing right now with testing?
Diagnostic labs are experiencing unprecedented demand for their services, sometimes resulting in longer turnaround times from sampling to return of results. Highly experienced labs, adept at handling high volumes of testing, have gone from a two-to-three day turnaround time for a molecular-based RT-PCR COVID-19 test to seven days or longer. When test results are delayed, not only do everyday decisions become harder for the person tested – for example, whether it’s safe to return to work – but it becomes challenging for our public health departments to trace local outbreaks, interrupt transmission, and formulate guidance for their communities.

How is the testing backlog impacting therapeutic development efforts?
The time it takes to return test results can be a rate-limiting factor for the development of new treatment interventions. For example, trials for new potential therapies may require only a few days from initial collection of a COVID-19 test sample to a patient joining an interventional trial. Reducing the testing turnaround time can help support research needed to bring new therapies and treatments to market by identifying infected individuals quickly enough for them to join these studies.

How are participants in Verily’s programs today getting COVID-19 testing?
We have established partnerships with several leading test providers for our COVID-19 testing programs and plan to continue scaling with existing lab partners, as well as with the Verily lab, to meet our customers’ and community partners’ needs for testing across the country.

What is the status of Verily’s efforts to establish a CLIA-certified lab on the Verily campus?
When the pandemic hit, it became clear that we needed to rapidly establish a lab and to receive California state licensure and CLIA certification, which we have done. We’ve verified the performance in our lab of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test via ThermoFisher Scientific’s‎ TaqPath test kit. This test kit has received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This test is intended to tell you whether you’re currently infected with COVID-19.

In addition, we have submitted an EUA application for an adaptation of the TaqPath test for use in testing pooled patient specimens. Pooling is expected to enable our clinical lab to increase our testing capacity even further, while maintaining a high level of overall test performance. We have also verified the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, and we plan to implement additional tests in our lab.

The lab infrastructure is now up and running, and we have created a lab information system that will enable us to implement a strict chain of custody procedure for the specimens in our care. Patient privacy is also important to us, and our systems and practices are intended to safeguard the privacy of patient information.

How will Verily use the lab?
We’ve established this lab to provide a focused specialty service with rapid turnaround time. We are launching with the capacity to run several thousand tests per day, primarily focused on our Healthy at Work customers.

 The price for the vaccine is not final but it is expected not to exceed $4/ dose. The vaccine will initially supply to all Latin American countries except Brazil
 The clinical trial conducted in the US, South Africa, England, and Brazil is expected to be completed in Nov or Dec’2020, after which the company would seek approvals. If approved, AstraZeneca will transfer technology to Argentina’s INSUD Group and Mexico’s Laboratorios Liomont at the end of the year and begin manufacturing in Q1’21","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) – Production of 400 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine for Latin America could begin early next year, an executive for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) said on Thursday, as the region’s coronavirus death toll stands at nearly 230,000.

In partnership with the Mexican and Argentinean governments, AstraZeneca plans to initially produce 150 million doses, and eventually make at least 400 million for distribution throughout the region, said Sylvia Varela, head of AstraZeneca Mexico.

Home to some 650 million people, Latin America has registered the world’s highest tallies for coronavirus cases and deaths, with Brazil and Mexico trailing only the United States in record numbers of fatalities.

“We’ll be prioritizing the vulnerable populations,” Varela said at the Mexican president’s daily news conference, noting that the pricing, while still not final, was not expected to exceed $4 per dose. That could bring the cost of the first 150 million doses to $600 million.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador hailed the agreement as “good news” for Mexico, and said the vaccine would be distributed without cost in the country, which ranks third worldwide in number of fatalities.

Lopez Obrador said he expected the country to still be suffering from the pandemic by the time the vaccine goes into production.

Argentina’s president flagged the agreement with Mexico and AstraZeneca, Britain’s second-largest drugmaker, on Wednesday, noting that the initial supply is meant to reach all Latin America except Brazil.

Brazil earlier this month committed $355 million to purchase and produce the AstraZeneca vaccine.

The Mexico-Argentina plan, whose cost is unclear, has significant funding from the foundation of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. A spokesman declined to give a sum.

Varela said Phase III trials taking place in the United States, South Africa, England and Brazil were expected to conclude by November or December, after which the company would seek government approvals.

If granted, the company would then transfer technology to Argentina’s INSUD Group and Mexico’s Laboratorios Liomont at the end of the year, and begin manufacturing in the first quarter of 2021, she said.

The active substance in the vaccine would be made in Argentina and sent to Mexico to be completed for distribution, Varela said.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EfXHw-HU0AA9ywx.jpg,Biotech|COVID-19,AstraZeneca,COVID-19 Vaccine,covid-19 | biotech | 2021|AstraZeneca|Early|Initiate|production|vaccine,publish,14/8/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/astrazeneca-set-to-start-making-400-million-covid-19-vaccines-for-latam-early-in-2021/,https://pharmashots.com/41554/astrazeneca-to-initiate-production-of-its-covid-19-vaccine-early-in-2021/

The agreement includes an option to purchase up to an additional 200M dose
 If approved, the EC expects to facilitate a process for the allocation of the vaccine doses among the member states.
 The exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds for vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies","The European Commission has today concluded exploratory talks with Johnson & Johnson to purchase a potential vaccine against COVID-19. This is following the first positive steps with Sanofi-GSK on 31 July. The envisaged contract with Johnson & Johnson would provide for the possibility for all EU Member States to purchase the vaccine, as well as to donate to lower and middle income countries or re-direct to EEA countries. It is anticipated that, once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission would have a contractual framework in place for the initial purchase of 200 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, and could further purchase up to an additional 200 million vaccine doses. The Commission pursues intensive discussions with other vaccine manufacturers.

Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: “Our citizens’ lives and our economy need a safe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus. Today’s talks bring us closer to achieving this. The Commission is making every effort, in close cooperation with the Member States and with pharmaceutical companies to actively contribute to this end.”

Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “Today we take a further step in ensuring rapid access to an innovative vaccine being developed against the coronavirus. Our negotiations to secure a broad portfolio of vaccines for our citizens and the world will continue unabated. A safe and effective vaccine will decisively contribute to protecting citizens against the virus. We will keep working shoulder to shoulder with our Member States until the vaccine reaches everyone.”

The exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.

Background

Today’s conclusion of the exploratory talks with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, is an important step towards the conclusion of an Advance Purchase Agreement, and therefore towards the implementation of the European Vaccine Strategy, adopted by the Commission on 17 June 2020.  This strategy aims to secure for all European citizens high-quality, safe, effective and affordable vaccines within 12 to 18 months. To do so, and together with the Member States, the Commission is agreeing Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers reserving or giving the Member States the right to buy a given number of vaccine doses for a certain price, as and when a vaccine becomes available.

The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe.

This is why it has raised almost €16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.

Builds on and complements Novavax-CEPI collaboration to develop and distribute NVX-CoV2373
Novavax, SK bioscience and Republic of Korea intend to partner for manufacture and supply of vaccine for global markets including South Korea
GAITHERSBURG, Md. and SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), a late stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, and SK bioscience, a vaccine business subsidiary of SK Group, today announced a development and supply agreement for the antigen component of NVX-CoV2373, Novavax’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate, for supply to global markets including the COVAX Facility. In addition, the companies have signed a letter of intent with the Republic of Korea’s Ministry of Health and Welfare to work toward broad and equitable access to NVX-CoV2373 for the global market as well as to make the vaccine available in South Korea.

Under the terms of the agreement, SK bioscience will manufacture the vaccine antigen component for use in the final drug product globally during the pandemic period.

NVX-CoV2373 was developed using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate a stable, prefusion antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein. It contains Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Phase 1 data from the Company’s Phase 1/2 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial shows that NVX-CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited robust antibody responses numerically superior to that seen in human convalescent sera.

SK bioscience, using its cell culture and recombinant protein capability, will initiate the production of the NVX-CoV2373 antigen at its vaccine facility in Andong L-house, South Korea beginning in August 2020.

This contract development and manufacturing organization agreement leverages the capacity reservation agreement between SK bioscience and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Novavax’ NVX-CoV2373 will be manufactured using a part of the reserved capacity at SK Bioscience’s “L-House” facility.

This agreement further boosts the potential global supply of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine and is an important component of Novavax’ collaboration with CEPI. Through that partnership with CEPI, Novavax has committed to develop and manufacture significant amounts of NVX-CoV2373, including vaccine derived from antigen coming from SK bioscience, if proved safe and effective, to be procured and distributed by the COVAX Facility through a globally fair allocation framework.

About NVX-CoV2373

NVX‑CoV2373 is a vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of SARS‑CoV‑2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. NVX‑CoV2373 was created using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and contains Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. In preclinical trials, NVX‑CoV2373 demonstrated indication of antibodies that block binding of spike protein to receptors targeted by the virus, a critical aspect for effective vaccine protection. In its Phase 1 data of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, NVX‑CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited robust antibody responses numerically superior to that seen in human convalescent sera. Novavax has secured $2 billion in funding for its global coronavirus vaccine program, including up to $388 million in funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

 The focus of the acquisition is to strengthen its R&D areas of autoimmune and allergic diseases with the expansion of the SAR442168 development program into CNS disorders. Additionally, the deal also adds rilzabrutinib to Sanofi’s portfolio of immunology and inflammation indications
 The Principia’s BTK inhibitor ‘168 is developed using its Tailored Covalency platform and was evaluated in P-IIb study for MS leading reduction of 85% Gd-enhancing T1 hyperintense lesions vs PBO. In 2017, Sanofi signed exclusive WW license agreement with Principia to develop and commercialize BTK inhibitor ‘168 in MS and other CNS diseases","Sanofi to acquire Principia Biopharma

Further strengthens core R&D areas of autoimmune and allergic diseases
Provides full control of brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor SAR442168 in multiple sclerosis (MS), making commercialization more efficient and eliminating future royalty payments
Allows expansion of SAR442168 development program into other central nervous system diseases and therapeutic areas
Adds clinically advanced oral BTK inhibitor rilzabrutinib with potential across a range of immunology and inflammation indications, complementing Sanofi’s existing R&D pipeline
PARIS and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – August 17, 2020 – Sanofi and Principia Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ: PRNB), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for immune-mediated diseases, entered into a definitive agreement under which Sanofi will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Principia for $100  per share in cash, which represents an aggregate equity value of approximately $3.68 billion (on a fully diluted basis). The Sanofi and Principia Boards of Directors unanimously approved the transaction.

“This acquisition advances our ongoing R&D transformation to accelerate development of the most promising medicines that will address significant patient needs,” said Paul Hudson, Sanofi Chief Executive Officer. “The addition of multiple BTK inhibitors to our pipeline demonstrates our commitment to strategic product acquisitions in our priority therapeutic areas. Full ownership of our brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor ‘168 removes complexities for this priority development program and simplifies future commercialization.”

“The Phase 2b data in relapsing multiple sclerosis showed the strong potential of ‘168 to address disability and disease progression, and triggered the start of Phase 3 studies across the full spectrum of MS. Through this acquisition, we will be able to expand and accelerate development of BTK inhibitors across multiple indications. Both ‘168 and rilzabrutinib, have ‘pipeline in a product’ potential, and we look forward to unlocking their full treatment benefits across an array of diseases,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research & Development at Sanofi.

“Principia’s successful design and development of a whole portfolio of BTK inhibitors for immunology is aimed to transform the treatment for patients with immune-mediated diseases. By combining with Sanofi, we will bring significant resources to expand and accelerate the potential benefits of these therapies. The benefit of developing several BTK inhibitors will allow us to target specific organ systems for optimal patient benefit. The merger will provide global resources to get these novel therapies to patients faster,” said Martin Babler, President and CEO at Principia Biopharma.

Principia’s Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors add to Sanofi’s efforts to accelerate and build a portfolio of the next generation of transformative treatments for autoimmune diseases. BTK is present in the signaling pathways of key innate and adaptive cell types of the immune system. Being able to block or disrupt these signaling processes can help in stopping inflammation and tissue destruction related to autoimmune diseases and target some of the underlying pathophysiology.

BTK inhibitor ‘168: In a Phase 2b study in patients with multiple sclerosis, ‘168 reduced Gd-enhancing T1 hyperintense lesions by 85% compared to placebo. In June, Sanofi announced the first multiple sclerosis patient was enrolled in the Phase 3 program for the BTK inhibitor, comprising four pivotal clinical trials across the disease spectrum. The Principia acquisition will provide an opportunity to expand the development program to evaluate indications beyond central nervous system diseases.
Rilzabrutinib: This oral BTK inhibitor is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 program for patients with moderate to severe pemphigus, a rare, debilitating autoimmune disease that causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. A Phase 3 program for immune thrombocytopenia, a disease that causes high risk for bleeding events, is expected to be initiated by the end of 2020, assuming no COVID-19 related impact. The company also has an ongoing Phase 2 program for IgG4-related diseases, which is driven by chronic inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and fibrosis within organs that can lead to severe morbidity.
PRN473 Topical: This BTK inhibitor is a topical agent currently in Phase 1 trials and is being developed for immune-mediated diseases that could benefit from localized application to the skin.
The Principia BTK inhibitor franchise is based on its proprietary Tailored Covalency® platform that has generated potential best-in-class clinical candidates. The platform allows the design of both reversible covalent and irreversible covalent small molecule inhibitors that are more selective with less off-target effects. The optimized target residence time has potential to deliver a desired efficacy with a stronger safety profile.

In 2017, Sanofi formed a collaboration with Principia under which Principia granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize BTK inhibitor ‘168 in multiple sclerosis and other central nervous system diseases.

Transaction Terms 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Principia common stock for $100 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $3.36 billion.

The consummation of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Principia common stock, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and other customary conditions.

First and only FDA-approved subcutaneous treatment option for anti-aquaporin-4 antibody positive NMOSD that can be self-administered by a person with NMOSD or a caregiver every four weeks
First and only approved therapy for NMOSD designed to target and inhibit interleukin-6 receptor activity, using novel recycling antibody technology
Approval supported by one of the largest clinical trial programmes undertaken for this rare disease
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ENSPRYNG™ (satralizumab-mwge) as the first and only subcutaneous treatment for adults living with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). NMOSD is a rare, lifelong and debilitating autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, that primarily damages the optic nerve(s) and spinal cord, causing blindness, muscle weakness and paralysis.

“Today’s FDA approval of ENSPRYNG, the first subcutaneous NMOSD treatment using novel recycling antibody technology, builds upon the work we’ve done in multiple sclerosis with OCREVUS to develop first-in-class medicines and further the scientific understanding of neuroimmunological diseases,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We thank the NMOSD community, including patients and investigators who participated in ENSPRYNG clinical trials.”

ENSPRYNG is a humanised monoclonal antibody and the only approved therapy designed to target and inhibit interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor activity, believed to play a key role in the inflammation associated with NMOSD. The treatment was designed by Chugai, a member of the Roche group, using novel recycling antibody technology, which compared to conventional technology, allows for longer duration of antibody circulation and subcutaneous dosing every four weeks.

“For people with NMOSD, relapses can cause devastating, irreversible and disabling neurological effects,” said Professor Jeffrey Bennett, University of Colorado Neurology & Ophthalmology, and investigator for the ENSPRYNG pivotal clinical trials. “Having an approved therapy that can be administered subcutaneously in the home, and has demonstrated an impact on the frequency of relapses, is an important advancement for patients.”

“We are very optimistic the addition of this new approved treatment option will make a meaningful difference for those living with NMOSD, those who love and support them and the doctors who treat them,” said Victoria Jackson, founder, The Guthy-Jackson Charitable Foundation. “When my daughter was diagnosed with NMOSD in 2008, there were no approved treatment options, and a critical lack of resources and understanding for people living with this disabling disorder. After years of dedicated effort and collaboration, the FDA approval of ENSPRYNG exemplifies how patients, industry, and academia can find solutions together.”

ENSPRYNG can be administered in the home by a person living with NMOSD or a caregiver following training from a healthcare provider. ENSPRYNG treatment is administered every four weeks after an initial loading dose.

ENSPRYNG will be available in the United States in two weeks.

FDA approval is based on results from one of the largest pivotal clinical trial programmes undertaken for this rare neurological disorder

This approval is supported by results from two randomised controlled Phase III clinical trials, the SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky studies, in which ENSPRYNG demonstrated robust and sustained efficacy and a favourable safety profile in adults with AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD. Results were sustained for 96 weeks, significantly reducing the risk of relapse compared with placebo as a monotherapy and when used concurrently with baseline immunosuppressant therapy (IST), which has commonly been used to manage NMOSD symptoms associated with relapses.

In the SAkuraStar monotherapy study’s AQP4 antibody positive subgroup, 76.5% of ENSPRYNG-treated patients were relapse-free at 96 weeks, compared to 41.1% with placebo. In the SAkuraSky study, which evaluated ENSPRYNG when used concurrently with baseline IST, 91.1% of ENSPRYNG-treated AQP4 antibody positive subgroup patients were relapse-free at 96 weeks, compared to 56.8% with placebo. The primary endpoint of both SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky was time to first protocol-defined relapse (PDR) adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period.

The most common adverse reactions with ENSPRYNG (incidence ≥ 15%) were nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, gastritis, rash, arthralgia, extremity pain, fatigue and nausea.

About SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky in NMOSD
SAkuraStar is a Phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENSPRYNG monotherapy administered to patients with NMOSD. The primary endpoint is the time to first protocol-defined relapse (PDR), adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period. Results from the SAkuraStar study were presented at the 35th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), September 11-13, 2019, and were published in The Lancet Neurology in April 2020.

Ninety-five adult patients were randomised to either of the following two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio: ENSPRYNG (120 mg) or placebo. Both treatments were administered subcutaneously at week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4-week intervals. The double-blind treatment period ended at 1.5 years after the enrolment of the last patient. After experiencing a PDR or upon completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with ENSPRYNG in an open label extension (OLE) period. Patients with aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive or negative neuromyelitis optica (NMO, as defined by the diagnostic criteria in 2006) and those with AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD were enrolled. The number of AQP4 antibody negative patients was limited to approximately 33% of the total population of the study. Data have shown that AQP4 antibody positive patients may experience a greater likelihood of relapse and poorer long-term outcomes than AQP4 antibody negative patients.

SAkuraSky is a Phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENSPRYNG added to baseline immunosuppressant therapy in patients with NMOSD. The primary endpoint was the time to first relapse as adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period. Results from the SAkuraSky study were published in the November 28, 2019 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

Seventy-six adult patients were randomised to either of the following two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio: ENSPRYNG (120 mg) or placebo added to baseline therapy (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and/or corticosteroids). Both treatments were administered subcutaneously at week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4-week intervals. The double-blind treatment ended when patients experienced a PDR; the study ended when the total number of PDRs reached 26. After experiencing a PDR or upon completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with ENSPRYNG in an OLE period. Patients with AQP4 antibody positive or negative neuromyelitis optica (NMO, as defined by diagnostic criteria in 2006) and those with AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD were enrolled. AQP4 antibody negative patients represented approximately 30% of the SAkuraSky study population.

About neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)
NMOSD is a rare, lifelong and debilitating autoimmune condition of the central nervous system that primarily damages the optic nerve(s) and spinal cord, causing blindness, muscle weakness and paralysis. People with NMOSD experience unpredictable, severe relapses directly causing cumulative, permanent, neurological damage and disability. In some cases, relapse can result in death. NMOSD affects over 10,000 people in Europe, up to 15,000 people in the US and approximately 200,000 people worldwide. NMOSD can affect individuals of any age, race and gender, but is most common among women in their 30s and 40s, and appears to occur at higher rates in people of African or Asian background. There is some evidence that people of African or Asian descent may also experience a more severe disease course.

NMOSD is commonly associated with pathogenic antibodies (AQP4) that target and damage a specific cell type, called astrocytes, resulting in inflammatory lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain. AQP4 antibodies are detectable in the blood serum of around 70-80% of NMOSD patients.

Although most cases of NMOSD can be confirmed through a diagnostic test, people living with the condition are still frequently misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This is due to overlapping characteristics of the two disorders, including a higher prevalence in women, similar symptoms and the fact that both are relapse-based conditions.

About ENSPRYNG™ (satralizumab-mwge)
ENSPRYNG, which was designed by Chugai, a member of the Roche group, is a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets IL-6 receptor activity. The cytokine IL-6 is believed to be a key driver in NMOSD, triggering the inflammation cascade and leading to damage and disability. ENSPRYNG was designed using novel antibody recycling technology, which compared to conventional technology, allows for longer duration of the antibody and subcutaneous dosing every four weeks.

Positive Phase III results for ENSPRYNG, as both monotherapy and used concurrently with baseline immunosuppressant therapy, suggest that IL-6 inhibition is an effective therapeutic approach for NMOSD. The Phase III clinical development programme for ENSPRYNG includes two studies: SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky.

ENSPRYNG is also approved in Canada, Japan and Switzerland. Applications are under review with numerous regulators, including in the EU and China.

ENSPRYNG has been designated as an orphan drug in the US, Europe and Japan. In addition, it was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of NMOSD by the FDA in December 2018.

ABO-202 is a one-time, self-complementary AAV (serotype 9) gene therapy designed to deliver a functional copy of the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) gene. Preclinical studies in a CLN1 animal model demonstrated that ABO-202 normalized survival and led to improvement of neurological function in affected mice.  The therapy has been granted Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has received Orphan Medicinal Product Designation from the European Medicines Agency.

About CLN1 disease (Infantile Batten disease)
CLN1 disease, also known as Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis or infantile Batten disease, is a rapidly progressing rare lysosomal storage disease with no approved treatment. It primarily affects the central nervous system and typically manifests during the first year of life with vision impairment that can progress to blindness, progressive motor and cognitive decline, seizures and ultimately early death. The underlying cause of the disorder is a defect in the PPT1 gene that encodes the enzyme of the same name, resulting in the accumulation of lipopigments within cells, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Some patients with CLN1 disease develop symptoms later in childhood or in adulthood; these variants are called late-infantile, juvenile, or adult-onset CLN1.

About ABO-202
ABO-202 is a novel, one-time gene therapy for CLN1 disease, a rapidly progressing rare lysosomal storage disease with no approved therapy. ABO-202 delivers a functional copy of the PPT1 gene to address the underlying gene and enzyme deficiency that leads to abnormal buildup of lipopigments and results in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

 Roche will grant $15M as milestones to PTC following MAA acceptance. Evrysdi is an SMN2-directed RNA splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q leading to SMN protein deficiency","SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J., Aug. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTCT) today announced the acceptance of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The EMA previously granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation to risdiplam for the treatment of people with SMA, providing a pathway for accelerated evaluation by the agency. The milestone triggers a $15 million payment to PTC from Roche.

“The acceptance of the MAA for Evrysdi™ marks an important milestone as we continue towards the goal of making this ground-breaking therapy available globally to a broad range of SMA patients,” said Stuart W. Peltz, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of PTC Therapeutics. “Evrysdi™ has consistently demonstrated clinically meaningful results in multiple clinical trials with a favorable safety profile. Evrysdi™ is an oral medicine that can be delivered and taken at-home, which is particularly important for SMA patients during the COVID-19 global pandemic.”

The submission, which was filed by Roche, is based on data from the dose-finding Part 1 and confirmatory Part 2 of the FIREFISH and SUNFISH studies which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) in symptomatic infants with type 1 SMA aged 2 to 7 months and in people with types 2 or 3 SMA aged 2 to 25 years, respectively. In addition, the submission incorporates safety data from JEWELFISH, a trial in people with all types of SMA aged 1 to 60 years previously treated with other SMA therapies. The results of an exploratory efficacy analysis from SUNFISH Part 1 showed Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) significantly improved motor function after 24 months of treatment compared to natural history data. Part 2 of the FIREFISH study met its primary endpoint of infants sitting without support for five seconds by month 12, as assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (BSID-III). Part 2 of the SUNFISH trial in non-ambulatory children and adults demonstrated that change from baseline in total Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) score was significantly greater at 12 months in people treated with Evrysdi™ (risdiplam), compared to placebo.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) for the treatment of SMA for adults and children 2 months and older. Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) is based on PTC science and is commercialized in the United States by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Evrysdi™ is a product of the SMA collaboration between PTC, the SMA Foundation, and Roche.

About Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe, inherited, progressive neuromuscular disease that causes devastating muscle atrophy and disease-related complications. It is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and one of the most common rare diseases, affecting approximately one in 11,000 babies. SMA leads to the progressive loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

SMA is caused by loss of function mutations or deletions of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that results in a deficiency of SMN protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and increasing evidence suggests SMA is a multi-system disorder and the loss of SMN protein may affect many tissues and cells.

About Evrysdi™ (risdiplam)

Evrysdi™ is a survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2)-directed RNA splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Evrysdi™ is designed to distribute evenly to all parts of the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). Evrysdi™ is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or feeding tube. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy for adults and children 2 months and older. Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) is marketed in the United States by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group.

About the Risdiplam Clinical Studies

FIREFISH (NCT02913482): an open-label, two-part pivotal study, was designed to assess Evrysdi™ safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in patients aged 1 to 7 months with type 1 SMA. Part 1 evaluated several doses of Evrysdi™ and determined the therapeutic dose for Part 2.

SUNFISH (NCT02908685): a two-part, placebo-controlled, multicenter pivotal trial, was designed to assess Evrysdi™ safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and PD in people with type 2 or 3 SMA aged 2 to 25, including those with scoliosis and joint contractures at baseline.

Clinical Trial Safety Data

The safety profile of Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) was established across FIREFISH and SUNFISH pivotal trials. The most common adverse reactions in later-onset SMA (incidence of at least 10% of patients treated with Evrysdi™ and more frequently than control) were fever, diarrhea, and rash. The most common adverse reactions in infantile-onset SMA were similar to those observed in later-onset SMA patients. Additionally, the most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 10%) were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation, and vomiting.

45957,AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (durvalumab) Receives the US FDA's Priority Review for Less Frequent Fixed-Dose Use in NSCLC and Bladder Cancer,"Imfinzi granted FDA Priority Review for less-frequent, fixed-dose use","The US FDA has accepted sBLA and granted PR to Imfinzi (1500mg) for a new 4wks. FD regimen to treat patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC after CT and prior treated advanced bladder cancer, consistent with the approved dosing in ES-SCLC
 The company anticipates the PDUFA date in Q4’20. The sBLA is based on multiple clinical trials, including results of P-III CASPIAN trial in ES-SCLC which used the 4wks., FD regimen during maintenance
 If approved, the new dosing will be available as an alternative to the approved weight-based dosing of 10mg/kg q2w","Option would extend dosing to four weeks in non-small cell lung and bladder cancer reducing medical visits by half
AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) has received acceptance for its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and has also been granted Priority Review in the US for a new four-week, fixed-dose regimen for treatment in the approved indications of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bladder cancer.

If approved, Imfinzi could be administered intravenously every four weeks at a fixed dose of 1500mg in unresectable Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy and previously treated advanced bladder cancer, consistent with the approved dosing in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that offer significant advances over available options by demonstrating safety or efficacy improvements, preventing serious conditions, or enhancing patient compliance. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for their regulatory decision, is during the fourth quarter of 2020.

If approved, the new dosing will be available as an alternative to the approved weight-based dosing of 10mg/kg every two weeks. The sBLA was based on data from several Imfinzi clinical trials, including results from the Phase III CASPIAN trial in ES-SCLC which used the four-week, fixed-dose regimen during maintenance.

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “The new less-frequent dosing option for non-small cell lung cancer and bladder cancer will simplify and improve treatment by enabling continuity of care while minimising the risk of exposure to infection in the healthcare setting. This takes on particular urgency during the current pandemic, as doctors care for patients at high risk of COVID-19 complications. We are working with health authorities in the US and other countries to bring the option of four-week, fixed dosing for Imfinzi to patients around the world as soon as we can.”

Imfinzi is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. Imfinzi is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and several other countries. Additionally, it is approved in the US and under review in Japan and other countries for ES-SCLC. Imfinzi was also recently recommended for marketing authorisation in the EU for this indication.

Stage III NSCLC

Stage III (locally-advanced) NSCLC is commonly divided into three sub-categories (IIIA, IIIB and IIIC), defined by how much the cancer has spread locally and the possibility of surgery.1 Stage III disease is different from Stage IV disease, when the cancer has spread (metastasised), as the majority of Stage III patients are currently treated with curative intent.1,2

Stage III NSCLC represents approximately one-third of NSCLC incidence and in 2015 was estimated to affect nearly 200,000 patients in the following eight key countries: China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, and the US, with approximately 43,000 cases in the US alone.3,4 The majority of Stage III NSCLC patients are diagnosed with unresectable tumours.5 Prior to approval of Imfinzi in this setting, no new treatments beyond chemoradiation therapy had been available to patients for decades.6-9

Bladder cancer

In 2018, approximately 550,000 people were diagnosed with bladder cancer around the world and 200,000 died from the disease.10 Locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer remains an area of unmet medical need and typically only one in seven patients are alive five years after diagnosis.11 Urothelial cancer (UC) is the most common form of bladder cancer.12 UC is the 10th most common cancer worldwide and the 13th most common cause of cancer death.10,13 PD-L1 is widely expressed in tumour and immune cells in patients with bladder cancer and helps tumours evade detection from the immune system.14

Imfinzi

Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.

AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. AstraZeneca aims to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFR-mutated tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with the approved medicines Iressa (gefitinib) and Tagrisso (osimertinib) and its ongoing Phase III trials LAURA, NeoADAURA and FLAURA2.15-17

AstraZeneca is committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing Phase II trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD which test Tagrisso in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines. Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate, is in development for metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC including trials in combination with other anticancer treatments. In addition, DS-1062, a trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed ADC, is in early development for advanced NSCLC where TROP2 is overexpressed in the majority of tumours.18

An extensive Immuno-Oncology development programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.19 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially-curative settings (Phase III trials MERMAID-1, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. Imfinzi is also in development in the Phase II trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline including Enhertu.

AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology

Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes Imfinzi as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

AstraZeneca in oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

– Priority Review for trilaciclib is based on positive data from three randomized clinical trials showing robust myelopreservation benefits
– G1 launching expanded access program (EAP) for patients with small cell lung cancer in the U.S.

RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Aug. 17, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — G1 Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GTHX), a clinical-stage oncology company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for trilaciclib for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients being treated with chemotherapy and granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of February 15, 2021. Trilaciclib is a first-in-class investigational therapy designed to preserve bone marrow and immune system function during chemotherapy and improve patient outcomes.

“There are currently no available therapies to protect patients from chemotherapy-induced toxicities before they occur,” said Raj Malik, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President, R&D. “If approved, trilaciclib would be the first proactively administered myelopreservation therapy that is intended to make chemotherapy safer and reduce the need for rescue interventions, such as growth factor administrations and blood transfusions.”

The FDA grants Priority Review to applications for potential therapies that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. The trilaciclib NDA was supported by compelling myelopreservation data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which trilaciclib was administered prior to chemotherapy treatment in patients with SCLC. Trilaciclib has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA. In the NDA acceptance letter, the FDA also stated that it is currently not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application.

“While undergoing chemotherapy, many patients experience significant myelosuppression, become fatigued and susceptible to infection, and often require transfusions and growth factor administrations,” said Jared Weiss, M.D., Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, NC. “Preventing bone marrow damage proactively is an opportunity to improve the quality of life of patients receiving chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer and reduce costly rescue interventions.”

Myelosuppression is the result of damage to bone marrow stem cells and is one of the most common side effects of chemotherapy. Myelosuppression can lead to serious conditions such as anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, which have broad ranging clinical, patient experience and economic impacts on ongoing cancer treatment and overall outcomes. In clinical trials, trilaciclib significantly reduced chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, and patients receiving trilaciclib experienced fewer dose delays/reductions, infections, hospitalizations, and need for rescue therapies compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

Expanded Access Program
G1 is making trilaciclib available to SCLC patients in the U.S., who are unable to enter clinical trials and for whom there are no appropriate alternative treatments while the trilaciclib NDA is under regulatory review, pursuant to FDA’s expanded access program (EAP). To facilitate needed access through the EAP, G1 is collaborating with Bionical Emas, a global specialist clinical research organization (CRO). For more information about the EAP access to trilaciclib, email patient.access.us@Bionical-emas.com.

“Complications from myelosuppression have been a long-standing challenge when treating patients with SCLC,” said Dr. Malik. “Establishing an expanded access program provides qualified patients in serious need with access to trilaciclib while the NDA is under review.”

Trilaciclib in Small Cell Lung Cancer
Trilaciclib is a first-in-class investigational therapy designed to improve outcomes for people with cancer treated with chemotherapy. In 2019, trilaciclib received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and, in June 2020, G1 submitted the NDA based on myelopreservation data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which trilaciclib was administered prior to chemotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In August 2020, G1 received FDA Priority Review with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of February 15, 2021.

In June 2020, G1 announced a co-promotion agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim for trilaciclib in small cell lung cancer in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. If approved, G1 will lead marketing, market access and medical engagement initiatives for trilaciclib. The Boehringer Ingelheim oncology commercial team, well-established in lung cancer, will lead sales force engagement initiatives. G1 will book revenue and retain development and commercialization rights to trilaciclib and pay Boehringer Ingelheim a promotional fee based on net sales. The three-year agreement does not extend to additional indications that G1 is evaluating for trilaciclib. Press release details of the G1/ Boehringer Ingelheim agreement can be found here.

Evaluating Trilaciclib in Other Cancers
In a randomized trial of women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, preliminary data showed that trilaciclib improved overall survival when administered in combination with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The company plans to present final overall survival data from this trial in the fourth quarter of 2020. Trilaciclib is being evaluated in neoadjuvant breast cancer as part of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL™, and the company expects to initiate a Phase 3 trial in patients treated with chemotherapy for colorectal cancer in the fourth quarter of 2020.

About G1 Therapeutics
G1 Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and delivery of next generation therapies that improve the lives of those affected by cancer. The company is developing and advancing two novel therapies: trilaciclib is a first-in-class therapy designed to improve outcomes for patients being treated with chemotherapy; rintodestrant is a potential best-in-class oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.

 In 2019, Lilly and Innovent began commercializing Tyvyt in China after receiving approval for r/r classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma post-2L systemic CT and was included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies","INDIANAPOLIS and SUZHOU, China, Aug. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Innovent Biologics, Inc. (HKEX: 01801) today announced a global expansion of their strategic alliance for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody immuno-oncology medicine that was co-developed by Innovent and Lilly in China.

Innovent logo (PRNewsFoto/Eli Lilly and Company)
In 2019, Lilly and Innovent began commercializing TYVYT in China after being granted marketing approval for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic chemotherapy. TYVYT is the only PD-1 inhibitor to be included in China’s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) and is included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies.

Lilly and Innovent currently co-commercialize TYVYT in China. Under the terms of the expanded license agreement, Lilly will obtain an exclusive license for TYVYT for geographies outside of China and plans to pursue registration of TYVYT in the U.S. and other markets. In return, Innovent will receive an upfront payment of $200 million and will be eligible for up to $825 million in potential development and commercial milestones, as well as tiered double-digit royalties on net sales. Both companies will also retain the right to study TYVYT in combination with other medicines as part of their own clinical programs.

The two companies are also studying TYVYT as a potential therapy in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and several other types of cancer. Earlier this month, the two companies released encouraging interim analysis data from ORIENT-11 at the IASLC World Conference on Lung Cancer 2020 Virtual Presidential Symposium. ORIENT-11 is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating TYVYT or placebo in combination with Alimta® (pemetrexed for injection) and platinum chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements. Based on the interim analysis conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, TYVYT in combination with Alimta and platinum chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with placebo in combination with Alimta and platinum chemotherapy, which met the pre-defined efficacy criteria. A supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for this indication is under regulatory review in China. The companies look forward to future submissions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies for this and other indications.

About TYVYT (Sintilimab Injection)
TYVYT (sintilimab injection) is an innovative drug with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Lilly in China. TYVYT has been granted marketing approval by the NMPA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic chemotherapy and was included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies.

In April 2020, the NMPA accepted the supplemental new drug application for TYVYT in combination with ALIMTA (pemetrexed for injection) and platinum as first-line therapy in advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In May 2020, TYVYT combined with  gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy met the predefined primary endpoint in the Phase 3 ORIENT-12 study as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. TYVYT monotherapy met the primary endpoint in the ORIENT-2 study as second-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as well. In August 2020, the NMPA accepted the sNDA for TYVYT in combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC.

TYVYT is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1/ PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies with TYVYT to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials.

TYVYT (sintilimab injection) is not an approved product in the United States. ALIMTA(pemetrexed for injection) is not approved for use in combination with TYVYT in the United States.

U.S. INDICATIONS FOR ALIMTA® (pemetrexed for injection)
ALIMTA is indicated:

in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy for the initial treatment of patients with nonsquamous metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.
in combination with cisplatin for the initial treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
as a single agent for the maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.

in combination with cisplatin, for the initial treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) whose disease is unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery.
U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ALIMTA® (pemetrexed for injection)
CONTRAINDICATION

ALIMTA is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pemetrexed.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Myelosuppression and Increased Risk of Myelosuppression Without Vitamin Supplementation

ALIMTA can cause severe myelosuppression resulting in a requirement for transfusions and which may lead to neutropenic infection. The risk of myelosuppression is increased in patients who do not receive vitamin supplementation.
Prior to treatment with ALIMTA, patients must be instructed to initiate supplementation with oral folic acid. Intramuscular injections of vitamin B12 are also required prior to ALIMTA treatment. Folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation should be continued during treatment and for 21 days after the last dose of ALIMTA as they may reduce the severity of treatment-related hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities. Obtain a complete blood count at the beginning of each cycle. Do not administer ALIMTA until the ANC is at least 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm3. Permanently reduce ALIMTA in patients with an ANC of less than 500 cells/mm3 or platelet count of less than 50,000 cells/mm3 in previous cycles.
In Studies JMDB and JMCH, among patients who received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia was 15% and 23%, the incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia was 6% and 4%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was 4% and 5%, respectively. In Study JMCH, 18% of patients in the ALIMTA arm required red blood cell transfusions compared to 7% of patients in the cisplatin arm. In Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI, where all patients received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia ranged from 3% to 5%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia ranged from 3% to 5%.
Renal Failure

ALIMTA can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, renal toxicity. Determine creatinine clearance before each dose and periodically monitor renal function during treatment with ALIMTA.
The incidences of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA with cisplatin were 2.1% in Study JMDB and 2.2% in Study JMCH. The incidence of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA as a single agent ranged from 0.4% to 0.6% (Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI).
Withhold ALIMTA in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 mL/min.
Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Toxicity

Serious and sometimes fatal, bullous, blistering, and exfoliative skin toxicity, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, can occur with ALIMTA. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for severe and life-threatening bullous, blistering, or exfoliating skin toxicity.
Interstitial Pneumonitis

Serious interstitial pneumonitis, including fatal cases, can occur with ALIMTA treatment. Withhold ALIMTA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, or fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If pneumonitis is confirmed, permanently discontinue ALIMTA.
Radiation Recall

Radiation recall can occur with ALIMTA in patients who have received radiation weeks to years previously. Monitor patients for inflammation or blistering in areas of previous radiation treatment. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for signs of radiation recall.
Increased Risk of Toxicity With Ibuprofen in Patients With Renal Impairment

Exposure to ALIMTA is increased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment who take concomitant ibuprofen, increasing the risks of adverse reactions of ALIMTA. In patients with creatinine clearances between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min, avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA. If concomitant ibuprofen use cannot be avoided, monitor patients more frequently for ALIMTA adverse reactions, including myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALIMTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in developmental delays and increased malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose of 500 mg/m2. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 3 months after the final dose.
DRUG INTERACTIONS

Ibuprofen increases exposure (AUC) of pemetrexed. In patients with creatinine clearance between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min:
Avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA.
Monitor patients more frequently for myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity, if concomitant administration of ibuprofen cannot be avoided.
ADVERSE REACTIONS

Severe adverse reactions (Grade 3-4) occurring in ≥20% of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) versus ALIMTA with platinum chemotherapy + placebo for initial treatment (KEYNOTE-189), respectively, were fatigue (12% vs 6%); diarrhea (5% vs 3%); dyspnea (3.7% vs 5%); vomiting (3.7% vs 3%); nausea (3.5% vs 3.5%); rash (2% vs 2.5%); decreased appetite (1.5% vs 0.5%); constipation (1% vs 0.5%); and pyrexia (0.2% vs 0%).
Common adverse reactions (all grades) occurring in ≥20% of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) versus ALIMTA with platinum chemotherapy + placebo for initial treatment (KEYNOTE-189), respectively, were nausea (56% vs 52%); fatigue (56% vs 58%); constipation (35% vs 32%); diarrhea (31% vs 21%); decreased appetite (28% vs 30%); rash (25% vs 17%); vomiting (24% vs 23%); cough (21% vs 28%); dyspnea (21% vs 26%); and pyrexia (20% vs 15%).
USE IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS

Lactation: There is no information regarding the presence of pemetrexed or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from ALIMTA, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ALIMTA and for one week after the last dose.
Males of Reproductive Potential: ALIMTA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible.
Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ALIMTA in pediatric patients have not been established. Adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients studied were similar to those observed in adults.
Patients with Renal Impairment: ALIMTA is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Decreased renal function results in reduced clearance and greater exposure (AUC) to ALIMTA compared with patients with normal renal function. No dose is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min.
Geriatric: The incidences of Grade 3-4 anemia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and neutropenia were higher in patients 65 years of age and older as compared to younger patients: in at least one of five randomized clinical trials.

46073,Regeneron Collaborates with Roche to Improve the Global Supply of REGN-COV2 Against COVID-19,Roche and Regeneron collaborate to significantly increase global supply of REGN-COV2 investigational antibody combination for COVID-19,"The two global companies collaborated to develop, manufacture, and distribute REGN-COV2 across the globe. The agreement is expected to increase the supply of REGN-COV2 to at least 3.5 times the current capacity with the potential for expanding it further
 Regeneron will lead the distribution in the US while Roche will be responsible for the distribution outside the US, both will bear distribution expenses in their designated territories. Each partner will dedicate a manufacturing capacity to REGN-COV2 every year while the collaborators have started the technology transfer process
 The partners will jointly fund and execute the ongoing P-III prevention and P-I healthy volunteers safety studies as well as additional global studies to assess the potential for REGN-COV2 against COVID-19. Additionally, Roche will solely responsible for the initial EMA’s approval or conducting any additional studies required for approval outside the US","REGN-COV2 is Regeneron’s two-antibody combination currently in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 infection.
The companies will collaborate on developing and manufacturing REGN-COV2. Regeneron will distribute REGN-COV2 in the U.S. and Roche will be responsible for distribution outside the U.S.
Under this collaboration, the overall capacity of REGN-COV2 is expected to increase by at least three and a half times, substantially increasing the number of doses available to patients in the U.S. and around the world. 
Basel, 19 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) and Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) announced today that they are joining forces in the fight against COVID-19 to develop, manufacture and distribute REGN-COV2, Regeneron’s investigational antiviral antibody combination, to people around the globe. REGN-COV2 could provide a much-needed treatment option for people already experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, and also has the potential to prevent infection in people exposed to the virus, thus slowing the spread of the global pandemic. This collaboration is expected to increase supply of REGN-COV2 to at least three and a half times the current capacity, with the potential for even further expansion.

REGN-COV2 is currently being studied in two Phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 and in a Phase 3 trial for the prevention of COVID-19 in household contacts of infected individuals. If it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted, Regeneron will distribute and record sales for REGN-COV2 in the U.S. and Roche will be responsible for distribution outside the U.S.

“We are excited about the potential for one medicine to serve both as a treatment for those infected as well as protection for people exposed to the virus. REGN-COV2 could be a critical line of defense against the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Bill Anderson, Chief Executive Officer of Roche Pharmaceuticals. “We’re committing our manufacturing expertise and capacity, and our global distribution network to bring Regeneron’s potential antibody combination to as many people around the world as we possibly can.”

“Regeneron has progressed the REGN-COV2 research and development program at record speed and worked tirelessly to maximize our in-house manufacturing capacity,” said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Regeneron. “This major collaboration with Roche provides important scale and global expertise to bring REGN-COV2 to many more patients in the United States and around the globe.”

Under the terms of the agreement, each company has committed to dedicate a certain manufacturing capacity to REGN-COV2 each year, and the collaborators have already begun the technology transfer process. Each company will bear its own distribution expenses in their designated territories. The collaborators will jointly fund and execute the ongoing Phase 3 prevention and Phase 1 healthy volunteers safety studies as well as additional global studies to evaluate further the potential for REGN-COV2 in treating or preventing COVID-19. Roche will be primarily responsible for securing regulatory approvals outside the U.S., following the initial European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval, and conducting any additional studies specifically required for approval by regulators outside the U.S.

About REGN-COV2
REGN-COV2 was designed specifically by Regeneron scientists to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. They evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company’s proprietary VelocImmune® mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies identified from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that form REGN-COV2 bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in recent Science publications.

REGN-COV2’s development, manufacturing and clinical trials have been funded in part by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with varying developments from country to country and we are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients receive the tests, treatment and care they need. This partnership is an additional step in Roche’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already included:

Launching COVID-19 diagnostic tests for active infection and the detection of antibodies in patients who have been exposed to the virus,
Investigating treatments from our existing portfolio to better understand their potential to treat patients with COVID-19,
Increasing manufacturing and supply chain capacity to meet product demand across our portfolio within the wider context of COVID-19 treatment, and
Ensuring the supply of our existing medicines and diagnostics to patients around the world under exceptional conditions.
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 13 March we received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Also in June we received an FDA EUA for the Elecsys® IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as launching Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are researching options for the future. Roche has an ongoing clinical trial program evaluating the role of Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) in COVID-19 pneumonia. On 29 July we announced that the COVACTA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient mortality. The study was the first global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial investigating Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Roche remains committed to continuing the Actemra/RoActemra clinical trial programme in COVID-19 to further explore Actemra/RoActemra in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral. In addition to COVACTA, Roche has initiated several studies to further investigate Actemra/RoActemra as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including two phase III clinical trials, REMDACTA and EMPACTA, as well as the phase II MARIPOSA trial. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

46085,Sanofi's Dupixent (dupilumab) Receives the Health Canada Approval for Severe Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis,DUPIXENT (dupilumab injection) now approved by Health Canada for severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis,"The Health Canada has approved a new indication as an add-on maintenance treatment with intranasal corticosteroids in patients with CRSwNP, inadequately controlled by systemic corticosteroids or surgery
 The approval is based on P-III studies (24wks. SINUS-24 and 52wks. SINUS-52) assessing Dupixent (300mg, q2w) + SOC intranasal corticosteroids vs PBO + intranasal corticosteroids. The studies demonstrated improvement in its 1EPs and 2EPs @24wks.
 The approval makes the Dupixent first approved biologic in Canada for CRSwNP. Dupixent is a fully mAb inhibiting the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 proteins and is not an immunosuppressant","First biologic approved in Canada for adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)1
Third indication for DUPIXENT® in Canada following moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents2
MISSISSAUGA, ON, Aug. 18, 2020 /CNW/ – Sanofi Canada announced today that Health Canada approved a new indication for DUPIXENT® (dupilumab injection), as an add-on maintenance treatment with intranasal corticosteroids in adult patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) inadequately controlled by systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery,3 making it the first biologic for the treatment of this disease in Canada.4

CRSwNP is a chronic, type 2 inflammatory disease of the upper airway that obstructs the sinuses and nasal passages. It can lead to breathing difficulties, nasal congestion and discharge, reduced or loss of sense of smell and taste and facial pressure.5

“At Sanofi Genzyme, we are committed to making a difference for patients by introducing innovative therapies that address unmet needs. The approval of Dupixent® for CRSwNP provides patients with the first biologic treatment to address the type 2 inflammation that underlies this debilitating disease,” says Marissa Poole, Country Lead, Sanofi Canada and General Manager, Sanofi Genzyme Canada.

DUPIXENT® is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) proteins6 and is not an immunosuppressant. Data from DUPIXENT® clinical trials have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis and CRSwNP.

“Current standard of care therapies for CRSwNP use combinations of intranasal and systemic corticosteroids, with endoscopic sinus surgery, or ESS, used to treat patients not controlled by medication. Unfortunately, surgery is not universally effective, and in certain instances, disease can recur in as little as six months after surgery,“ says Dr. Martin Desrosiers, Clinical Professor, Program Director, ORL-HNS, Université de Montréal. “Until now, therapeutic options for patients with surgery-unresponsive disease has been repeat surgery, with some patients undergoing as many as 10 previous surgeries. In clinical trials, DUPIXENT® has shown the capacity to control disease in this hard to treat group of patients, without resorting to surgery. The availability of DUPIXENT® thus provides a welcome new treatment option to help Canadian patients living with the burden of uncontrolled CRSwNP.”

About the DUPIXENT® Clinical Program

The Health Canada approval is based on two pivotal Phase 3 trials (the 24-week SINUS-24 and 52-week SINUS-52) that evaluated DUPIXENT® 300 mg every two weeks plus standard-of-care intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo plus intranasal corticosteroids.7 In these trials, patients treated with DUPIXENT® achieved statistically significant improvements in all primary and secondary endpoints at 24 weeks.8 Treatment effects on nasal congestion and loss of smell were observed with the first assessment at 4 weeks and showed continued improvement for the duration of the trials.9 In the CRSwNP clinical trials, the common (at least 1%) adverse events in the DUPIXENT® group were inflammation of the eye and eyelids (conjunctivitis), high count of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia), injection site reactions and injection site swelling.10

About DUPIXENT®

DUPIXENT® was first approved by Health Canada on November 30, 2017 and remains the only biologic medicine for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable.11 In September 2019, Health Canada expanded the approval to include adolescents aged 12 years and older.12

DUPIXENT® is jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.

46095,Johnson & Johnson to Acquire Momenta Pharmaceuticals for $6.5B,"Johnson & Johnson to Acquire Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Expanding Janssen’s Leadership in Novel Treatments for Autoimmune Diseases","J&J acquires Momenta in all-cash transaction at a price of $52.50/ share, making a total deal value as $6.5B. The transaction is expected to be closed in H2’20
 The acquisition allows J&J to expand its portfolio for autoimmune diseases with the addition of Momenta’s Nipocalimab (M281) to its pipeline. In addition to nipocalimab, Janssen will acquire Momenta’s pipeline of clinical and pre-clinical assets
 Janssen plans to retain Momenta’s presence in Cambridge, Massachusetts which will increase J&J footprint and capabilities in the key innovation hub. Nipocalimab provides an opportunity for Janssen to deliver transformative treatments in autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases","NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Aug. 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases, in an all cash transaction for approximately $6.5 billion.

This acquisition provides an opportunity for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson to broaden its leadership in immune-mediated diseases and drive further growth through expansion into autoantibody-driven disease. The transaction will include full global rights to nipocalimab (M281), a clinically validated, potentially best-in-class anti-FcRn antibody. Nipocalimab gives Janssen the opportunity to reach significantly more patients by pursuing indications across many autoimmune diseases with substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Nipocalimab recently received a rare pediatric disease designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Momenta’s expertise in FcRn mechanisms is especially important for nipocalimab as it supports and accelerates the development of a medicine designed to target a number of autoantibody-driven conditions across several of Janssen’s established therapeutic areas. Janssen expects nipocalimab to contribute to its goals of achieving above-market growth over the mid and long term.

Autoimmune diseases driven partially or completely by autoantibodies represent a novel area where Janssen can significantly improve health outcomes for patients. In autoantibody-driven diseases, the body’s antibodies attack or damage its own proteins, cells and tissues, often with devastating consequences. Autoantibody-driven diseases include Myasthenia Gravis, Hemolytic Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn, warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia, and other serious dermatologic, rheumatic, neurologic, hematologic and renal diseases. An estimated 2.5 percent of the population, or approximately 195 million people worldwide, suffer from some form of autoantibody-driven disease, many of which are orphan and rare diseases.

With competitively differentiated, parallel development programs and full worldwide commercial rights for nipocalimab, Janssen will have the potential to introduce multiple  launches, many as first-in-class indications with potential for significant peak year sales, some of which could exceed $1 billion, supporting Janssen’s goal of continuing to deliver above-market performance over the long term.

“This acquisition broadens Janssen’s leadership in autoimmune diseases and provides us with a major catalyst for sustained growth. Autoantibody-driven diseases are often serious, and patients are underserved by current treatment options,” said Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson. “We’re excited by the opportunity to further advance patient care by combining Johnson & Johnson’s world-class R&D, commercial and supply chain capabilities with Momenta’s talented people, pipeline and deep expertise in this important area.”

In addition to Momenta’s employees and lead asset nipocalimab, Janssen will acquire Momenta’s pipeline of clinical and pre-clinical assets. The acquisition was driven by the significant opportunity seen in nipocalimab, along with the scientific capability Janssen is acquiring with the Momenta team. Janssen’s plans for additional assets in the Momenta pipeline will be determined as more data become available and could offer further upside potential.

“Nipocalimab, and the rest of Momenta’s pipeline, built over many years by outstanding scientists who have turned important insights into actionable biology, expands and complements our portfolio by giving us clinical-stage and discovery-stage compounds in autoantibody biological pathways. Combining Momenta’s discoveries with our 20-year heritage in immunology, global scope, and scientific and medical expertise, we see a real opportunity to create an entire ‘pipeline in a pathway,'” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. “We are excited about the significant potential to expand on Momenta’s excellent progress in rare diseases, and to increase our impact on patients both within and beyond our current focus areas.”

Janssen plans to retain Momenta’s presence in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This site will increase Johnson & Johnson’s existing innovation footprint and capabilities in the greater Boston area given Momenta’s talented scientists, suite of proprietary technologies, sophisticated laboratories and proximity to top talent in this innovation hub.

About the Agreement
Under the terms of the transaction, which was approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Vigor Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub), a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (the Company), will commence a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Momenta for $52.50 per share. The closing of the offer is conditioned on the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Momenta’s common stock on a fully diluted basis, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The $6.1 billion estimated net value of the transaction is based on Momenta’s estimated fully diluted shares outstanding, less estimated net cash at time of closing. Assuming the closing of the tender offer, the Company will acquire any shares of Momenta not tendered into the tender offer through a merger of Merger Sub with and into Momenta for the same per share consideration as will be payable in the tender offer. The merger will be effected as soon as practicable after the closing of the tender offer. Following completion of the merger, Momenta’s common stock will no longer be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020. While the closing of the transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive, the Company is maintaining its current 2020 Adjusted EPSi guidance range. Looking ahead, the costs associated with the development of Momenta’s portfolio are expected to be incremental to planned R&D investment levels over the next few years given the value creation potential of our current portfolio, and thus expect this incremental investment in R&D to have an EPS impact worth approximately $0.10–$0.15 in 2021. The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination.

About Janssen’s Approach to Autoimmune Disease
Janssen has pioneered breakthrough science in autoimmune diseases with five approved therapies to treat more than 30 pediatric and adult indications. Significant unmet need remains, since many autoimmune diseases have few or no approved treatments, and only a small fraction of those living with autoimmune disease ever achieve sustained clinical remission.

Janssen pursues research and development in both functional manifestations of disease (disease area strongholds) and biological pathways (pathway area strongholds). Biological pathways identify mechanisms through which seemingly dissimilar diseases can be connected by genetic, molecular or cellular systems in the body. It is now understood that multiple, diverse autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical need are linked by the same immune pathways.

Janssen’s pathways-centric strategy opens the door to fully develop compounds for multiple diseases sharing a common pathway, thus challenging the concept of one drug for one disease. In addition, as scientific understanding of the immune system expands, there is increasing recognition of its impact on more diseases than previously understood.

46114,Roche's Tecentriq + Bevacizumab Receive Health Canada's Approval as 1L Treatment for Unresectable or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Health Canada grants market authorization for Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab, the first immunotherapy combination treatment, for the most common form of liver cancer","The approval is based on P-III IMbrave150 study assessing Tecentriq (1200 mg) + bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, q3w, IV) vs sorafenib (400mg, bid) in 501 patients in a ratio (2:1) with unresectable or metastatic HCC, prior not treated with systemic therapies
 Results: 42% reduction in risk of death (OS); 41% reduction the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS); @primary analysis, median survival follow up time (8.6mos.); 7.6mos. delay in median time to deterioration of patient-reported QoL
 The approval is part of Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA’s OCE which provides a framework for simultaneous submission and review of oncology products among international partners","Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to the previous standard of care[3]

MISSISSAUGA, ON, Aug. 19, 2020 /CNW/ – Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (Roche Canada) today announced that Health Canada has granted market authorization for Tecentriq (atezolizumab for injection), in combination with bevacizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who require systemic therapy.[4]

HCC is one of the fastest rising cancers in Canada with incidence rates almost tripling since the early 1980s.[5] In 2019, an estimated 3,000 Canadians were diagnosed with liver cancer[6] and of those, HCC was the most common form.[7] Liver cancer is often diagnosed at the advanced stage of the disease[8] resulting in limited treatment options and poor prognosis.[9],[10] On average, 5-year survival rates are 19%,[11] which underscores the need for new effective treatment options. The main risk factors for liver cancer are chronic liver disease and cirrhosis caused by viral hepatitis and excessive alcohol intake.[12]

The Canadian authorization was granted by Health Canada as a part of Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) which provides a framework for simultaneous submission and review of oncology products among international partners.[13] This important initiative gives international regulators the ability to provide patients with cancer, like those with HCC, access to pivotal products sooner.[14] Simultaneous applications were submitted in Canada, the United States, Australia and Singapore.

The approval of Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab is likely to change clinical practice for many patients with previously untreated unresectable HCC,” said Dr. Jennifer Knox, Staff Medical Oncologist, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto. “I’m pleased that for the first time in over a decade I am able to offer patients a new therapy that data indicates can delay progression and improve overall survival in a more meaningful way for my patients.”

This authorization is based on results from the randomized Phase III IMbrave 150 study.[15] The study showed Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab reduced the risk of death (overall survival; OS) by 42% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.58; 95% CI: 0.42-0.79; p=0.0006) and reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival; PFS) by 41% (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.47-0.76; p<0.0001), compared with sorafenib,[16] the current standard of care for the treatment of HCC in Canada.[17]

IMbrave150 is the first Phase III cancer immunotherapy study to show an improvement in OS and PFS in people with unresectable HCC compared with sorafenib. This marks the first time in more than a decade that a new treatment showed a significant improvement and a clinical benefit over standard of care for patients with unresectable HCC.[18]

“Hepatocellular carcinoma is a fast-growing cancer in Canada and one often diagnosed late and is without multiple treatment options,” said Jackie Manthorne, President and CEO, Canadian Cancer Survivors Network. “We are pleased to see this combination gain approval in Canada providing new and important treatment options for patients.”

About the IMbrave150 study
IMbrave150 is a global Phase III, randomized, multi-center, open-label study, conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab, in patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC, who have not received prior systemic treatment. A total of 501 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either Tecentriq 1,200 mg and 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab every three weeks administered via IV infusion, or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice per day.[19]

The co-primary efficacy endpoints as assessed by an independent review facility (IRF) were OS and PFS according to evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST v1.1). At the time of the primary analysis, patients had a median survival follow up time of 8.6 months. The data demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS as assessed by IRF per RECIST v1.1 with Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab compared to sorafenib. A statistically significant improvement was also observed in confirmed objective response rate (ORR).[20]

The study findings also demonstrated a 7.6-month delay in median time to deterioration of patient-reported quality of life (a predefined descriptive secondary endpoint) with Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab compared with sorafenib (11.2 versus 3.6 months; HR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.46–.85).[21]

The most common adverse reactions (≥10 %) in the IMbrave150 study included: hypertension (29.8%), fatigue (20.4%), pyrexia (17.9%), proteinuria (20.1%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (19.5%), alanine aminotransferase increased (14%), blood bilirubin increased (13.1%), weight decreased (11.2%), platelet count decreased (10.6%), pruritus (19.5%), rash (12.5%), diarrhea (18.8%), constipation (13.4%) , abdominal pain (12.2%), nausea (12.25), vomiting (10%), decreased appetite (17.6%), cough (11.9%), epistaxis (10.3%), infusion related reaction (11.2%).[22]

About the Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) and bevacizumab combination
There is a strong scientific rationale to support the use of Tecentriq plus bevacizumab in combination. The combination may enhance the ability of the immune system to combat a broad range of cancers. Bevacizumab, in addition to its established anti-angiogenic effects, may further enhance Tecentriq’s ability to restore anti-cancer immunity, by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related immunosuppression, promoting T-cell tumour infiltration and enabling priming and activation of T-cell responses against tumour antigens.[23]

About Tecentriq® (atezolizumab)
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to directly bind to PD-L1 expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells. This blocks the interactions of PD-L1 with other cell-surface receptors which regulate the activation or suppression of T-cells.[24]

Roche has a development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.[25]

In Canada, Tecentriq is authorized in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) for the first-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, as well as in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) for the first-line treatment of people with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations, and no prior systemic chemotherapy treatment for metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Tecentriq is also authorized for the treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations should have disease progression on a therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving Tecentriq. It is also authorized in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy. In addition, Tecentriq is authorized conditionally and is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression with 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing therapy. It is also conditionally authorized in combination with chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumours have PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, and who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

46161,Fitbit Reports Results of its COVID-19 Study for Early Detection of Diseases,Early Findings from Fitbit COVID-19 Study Suggest Fitbit Devices Can Identify Signs of Disease at Its Earliest Stages,"In May’2020, Fitbit has launched its COVID-19 study to build an algorithm that detects COVID-19 before symptoms starts. The study has enrolled 1000+ positive patients across the US and Canada is now delivering its first, preliminary results 90 days later
 The study demonstrated that its devices could detect ~50% of COVID-19 cases one day before participants reported the onset of symptoms such as fever, cough, or muscle aches
 The algorithm is under development and worked with 70% specificity, or a 30% rate of false positives. The study reinforces that breathing rate, resting heart rate and HRV are all useful metrics for indicating onset of illness and are best tracked at night, when the body is at rest","The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of staying healthy, and our mission to help people live healthier lives has never been more important. Since the start of this global health crisis, the Fitbit research team has been diligently working to help make a difference in the fight against COVID-19. This includes accelerating work on early disease detection, an effort led by our team of data scientists with deep expertise in machine learning and predictive modeling.

In May, we announced the launch of the Fitbit COVID-19 study aimed at building an algorithm that detects COVID-19 before symptoms start. In just over two months, more than 100,000 Fitbit users across the US and Canada have enrolled, with more than 1,000 positive cases of the virus reported. This study presents an exciting opportunity to see how the power of the Fitbit community will help us better understand this new and complex disease. If you’re interested in contributing to this research, you can join here or in the Assessments & Discover tab in the Fitbit app.

Because data to help detect COVID-19 is of critical global importance, we’ve submitted our early research for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. While we work to finalize the publication, we have made the full manuscript publicly available as a preprint, which allows us to share some of the preliminary findings.

Early Findings From Fitbit COVID-19 Study
So far, we’re encouraged to see physiological signs of disease detected by Fitbit devices simultaneously with study participants’ reporting the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and in some cases even before.

Based on the findings of our study, we can detect nearly 50 percent of COVID-19 cases one day before participants reported the onset of symptoms with 70 percent specificity.

This is important because people can transmit the virus before they realize they have symptoms or when they have no symptoms at all. If we can let people know they should get tested a day before symptoms begin, they can isolate and seek care sooner, helping to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

As researchers, we are always working to find a balance between sensitivity (alerting people who may be sick) and specificity (the ability to identify people who are healthy), as there are trade-offs to both. We will continue to work with the clinical and public health communities to evaluate different models for developing this technology to ensure the optimal balance.

Our study also reinforces that breathing rate, resting heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) are all useful metrics for indicating onset of illness and are best tracked at night, when the body is at rest. Our research shows that HRV, which is the beat-to-beat variation of the heart, often decreases in people who are exhibiting symptoms of illness, while resting heart rate and breathing rate are often elevated. In some cases, those metrics begin to signal changes nearly a week before participants reported symptoms.

Other findings include:

On average, heart rate variability hits its lowest point the day after symptoms are reported
Increases in resting heart rate normalize, on average, at least 5–7 days after the start of symptoms
Breathing rate peaks typically on day 2 of symptoms, but there is a slight elevation, on average, for up to 3 weeks after symptoms start

Understanding Symptoms and Severity of COVID-19
In addition to detecting early signals of COVID-19, we also are gleaning some insights into common symptoms, as well as severity, duration of illness and the symptoms most likely linked to hospitalization. Many of these observations align with what we’re hearing from other researchers and public health officials. For example, being older, male, or having a high BMI increases the likelihood of severe outcomes.

In addition, our study found that shortness of breath and vomiting are the symptoms most likely to predict that someone with COVID-19 will need to be hospitalized, while sore throat and stomachache were the symptoms least likely to predict the need for hospitalization.

We’re also seeing that the most common symptom reported by individuals with COVID-19 was fatigue, which was present in 72 percent of participants reporting having COVID-19. This was followed by headache (65 percent), body ache (63 percent), decrease in taste and smell (60 percent), and cough (59 percent). Of note, fever was present in just 55 percent of people reporting COVID-19, an indicator that temperature screening alone may not be enough to understand who might be infected.

Mild cases (those who recovered at home on their own) show a median duration of 8 days, while moderate cases (those who recovered at home with help from others) last about a week longer, with a median duration of 15 days. For severe cases (patients who end up requiring hospitalization), the median duration of illness was approximately 24 days. But this duration had a large spread, with several cases lasting longer than two months.


What’s Next for the Fitbit COVID-19 Study
It’s clear that our bodies start to signal impacts from the disease before more noticeable symptoms appear. With these initial signals identified, we’ll continue our work in developing an algorithm to detect diseases like COVID-19 and focus on expanded research in a real-world environment.

Early detection is critical, and we hope to bring this type of information to consumers as soon as possible. As a next step, we’ll continue to work with our research partners like Scripps Research Translational Institute and Stanford Healthcare Innovation Lab to further validate the technology and intend to engage with the appropriate regulators globally to determine the best path to bring this to consumers.

 The two-step process uses advanced QIAseq technologies to conduct reverse transcription and cDNA synthesis from a viral RNA sample, then generate libraries compatible with Illumina sequencing platforms
 The solution aims to accelerate research into COVID-19 prevention and treatment by enabling deeper and more holistic insights into the biology of SARS-CoV-2","• QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel converts viral RNA samples into libraries ready for sequencing
• QIAGEN Digital Insights solutions support COVID-19 drug, vaccine and epidemiology research
Hilden, Germany, and Germantown, Maryland, August 18, 2020 – QIAGEN (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) launched the innovative QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel for next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the novel coronavirus genome, along with integrated analysis and interpretation workflows for insights into the evolution and spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. The new products are an expansion of QIAGEN’s broad offering of sample technologies, diagnostic tests and instruments, and research tools for use in the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

“These solutions aim to accelerate research into COVID-19 prevention and treatment by enabling deeper, more holistic insights into the biology of SARS-CoV-2. The more we understand the novel coronavirus and its development, the better equipped the world will be to stop the pandemic,” said Thierry Bernard, Chief Executive Officer of QIAGEN. “We are partnering with leading institutes and companies to accelerate this vital research. Our new QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel and software pipeline will guide researchers into insights on the epidemiology, metatranscriptomics, immune response and pathways of the coronavirus – contributing to drug and vaccine development and public health strategies.”

QIAGEN’s new QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel provides optimized, single-day workflows to prepare libraries for sequencing as researchers use NGS to track viral genome changes in studying the epidemiology of virus outbreaks. The two-step process uses advanced QIAseq technologies to conduct reverse transcription and cDNA synthesis from a viral RNA sample, then generate libraries compatible with Illumina sequencing platforms. The workflow is faster and has lower-input requirements compared to hybrid capture solutions.

The panel is supported with software pipelines tailored to SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis using QIAGEN’s CLC Genomics Workbench. The optimized and configurable pipelines allow researchers to identify viral genome sequence variation across samples, and to visualize strain divergence across populations and geographies using phylogenetic approaches. QIAGEN also provides a complete Sample to Insight SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing Service covering all aspects of the workflow, from RNA isolation to NGS library preparation and data analysis.

The first independent study using the new QIAGEN workflows, an analysis of COVID-19 epidemiology in India, has been published in the Journal of Biosciences. The study used QIAGEN’s QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit for extraction of RNA. Researchers used the QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel for viral genome amplification in samples that did not generate sufficient NGS reads, converting the RNA to double-stranded cDNA and amplifying it, then generating libraries for sequencing on an Illumina instrument. The sequences were assembled and analyzed using QIAGEN CLC Genomics Workbench. The full study can be found at https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/045/0076.

“We urgently need more research into the evolution of this virus. As we found in eastern India, mutations are emerging in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that might modulate viral transmission, replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world. Genomic research is required to improve understanding of transmission patterns, tracking of the outbreak and formulation of effective containment measures,” said Dr. Arindam Maitra, Associate Professor at the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics in India, one of the authors. “We found that a viral genome amplification method like the QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel was ideal for looking at low copy number, or high CT samples when compared to other methods.”

As a global leader in NGS solutions for evaluation of microbiomes and metagenomics, QIAGEN also offers a complete QIAseq workflow to expedite metatranscriptomics research and efficiently decipher the complex interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the host and its microbiota. A recently published study by Shah, S.J., et al. (2020) has illustrated the application of QIAseq FastSelect rRNA removal technology in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 metatranscriptomics, leading to a more comprehensive evaluation of co-infection rates in COVID-19 patients.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, QIAGEN’s initiatives focus on building the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions for COVID-19 testing. These include ramping up production of viral RNA extraction for use on QIAGEN’s QIAcube, QIAsymphony and EZ1 platforms as well as third-party instruments; building up a range of PCR tests on the QIAstat-Dx and NeuMoDx systems that enable COVID-19 detection while analyzing samples at the same time for other respiratory infections; and delivering universal next-generation sequencing (NGS) solutions for use with any sequencer, in particular gene panels like the QIAseq SARS-CoV-2, which are integrated with bioinformatics for analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. QIAGEN is also scaling up production capacity for reagents sold to other companies for use in their own COVID-19 tests.

Additional in-vitro experiments demonstrated the complete virus neutralizing property of STI-1499 against the highly contagious D614G SARS-CoV-2 variant.
Sorrento has initiated cGMP manufacturing to produce 50,000 doses, expected to be available by the end of this year, in anticipation of a potential EUA.
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 19, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) announced that it is filing an investigational new drug application (IND) for COVI-GUARD (STI-1499) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients today.

Sorrento has previously received guidance from the FDA in response to a pre-IND meeting package and believes it has addressed all questions and followed the recommendations from the agency for all sections of the IND.

As Sorrento previously announced, in preclinical studies, STI-1499 demonstrated 100% neutralizing effect (in vitro) of the antibody and that a low dose prevented SARS-CoV-2 from infecting healthy cells in such preclinical in vitro studies.

Animal data generated by Dr. Paessler’s laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) in Syrian Golden Hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, justify the IND filing and continued clinical development. This established model, while limited, is the most predictive animal model currently available for this disease. The data were presented to federal agencies and will be published as soon as possible in a scientific journal.

The highest proposed dose (200 mg per patient) in the phase 1 safety trial is a much lower dose than currently being tested for other known antibodies in active clinical studies. The potentially higher potency of the antibody may allow for faster scaled manufacturing (availability to patients) and potentially a lower cost per dose as compared to other known antibodies currently being evaluated.

STI-1499 antibody has also been evaluated in preclinical studies against multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2, including the highly contagious D614G mutant, the current dominant strain globally. In such preclinical studies, the antibody has been 100% effective against the highly contagious D614G mutant strain at a low dose.

More information about the phase 1 clinical trial can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT# 04454398).

 PBCAR0191 is an allogenic CART cell therapy, currently being evaluated in a P-I/IIa study evaluating PBCAR0191 in adult patients with r/r B-ALL and r/r NHL","DURHAM, N.C., Aug. 19, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Precision BioSciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: DTIL), a clinical stage biotechnology company dedicated to improving life with its novel and proprietary ARCUS® genome editing platform, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation to Precision for PBCAR0191, the company’s lead investigational allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR T) cell therapy for the treatment of advanced B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).

“Fast Track Designation is intended to fill an unmet medical need by accelerating the development of agents for patients in need of potentially better therapeutic options,” said Chris Heery, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Precision BioSciences. “We continue to work toward demonstrating that PBCAR0191, as well as our other two allogeneic CAR T clinical programs, may play a role in the treatment paradigm of advanced malignancies in the future. We believe the balance of safety and efficacy plus the accessibility of allogeneic cell therapies may fill a void left by autologous CAR T therapies. This designation provides more flexibility as we attempt to identify the optimal patient population in which to seek regulatory approval.”

About Fast Track Designation
Fast Track designation facilitates the expedited development and review of a new drug, whether alone or in combination with another drug that may address unmet medical needs and treats a serious or life-threatening disease. Benefits of this designation include more frequent engagements with the FDA to discuss the drug’s clinical development plan, eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, and a Rolling Review in which Precision can submit completed sections of its New Drug Application (NDA) for review by the FDA rather than waiting to complete the NDA before it can be submitted for review.

About the PBCAR0191 Clinical Trial
PBCAR0191 is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with R/R B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The NHL cohort includes patients with mantle cell lymphoma, an aggressive subtype of NHL, for which the FDA previously granted Orphan Drug Designation. PBCAR0191 is being developed in collaboration with Servier, an international pharmaceutical company. For more information, visit www.clinicaltrials.gov, study identifier number NCT03666000.

About Precision’s Allogeneic CAR T Platform
Precision is advancing a pipeline of cell-phenotype optimized allogeneic CAR T therapies, leveraging fully scaled, proprietary manufacturing processes. The platform is designed to maximize the number of patients who can potentially benefit from CAR T therapy. Precision carefully selects high-quality T cells derived from healthy donors as starting material, then utilizes its unique ARCUS genome editing technology to modify the cells via a single-step engineering process. By inserting the CAR gene at the T cell receptor (TCR) locus, this process knocks in the CAR while knocking out the TCR, creating a consistent product that can be reliably and rapidly manufactured that is designed to prevent graft-versus-host disease. Precision optimizes its CAR T therapy candidates for immune cell expansion in the body by maintaining a high proportion of naïve and central memory CAR T cells throughout the manufacturing process and in the final product.

Basel, August 20, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Kesimpta® (ofatumumab, formerly OMB157) as an injection for subcutaneous use for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that has shown superior efficacy with a similar safety profile compared with teriflunomide and is a first-choice treatment option for RMS patients1. Kesimpta is the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered once monthly at home via the Sensoready® autoinjector pen3.

“This approval is wonderful news for patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In the key clinical studies, this breakthrough treatment produced a profound reduction in new brain lesions, reducing relapses and slowing underlying disease progression1,” said Professor Stephen L. Hauser, Director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and co-chair of the steering committee for the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies. “Through its favorable safety profile and well-tolerated monthly injection regimen, patients can self-administer the treatment at home, avoiding visits to the infusion center1.”

One of the goals when managing RMS is to preserve neurological function to slow down the worsening of disability4. Despite the availability of several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the treatment of RMS, the majority of individuals with RMS continue to experience disease activity5. Evidence suggests early initiation of high-efficacy treatment can improve long-term outcomes for patients with RMS6.

“Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex disease, and response to disease modifying treatment will vary among individuals,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President of Research at the National MS Society. “This makes it important to have a range of treatments available with different mechanisms of action and routes of administration. We are pleased to have an additional option approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS.”

Traditionally, B-cell treatments, which bind to and deplete B-cells associated with disease activity in MS, have predominantly been available in hospitals or infusion treatment centers, which can add costs to the healthcare system and present a lifestyle burden for some patients7,8. Kesimpta provides patients the flexibility of self-administering via once-monthly subcutaneous dosing requiring no premedication, eliminating the need to travel to an infusion center. The positive results from the APLIOS study—an open-label Phase II study to determine the bioequivalence of subcutaneous delivery of Kesimpta via a prefilled syringe and a Sensoready pen in patients with RMS—and the ASCLEPIOS studies show Kesimpta to be a highly effective B-cell therapy that can be easily self-administered at home1,3.

“At Novartis, we challenge treatment paradigms and strive to offer the best treatment choice for patients,” said Marie-France Tschudin, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “When treating patients with RMS, Kesimpta is a meaningful treatment option that delivers both high efficacy and safety with the ability for patients to have more freedom in managing their disease. The development of Kesimpta is a great example of our commitment, knowledge and understanding of multiple sclerosis, which enabled us to identify a targeted treatment that can significantly improve patient outcomes and experience.”

Ofatumumab was first approved by the FDA in 2009 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as an intravenous infusion with a high dose, administered by a healthcare provider. Ofatumumab was then investigated in an entirely new development program in RMS, as B-cells are known to play a critical role in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as MS7. The clinical development program for ofatumumab in RMS took 10 years and has involved more than 2,300 patients around the world as part of rigorous studies that were reflective of the broad patient population. Kesimpta was found to work through a distinct mode of action, and the treatment regimen (dosing)—which was specifically designed for RMS—plays a critical role in the outcome9. This is a different dosing regimen and route of administration than was previously approved for the CLL indication.

The approval of Kesimpta is based on results from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies, in which Kesimpta demonstrated superiority versus teriflunomide in significantly reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR, primary endpoint), 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 and new or enlarging T2 lesions1. Results from these two studies were recently published in the August 6, 2020 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

Kesimpta is expected to be available in the United States in early September.* Additional regulatory filings are currently underway across the world, and regulatory approval for Kesimpta in Europe is expected by Q2 2021.

*Time of availability may vary as healthcare providers integrate Kesimpta into their practices.

About ASCLEPIOS I and II studies
The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies are twin, identical design, flexible duration (up to 30 months), double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Kesimpta 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with RMS. The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies enrolled 1,882 patients with MS, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.51. The studies were conducted in over 350 sites in 37 countries10. Kesimpta demonstrated a significant reduction in ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 59% (0.10 vs 0.25) compared with teriflunomide (P<.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (primary endpoint). Kesimpta also showed a relative risk reduction of 34.4% (P=.002) in 3-month CDP compared with teriflunomide in pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS1.

Kesimpta showed significant reduction of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions. It significantly reduced the mean number of both Gd+ T1 lesions (98% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) and new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% and 85% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) vs teriflunomide1.

Kesimpta had a similar safety profile to teriflunomide, with the frequency of serious infections and malignancies also being similar across both treatment groups1. Upper respiratory tract infection, headache, injection-related reactions, and local injection site reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions with Kesimpta (incidence greater than 10%)1.

A separate post hoc analysis demonstrated Kesimpta may halt new disease activity
in RMS patients. It showed the odds of achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3; no relapses, no MRI lesions, and no disability worsening combined) with ofatumumab versus teriflunomide were >3-fold higher at Months 0–12 (47.0% vs 24.5% of patients; P<.001) and >8-fold higher at Months 12–24 (87.8% vs 48.2% of patients; P<.001)2.

Overall Kesimpta, an antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered superior efficacy and demonstrated a safety profile with infection rates similar to teriflunomide1.

About APLIOS study
The APLIOS study is a 12-week, open-label, Phase II bioequivalence study to determine the onset of B-cell depletion with Kesimpta subcutaneous monthly injections and the bioequivalence of subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta via a prefilled syringe—as used in ASCLEPIOS I and II—and a Sensoready pen in patients with RMS. Patients were randomized according to injection device and site including the abdomen and the thigh. B-cell depletion was measured nine times over 12 weeks and Gd+ lesion counts were assessed at baseline and at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. Regardless of injection device or site, Kesimpta 20 mg subcutaneous monthly injections resulted in rapid, close to complete and sustained B-cell depletion; the proportion of patients with B-cell concentrations of <10 cells/μL was >65% after the first injection by Day 7, 94% by Week 4, and sustained >95% at all following injections. Kesimpta treatment reduced the mean number of Gd+ lesions from baseline (1.5) to 0.8, 0.3 and 0.1 by Weeks 4, 8 and 12, respectively; the proportion of patients free from Gd+ lesions at the corresponding time points were 66.5%, 86.7% and 94.1%, respectively3.

About Kesimpta® (ofatumumab, formerly OMB157)
Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that provides the flexibility of self-administration for adults with RMS. It is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) self-administered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously1,3. Initial loading doses of Kesimpta are given at Weeks 0, 1 and 2, with the first injection performed under the guidance of a healthcare professional. As shown in preclinical studies, Kesimpta is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion9. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and preclinical studies have shown that it may preserve the B-cells in the spleen11. Once-monthly dosing of Kesimpta also allows faster repletion of B-cells and offers more flexibility12. Ofatumumab was originally developed by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 201513.

About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage in the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord14. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide15, can be characterized into four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS)16. The various forms of MS can be distinguished based on whether a patient experiences relapses (clearly defined acute inflammatory attacks of worsening neurological function), and/or whether they experience progression of neurologic damage and disability from the onset of the disease14.

Novartis in Neuroscience
Novartis has a strong ongoing commitment to neuroscience and to bringing innovative treatments to patients suffering from neurological conditions where there is a high unmet need. We are committed to supporting patients and physicians in multiple disease areas, including MS, migraine, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and have a promising pipeline in MS, Alzheimer’s disease, spinal muscular atrophy and specialty neurology.

 The study resulted in statistically significant differences in weekly number of cataplexy attack and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores
 Xywav, also known as JZP-258 is targeted for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. Additionally, the USDEA has designated Xywav as a Schedule III medicine also contains a boxed warning of as a central nervous system depressant","Xywav is the first FDA approved new treatment option indicated for both cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in people living with narcolepsy in more than 15 years 

Xywav contains 92 percent less sodium per nightly dose than sodium oxybate, a current standard of care for this patient population as designated by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Guidelines 

Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder and is associated with an increased prevalence of certain comorbid conditions, including hypertension and cardiovascular disease

DUBLIN, July 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Xywav™ (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution on July 21, 2020 for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy.1,2 Xywav is an oxybate product with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92 percent less sodium – or approximately 1,000 to 1,500 mg/night – than sodium oxybate at the recommended dosage range of 6 to 9 grams.1

The company plans to launch Xywav by the end of the year following Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) implementation. Jazz is committed to ensuring access to our medicines and will work to secure the broadest access possible for appropriate patients.

The FDA approval of Xywav is based on a global Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter study that demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Xywav in the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy. In the study, which enrolled 201 patients, Xywav demonstrated highly statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) in weekly number of cataplexy attacks and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores compared to placebo.3

Multiple Xywav dosing options are available for adult and pediatric patients. Prescribers can titrate Xywav into unequal doses taken over the course of the night. When patients start Xywav after sodium oxybate, Xywav treatment is initiated at the same dose and regimen as sodium oxybate (gram for gram) and titrated as needed based on efficacy and tolerability.1

“Based on the efficacy demonstrated in the clinical program, the approval of Xywav is important for people living with cataplexy or EDS associated with narcolepsy.1 Xywav makes it possible for patients to have a lower-sodium oxybate treatment option. This may help patients taking sodium oxybate better align with daily sodium intake recommendations including those by the American Heart Association,4” said Richard K. Bogan, MD, FCCP, FAASM, associate clinical professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, a medical officer at SleepMed in Columbia, SC and lead investigator of the Phase 3 study. “The average American consumes too much sodium.5 Excess sodium intake has been linked with increases in blood pressure, hypertension, stroke, and other cardiovascular disease.6,7,8,9”

Sodium oxybate carries warnings about its high sodium content,10 and was previously the only product approved to treat both cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy 7 years of age and older11 and designated as a standard of care for the treatment of cataplexy and EDS by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.12 With the goal of establishing a new standard of care, Xywav was developed to provide people with narcolepsy an oxybate therapy with lower sodium, and does not carry warnings about sodium content.

Xywav has a Boxed Warning as a central nervous system depressant, and for its potential for abuse and misuse. Because of the risks of CNS depression and abuse and misuse, Xywav is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the Xywav and Xyrem REMS Program. Most common adverse reactions in adults (≥5%) were headache, nausea, dizziness, decreased appetite, parasomnia, diarrhea, hyperhidrosis, anxiety and vomiting.1

“We have been working for nearly a decade to develop Xywav, a unique oxybate product with a significant reduction in sodium. We are proud to advance the science behind our sleep research program in order to continue making a difference for people living with narcolepsy,” said Bruce Cozadd, chairman and CEO of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. “Jazz is committed to addressing unmet needs in sleep medicine, which includes our innovative and long-standing oxybate program.”

Narcolepsy is a chronic neurologic condition with no cure and the illness burden can have a far-reaching impact on a patient’s health over time.13,14,15,16 As an established leader in sleep medicine, Jazz is commited to raising awareness about narcolepsy and helping patients find strategies to manage this sleep disorder.

“Many people with narcolepsy can go years before being properly diagnosed and this can have a significant impact to their everyday life,” said Julie Flygare, president and CEO of Project Sleep. “Narcolepsy is a life-long condition so it is important to have new options to help treat EDS and cataplexy.”

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has designated Xywav as a Schedule III medicine. The DEA defines Schedule III drugs, substances, or chemicals as drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.17

About Xywav™ (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution
Xywav, also known as JZP-258, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. It is also being studied for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in adult patients. Xywav is comprised of a unique composition of cations resulting in 92 percent less sodium, or approximately 1,000 to 1,500 mg/night, than sodium oxybate at the recommended dosage range of 6 to 9 grams. Xywav has the same oxybate concentration as sodium oxybate and includes a mix of calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium cations. While the exact mechanism of action of Xywav is unknown, it is hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of Xywav on cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness are mediated through GABAB actions during sleep at noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as at thalamocortical neurons.1

Important Safety Information

WARNING: Taking XYWAV with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as medicines used to make you or your child fall asleep, including opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedating anti-epileptic medicines, general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, alcohol, or street drugs, may cause serious medical problems, including trouble breathing (respiratory depression), low blood pressure (hypotension), changes in alertness (drowsiness), fainting (syncope), and death.

The active ingredient of XYWAV is a form of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Abuse or misuse of illegal GHB alone or with other drugs that cause changes in alertness (or consciousness) has caused serious side effects. These effects include seizures, trouble breathing (respiratory depression), changes in alertness (drowsiness), coma, and death. Call your doctor right away if you or your child has any of these serious side effects.

Because of these risks, you have to go through the XYWAV and XYREM REMS Program to have your or your child’s prescription for XYWAV filled.

Do not take XYWAV if you take or your child takes other sleep medicines or sedatives (medicines that cause sleepiness), drinks alcohol, or has a rare problem called succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.

Keep XYWAV in a safe place to prevent abuse and misuse. Selling or giving away XYWAV may harm others, and is against the law. Tell your doctor if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs.

Anyone who takes XYWAV should not do anything that requires them to be fully awake or is dangerous, including driving a car, using heavy machinery, or flying an airplane, for at least 6 hours after taking XYWAV. Those activities should not be done until you know how XYWAV affects you or your child.

XYWAV can cause serious side effects, including the following:

Breathing problems, including slower breathing, trouble breathing, and/or short periods of not breathing while sleeping (sleep apnea). People who already have breathing or lung problems have a higher chance of having breathing problems when they use XYWAV.
Mental health problems, including confusion, seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), unusual or disturbing thoughts (abnormal thinking), feeling anxious or upset, depression, thoughts of killing yourself or trying to kill yourself, increased tiredness, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, or difficulty concentrating. Tell your doctor if you or your child have or had depression or have tried to harm yourself or themselves. Call your doctor right away if you have or your child has symptoms of mental health problems or a change in weight or appetite.
Sleepwalking. Sleepwalking can cause injuries. Call your doctor if you or your child starts sleepwalking. Your doctor should check you or your child.
The most common side effects of XYWAV in adults include headache, nausea, dizziness, decreased appetite, parasomnia (a sleep disorder that can include abnormal dreams, abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, sleep paralysis, sleep talking, sleep terror, sleep-related eating disorder, sleep walking, and other abnormal sleep-related events), diarrhea, excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), anxiety and vomiting.

The most common side effects of XYWAV in children include bedwetting, nausea, headache, vomiting, weight decrease, decreased appetite, and dizziness.

XYWAV can cause physical dependence and craving for the medicine when it is not taken as directed. These are not all the possible side effects of XYWAV.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

About Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by EDS and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.2,15,18 It affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in the United States, with symptoms typically appearing in childhood or adolescence.19,20,21 Studies have shown it may take 10 years or more for people with narcolepsy to receive a diagnosis.22,23 There are five main symptoms of narcolepsy, including EDS, cataplexy, disrupted nighttime sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.24 While all people with narcolepsy experience EDS, not all individuals with narcolepsy experience all five symptoms.15,23 EDS is the primary symptom of narcolepsy and is present in all people with the disorder.21,25 EDS is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in drowsiness and unplanned lapses into sleep.19,21,22 Narcolepsy is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.13,14,26,27

 

About Cataplexy
Cataplexy, the most specific symptom of narcolepsy, is the sudden, generally brief (<2 minutes) loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness. It is usually triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter, surprise, or anger.19,21 Although many emotions can potentially trigger cataplexy, those associated with mirth are usually the most potent.21 Cataplexy occurs in about 70 percent of people with narcolepsy.29 Presentation differs widely among people with narcolepsy, ranging from sporadic partial attacks triggered by laughter to frequent complete collapse brought about by a variety of emotions.19,21 Complete collapse is less common.19,21 More commonly, episodes of cataplexy involve only certain muscle groups, such as arms and legs (e.g., knees buckling), the head and neck (e.g., head dropping), or the face and jaw (e.g., sagging, slurred speech, eyelid drooping).19,21,28,29

 The study resulted in a PGA treatment of 21.6% vs 14.6%, patients achieved at least a 4-point improvement in the peak pruritus NRS score at @4wks. 60.3% vs 21.4%
 Wynzora is a novel topical solution offering high efficacy, favorable safety and excellent and is filled for MAA application in EU","COPENHAGEN, Denmark, July 22, 2020 / B3C newswire / — MC2 Therapeutics, a commercial stage pharmaceutical company developing a new standard of topical therapies for chronic inflammatory conditions, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Wynzora® Cream (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate, w/w 0.005%/0.064%) for once-daily topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults 18 years of age or older.

The FDA approval is based on the results of the US Phase 3 clinical trial (1) against active comparator Taclonex® Topical Suspension (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate, w/w 0.005%/0.064%). A total of 794 patients were randomized in this trial and the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with PGA treatment success at week 8 defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in PGA to “clear” or “almost clear”. The difference in PGA treatment success to the active comparator was 14.6% (95% CI; 7.6%, 21.6%) in favor of Wynzora® Cream.

Reduction of itch as defined by at least a 4-point improvement in the 11-point peak pruritus numeric rating scale (NRS) from baseline to week 4 was assessed among patients who had at least a peak pruritus NRS score of 4 at baseline. A higher proportion of patients achieved at least a 4-point improvement in the peak pruritus NRS score at week 4 in the Wynzora® Cream group (60.3%) compared to vehicle (21.4%).

“Wynzora® Cream is a novel topical treatment for plaque psoriasis which offers a unique combination of high efficacy, favorable safety and excellent treatment convenience in a single product,” said Linda Stein Gold, MD, Director of Dermatology Clinical Research at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan, and lead principal investigator in the study.

Studies show that more than half of psoriasis patients are dissatisfied with their treatment and that a large proportion of patients are not treated at all (2).

“The FDA approval marks an important milestone for patients with plaque psoriasis”, stated Jesper J. Lange, CEO of MC2 Therapeutics and continued: “Our PAD™ Technology has uniquely enabled us to develop Wynzora® Cream with no compromises.

About Plaque Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a common, non-contagious, chronic skin disease, with no clear cause or cure. The negative impact of plaque psoriasis on people’s lives can be immense as it affects the appearance of the skin with red, scaly plaques. According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, itch is present in between 70 and 90 percent of psoriasis patients, and together with flaking and scaling, itching is the most burdensome symptom to patients (3,4,5). The appearance of flares of psoriasis can be unpredictable and affects people of all ages. With a reported prevalence of 2-4% of the population psoriasis constitutes a serious health problem with more than 100 million individuals affected worldwide. More than 90% of patients receiving treatment use topical drugs. Patients with psoriatic disease are at an elevated risk of developing other chronic and serious health conditions, including arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease and depression (5).

— Company to host Investor Call at 10:00 a.m. ET today to discuss approval, key elements of the clinical data and commercial plans —

BRIDGEWATER, N.J, July 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: OSMT) (“Osmotica” or the “Company”), a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Upneeq (oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution), 0.1%, formerly known as RVL-1201, its novel treatment for acquired blepharoptosis, or ptosis, a condition characterized by the abnormal drooping of the upper eyelid that can limit field of vision. Upneeq becomes the only FDA-approved medical treatment for ptosis.

The Company believes that millions of people have ptosis in the United States alone, and an even larger population may be affected in Europe, Japan and China. One study comprising adults over the age of 50 indicates prevalence of ptosis is ~11.5% of adult patients over the age of 501. Upneeq is a safe and effective, first-in-class treatment for acquired ptosis, which often results from a partial or complete dysfunction of Müller’s muscle, which in conjunction with the Levator superioris, elevates the eyelid. Upneeq demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared to placebo in both superior visual field, as measured by the Leicester Peripheral Field Test (LPFT), and eyelid lift, as measured by the Marginal Reflex Distance Test (MRD-1) in two pivotal double-masked efficacy studies. A third pivotal safety study successfully showed that Upneeq was well tolerated when administered once daily in the morning (to both eyes) over a 12-week period. The majority of adverse events were mild and self-limited.

“With the approval of Upneeq, eye care specialists now have a safe and convenient non-surgical option to treat their patients who have ptosis. Upneeq has garnered a great deal of interest from ophthalmic physicians and key opinion leaders, or KOLs, and we are prepared to commercialize Upneeq and engage providers through our medical education outreach. We look forward to launching Upneeq through our subsidiary, RVL Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and ensuring its widespread availability through the Company’s pharmacy,” stated Brian Markison, Chief Executive Officer.

“Upneeq’s safety and efficacy profile and its once-a-day dosing provides a significant ophthalmic therapeutic innovation. Given the previous absence of any approved medical treatment options, ptosis has been often under-diagnosed or overlooked. Upneeq has the potential to address a significant unmet need in ptosis therapy,” stated Tina deVries, Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Research and Development.

“This approval marks a critical milestone for Osmotica, as we continue to execute our corporate strategy. Looking ahead, we see Upneeq as a significant growth catalyst and an important opportunity to bring value to our shareholders while addressing a significant unmet medical need with a first-in-class product,” concluded Markison.

Osmotica plans to make Upneeq commercially available next month to a selected group of ophthalmologists and optometrists through an early experience program.

The Company remains actively engaged in discussions with ex-U.S. partners to commercialize Upneeq in markets beyond the U.S.

Clinical Studies

Results from Upneeq’s initial Phase III efficacy clinical trial showed that the formulation met its primary efficacy endpoints, which were a change in baseline visual field as measured by the LPFT, on Hour 6, Day 1 (p=0.0003) and Hour 2, Day 14 (p< 0.0001). Patients who received Upneeq once daily experienced a statistically significant improvement in visual field when compared to the placebo group. The 2:1 randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study was comprised of 140 patients with acquired blepharoptosis split into two treatment groups for 42 days.

Upneeq was well tolerated by patients in this clinical trial when administered once daily over a six-week period. There were no serious adverse events identified from treatment with Upneeq in this Phase III clinical trial.

The second Phase III efficacy trial was a six-week randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-daily treatment of Upneeq compared with placebo for the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis. The primary endpoint for both trials was a measurement of the mean change from baseline of the number of points seen out of a total of 35 in the top four rows of the LPFT as measured in two time points: Hour 6, Day 1 and Hour 2, day 14. The secondary endpoint was a measurement of the distance between the center of the pupillary light reflex and the upper eyelid margin, or MRD-1. Topline results from the second Phase III efficacy trial showed that the trial met both the primary and secondary endpoints. The mean change from baseline on the LPFT on Hour 6, Day 1 was 6.3 for Upneeq versus 2.1 for vehicle (p < 0.0001) and on Hour 2, Day 14 was 7.7 for Upneeq versus 2.4 for vehicle (p < 0.0001). The results also showed a statistically significant improvement in MRD-1 at 5 and 15 minutes, and 2 and 6 hours post dose on days 1 and 14. The Company also completed a 12-week randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo controlled safety study to evaluate the safety of Upneeq compared with vehicle for the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis.

46465,Pfizer and BioNTech Plan for Regulatory Review of its COVID-19 Vaccine in October 2020,PFIZER AND BIONTECH SHARE POSITIVE EARLY DATA ON LEAD MRNA VACCINE CANDIDATE BNT162B2 AGAINST COVID-19,"The companies have shared additional P-I safety and immunogenicity data from their ongoing US study of the BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2, which has advanced into P-II/III evaluation. Across all populations, BNT162b2 was well tolerated with mild to moderate fever in fewer than 20% of the participants
 In P-I study, BNT162b2 (@7days after the second dose of 30μg) elicited SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing GMTs in younger adults (18-55yrs.) that were 3.8 times the GMT of a panel of 38 sera of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients, and in older adults (65-85 years of age), it elicited a neutralizing GMT 1.6 times the GMT of the same panel
 The companies anticipate commencing the global (Ex- China) P-II/III study of BNT162b2 in up to 30,000 participants that started in Jul’2020, which has to date enrolled 11,000+ patients including in areas with significant SARS-CoV-2 transmission","In a Phase 1 study in the U.S., at 7 days after a second dose of 30μg, BNT162b2 elicited SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) in younger adults (18-55 years of age) that were 3.8 times the GMT of a panel of 38 sera of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients, and in older adults (65-85 years of age) the vaccine candidate elicited a neutralizing GMT 1.6 times the GMT of the same panel, demonstrating strong immunogenicity in younger and older adults.
The companies previously announced that BNT162b2-vaccinated human participants displayed a favorable breadth of epitopes recognized in T cell responses specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, and that BNT162b2 demonstrated concurrent induction of high magnitude CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and against the remainder of the spike glycoprotein
Across all populations, BNT162b2 administration was well tolerated with mild to moderate fever in fewer than 20% of the participants
These results informed the selection of the BNT162b2 candidate for the pivotal Phase 2/3 global study in up to 30,000 participants that started in July 2020, which has to date enrolled more than 11,000 participants, including in areas with significant SARS-CoV-2 transmission
Assuming clinical success, Pfizer and BioNTech are on track to seek regulatory review of BNT162b2 as early as October 2020 and, if regulatory authorization or approval is obtained, currently plan to supply up to 100 million doses worldwide by the end of 2020 and approximately 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021
NEW YORK & MAINZ, Germany–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today shared additional Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity data from their ongoing U.S. study of the BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine program against SARS-CoV-2, which has advanced into Phase 2/3 evaluation. The newly released manuscript describes key safety and immunogenicity data from the U.S. Phase 1 trial for the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate, which at30μg recorded 7 days after the second dose elicited SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) in younger adults (18-55 years of age) that were 3.8 times the GMT of a panel of 38 sera of SARS-CoV2 convalescent patients, and in older adults (65-85 years of age) the vaccine candidate elicited a neutralizing GMT 1.6 times the GMT of the same panel, demonstrating strong immunogenicity in younger and older adults. Further, across all populations, BNT162b2 administration was well tolerated with mild to moderate fever in fewer than 20% of the participants. As previously announced, these data informed the companies’ decision to advance a 2-dose regimen of the 30µg dose level of BNT162b2, which encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein (S), into a Phase 2/3 evaluation. The manuscript is now available on an online preprint server at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176651v1 and is concurrently undergoing scientific peer review for potential publication.

The companies are continuing to analyze data from the Phase 1 trials in the U.S. and Germany. T cell immune responses elicited by BNT162b2 are being evaluated in the German study and the companies expect to submit the data for peer review and potential publication. The companies previously announced that BNT162b2-vaccinated human participants displayed a favorable breadth of epitopes recognized in T cell responses specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, as compared to the BNT162b1 candidate, and that BNT162b2 demonstrated concurrent induction of high magnitude CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and against the remainder of the spike glycoprotein that is not contained in the BNT162b1 vaccine candidate.

“The totality of the clinical and preclinical data informed Pfizer and BioNTech’s decision to select BNT162b2 as the lead candidate to advance into pivotal trials. We are proud to share our findings with the scientific community as we continue our work to deliver a safe and effective vaccine to combat this devastating virus,” said Kathrin U. Jansen, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development, Pfizer. “We are especially pleased to offer these early data showing our vaccine candidate’s promising safety and immunogenicity profile from the U.S. trial and we look forward to sharing T cell immune response data from the German trial in the near future.”

“It is important to us to continue sharing data and related information on our COVID-19 vaccine lead candidate,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-Founder of BioNTech. “The favorable safety profile of BNT162b2 and the breadth of T cell responses we previously announced have supported our decision to select this candidate for the pivotal Phase 2/3 study. As of today, we have already dosed more than 11,000 participants with BNT162b2 in that study.”

The additional data from the ongoing U.S. Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study was utilized to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of varying dose levels of BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 in 195 participants randomized into 13 groups of 15 participants (per group, 12 received the vaccine and 3 the placebo). Groups of participants 18 to 55 years of age and 65 to 85 years of age received 10μg, 20μg, or 30μg dose levels of BNT162b1 or BNT162b2 on a 2-dose schedule, 21 days apart.

In both younger and older adults, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing antibody GMTs, which were substantially elevated after the second dose, showing clear benefit of a 2-dose regimen. Although both vaccine candidates elicited lower antigen-binding IgG (Immunoglobulin G) and neutralizing responses in older adults (65 to 85 years of age), compared to younger adults (18 to 55 years of age), the neutralizing antibody GMTs measured 7 days after Dose 2 of 30μg of BNT162b1 or BNT162b2 in participants 65 to 85 years old were comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera from 38 patients (18 to 83 years of age) who had contracted SARS-CoV-2.

Participants 18 to 55 years old who received 10μg, 20μg, or 30μg of BNT162b1 reported mild to moderate local reactions, primarily pain at the injection site, within 7 days after an injection which were more frequent after Dose 2. In participants 65 to 85 years old, BNT162b1 elicited similar, but milder, local reactions, with mild to moderate injection site pain reported by 92% after Dose 1 and 75% after Dose 2. A similar pattern was observed after vaccination with BNT162b2. No older adult who received BNT162b2 reported redness or swelling. No participant who received either vaccine candidate reported a Grade 4 local reaction.

Systemic events after administration of BNT162b2 were milder than those with BNT162b1. Overall, after Dose 1, systemic events reported by participants 65 to 85 years old who received BNT162b2 were similar to those reported by those who received placebo. After Dose 2 of 30μg BNT162b2, only 17% of participants 18 to 55 years old and 8% of participants 65 to 85 years old reported fever (≥38.0 to 38.9 °C), compared to 75% of 18 to 55 year old participants and 33% of 65 to 85 year old participants administered a second dose of 30μg of BNT162b1. Severe systemic events (fatigue, headache, chills, muscle pain, and joint pain) were reported in small numbers of younger BNT162b2 recipients and were transient and manageable. No severe systemic events were reported by older BNT162b2 recipients. There were no reports of Grade 4 systemic events by any BNT162 recipient.

The totality of data contributed to the decision by Pfizer and BioNTech to commence the global (except for China) Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy portion of the clinical study to evaluate BNT162b2 against COVID-19. The study is now actively enrolling in the U.S., Argentina and Brazil. Additional enrollment is planned in Germany, Turkey and South Africa. The study is an event-driven trial that is planned to enroll up to 30,000 participants between 18 and 85 years of age. The Phase 2/3 trial enrollment to date has exceeded 11,000 participants with a second dose underway.

Pfizer and BioNTech are committed to decreasing health disparities in underrepresented populations through the clinical trial process. To that end, many investigator sites are in diverse communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 so that individuals who have been most impacted have the opportunity to participate. The companies are also working together with investigator sites and advocacy partners to raise awareness about the importance of participation in this trial.

BNT162b2 remains under clinical study and is not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world.

Imfinzi approved in Japan for the treatment of
extensive-stage small cell lung cancer

Only PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy to demonstrate both a significant survival benefit and improved response rate in combination with a choice of chemotherapies

AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) has been approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), in combination with etoposide plus a choice of platinum chemotherapy (either carboplatin or cisplatin). SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly, despite initial response to chemotherapy.1,2

The approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare was based on positive results from the Phase III CASPIAN trial, showing Imfinzi plus chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy alone. These results were published in The Lancet in 2019.3

Makoto Nishio MD, PhD, Director, Thoracic Medical Oncology, The Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan and an investigator in the Phase III CASPIAN trial, said: “Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in Japan are in urgent need of new options that can provide long-term tumour control and sustained improvements in overall survival. This approval of Imfinzi provides Japanese patients with a new, effective and well-tolerated 1st-line treatment option for this disease, and for the first time physicians have the opportunity to combine immunotherapy with cisplatin for these patients.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “This approval of Imfinzi provides an important new immunotherapy option in Japan for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. These patients have an especially poor prognosis, with only two per cent surviving beyond five years. Imfinzi, in combination with chemotherapy, delivers a sustained survival benefit and prolonged treatment response with a convenient dosing regimen given every four weeks during maintenance.”

The CASPIAN trial met the primary endpoint of OS for Imfinzi plus chemotherapy in June 2019, reducing the risk of death by 27% versus chemotherapy alone (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.91; p=0.0047), with median OS of 13.0 months versus 10.3 months for chemotherapy alone. Results also showed an increased confirmed objective response rate for Imfinzi plus chemotherapy (68% versus 58% for chemotherapy alone) and that Imfinzi added to chemotherapy delayed the time for disease symptoms to worsen.

An updated analysis recently showed sustained efficacy for Imfinzi plus chemotherapy after a median follow up of more than two years (OS HR: 0.75; 95% CI 0.62-0.91; nominal p=0.0032), with median OS of 12.9 months versus 10.5 months for chemotherapy alone. The safety and tolerability for Imfinzi plus chemotherapy were consistent with the known safety profile of these medicines. No patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies to Imfinzi.

The efficacy and safety results for Japanese patients in the CASPIAN trial were consistent with the overall trial population in a prespecified analysis. The CASPIAN trial used a fixed dose of Imfinzi (1,500mg), administered every three weeks for four cycles while in combination with chemotherapy and then every four weeks until disease progression.

Imfinzi, in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin, is also approved in the US and several other countries around the world for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the 1st-line setting and is currently under regulatory review in other countries. It was recently recommended for marketing authorisation in the EU for this indication.

As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested following concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with limited-stage SCLC in the Phase III ADRIATIC trial.

Small cell lung cancer
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one fifth of all cancer deaths.4 In Japan, nearly 119,000 people were diagnosed with lung cancer in 2018 and there were nearly 82,000 deaths from the disease.5 Lung cancer is broadly split into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC, with about 15% classified as SCLC.6 About two thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with ES-SCLC, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.7 Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.7

CASPIAN

CASPIAN was a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, global Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of 805 patients with ES-SCLC. The trial compared Imfinzi in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy, or Imfinzi and chemotherapy with the addition of a second immunotherapy, tremelimumab, versus chemotherapy alone. In the experimental arms, patients were treated with four cycles of chemotherapy. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation. The trial was conducted in more than 200 centres across 23 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint was OS in each of the two experimental arms. In June 2019, AstraZeneca announced the CASPIAN trial had met one primary endpoint of demonstrating OS for Imfinzi plus chemotherapy at a planned interim analysis. In March 2020, it was announced that the second experimental arm with tremelimumab did not meet its primary endpoint of OS.

Imfinzi
Imfinzi is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

Imfinzi is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on results from    the Phase III PACIFIC trial. Imfinzi is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and a small number of other countries.

As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combinations including with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and other solid tumours.

AstraZeneca in lung cancer
AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. AstraZeneca aims to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFR-mutated tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with the approved medicines Iressa (gefitinib) and Tagrisso (osimertinib) and its ongoing Phase III trials LAURA, NeoADAURA and FLAURA2.8-10

AstraZeneca is committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing Phase II trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD, which are testing Tagrisso in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines. Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate, is in development for the treatment of metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC, including trials in combination with other anticancer treatments. In addition, DS-1062, a trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed ADC, is in early development for the treatment of advanced NSCLC where TROP2 is overexpressed in the majority of tumours.11
An extensive Immuno-Oncology (IO) development programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation, which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.12 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease, including potentially-curative settings (Phase III trials MERMAID-1, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. Imfinzi is also in development in the Phase II trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline, including Enhertu.

AstraZeneca’s approach to IO

IO is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes Imfinzi as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

AstraZeneca in oncology
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

Approximately 25 million such procedures take place annually in the US, of which ~90% use moderate sedation
BYFAVO is the second Acacia Pharma product approved by the FDA in 2020 and extends its portfolio of new products for anesthesia
Conference call scheduled for 9:00 am ET / 3:00 pm CET, Monday 6 July
This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014.

Cambridge, UK and Indianapolis, US – 2 July 2020: Acacia Pharma Group plc (“Acacia Pharma” or the “Company”) (EURONEXT: ACPH), a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel products to improve the care of patients undergoing serious medical treatments such as surgery, invasive procedures, or chemotherapy, announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BYFAVO™ (remimazolam) for injection for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less.

Acacia Pharma in-licensed the commercial rights to BYFAVO for the US from Cosmo Pharmaceuticals NV in January 2020. Remimazolam was developed by Paion AG.

The approval of BYFAVO will help to further strengthen Acacia Pharma’s financial resources, as previously announced, the Company will now have access to an additional €25 million debt facility from Cosmo. Acacia Pharma will make a €30 million upfront payment for the license of BYFAVO to Cosmo, triggered by the approval, consisting of €15 million in cash and €15 million in ordinary shares of Acacia Pharma stock. The €10 million of net cash that Acacia Pharma will receive will be available to help fund the US launch of BYFAVO.

“We are very pleased to announce today the approval of BYFAVO in the US for procedural sedation in adult patients,” commented Mike Bolinder, Acacia Pharma’s CEO. “This marks the second FDA approval of an Acacia Pharma product since the start of 2020 and another major milestone in our evolution into an integrated hospital pharmaceutical company with strong development and commercialization capabilities. The addition of BYFAVO to our product portfolio strengthens our offering to anesthesiologists and enables us to further leverage our commercial infrastructure. I would like to thank our partners at Paion and Cosmo as well as the Acacia Pharma team and our stakeholders who have enabled us to bring this new and innovative therapeutic to market to address the needs of millions of patients each year undergoing procedures that require sedation.”

Gerard A. Silvestri, MD, MS, Professor of Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, and past-president of the American College of Chest Physicians, commented: “The approval of remimazolam (BYFAVO) is very exciting for proceduralists as the field has not seen new sedation medications added to our armamentarium in decades. The drug performed very well in clinical trials, with excellent sedation effect enabling 80-90% of procedures to be completed successfully. The cardio-respiratory safety profile looked very encouraging and there was a rapid return of patients to consciousness enabling them to be discharged in a timely manner.”

“It is gratifying to see how successfully our new strategy is unfolding. We entered into new partnerships with RedHill Biopharma and Acacia before their own main products were approved by taking substantial equity stakes in these companies and integrating our products, Aemcolo® and BYFAVO, into each so that they could potentially have a more stable and efficient marketing organization. The approval of BYFAVO follows the approval of RedHill’s Talicia and Acacia’s BARHEMSYS® and is the third FDA approval in 9 months for products in companies in which we hold an equity stake. We are now looking forward to Acacia Pharma’s transforming BYFAVO into a resounding success,” said Alessandro Della Chà, CEO of Cosmo Pharmaceuticals.

Dr. Jim Phillips, CEO of PAION AG, commented: “The US marketing approval of BYFAVO marks the most significant milestone in PAION’s history, and I congratulate everyone who has played a role in this important achievement. The US is the world’s largest pharmaceutical market, and we are excited to see the product PAION successfully developed being made available to doctors there. We wish Acacia a highly successful market launch in this important market, and we will be supporting their commercialization efforts. We also look forward to remimazolam being rolled out in other countries around the globe as we and our partners work to gain additional marketing approvals.”

“BYFAVO is an important addition to the limited selection of drugs available for procedural sedation,” said Acacia Pharma’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Gabriel Fox. “BYFAVO demonstrated clear patient benefits in its extensive clinical trial program, offering very rapid onset and offset of action coupled with an incidence of cardio-respiratory and other adverse reactions similar to that seen in patients in the placebo group. We are grateful to all the clinical investigators and patients who made this approval possible through their participation in the development program.”

The safety of BYFAVO was evaluated in three pivotal studies in 969 patients undergoing colonoscopy (two studies) or bronchoscopy (one study), of whom 630 received BYFAVO. In these studies, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) following BYFAVO administration were hypotension, hypertension, diastolic hypertension, systolic hypertension, hypoxia, and diastolic hypotension. The labeling for BYFAVO includes a Boxed Warning regarding appropriate training of personnel and equipment that must be available when administering BYFAVO, during sedation and during the recovery period of the procedure. The Boxed Warning also addresses risks from concomitant use of BYFAVO with opioid analgesics and other sedative hypnotics. See Important Safety Information at the end of this press release and Prescribing Information.

Acacia Pharma’s first product, BARHEMSYS® (amisulpride injection) was approved by the FDA on 26 February 2020 for the treatment and prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in adult patients and the company intends to launch both BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO in the US during the second half of 2020.

It should be noted that BYFAVO may not be marketed in the US until the Drug Enforcement Administration has determined its scheduling under the Controlled Substances Act, which is expected to take place within the next few months.

Important Safety Information for BYFAVOTM (remimazolam) Injection

Indications
BYFAVO is a benzodiazepine indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less.

Important Safety Information

WARNING: PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT FOR MONITORING AND RESUSCITATION AND RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOID ANALGESICS
Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and Resuscitation
Only personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation, and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, should administer BYFAVO.
Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and apnea, including the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation.
BYFAVO has been associated with hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and during the recovery period.
Resuscitative drugs, and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag-valve-mask–assisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO.
Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-Hypnotics
Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including BYFAVO, and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. The sedative effect of intravenous BYFAVO can be accentuated by concomitantly administered CNS depressant medications, including other benzodiazepines and propofol. Continuously monitor patients for respiratory depression and depth of sedation.

Contraindication                                                                 
BYFAVO is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dextran 40 or products containing dextran 40.

Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and Resuscitation
Clinically notable hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension were observed in Phase 3 studies of BYFAVO. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and through the recovery period. Only personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation, and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, should administer BYFAVO. Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and apnea, including the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation. Resuscitative drugs, and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag-valve-mask–assisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO. Consider the potential for worsened cardiorespiratory depression prior to using BYFAVO concomitantly with other drugs that have the same potential (e.g., opioid analgesics or other sedative-hypnotics). Administer supplemental oxygen to sedated patients through the recovery period. A benzodiazepine reversal agent (flumazenil) should be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO.

Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-Hypnotics      Concomitant use of BYFAVO and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. The sedative effect of IV BYFAVO can be accentuated when administered with other CNS depressant medications (eg, other benzodiazepines and propofol). Titrate the dose of BYFAVO when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative-hypnotics to the desired clinical response. Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension, airway obstruction, hypoventilation, apnea, and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the elderly, and ASA-PS class III or IV patients.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

BYFAVO contains dextran 40, which can cause hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria, pruritus, and anaphylaxis. BYFAVO is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dextran 40 or products containing dextran 40.

Neonatal Sedation

Use of benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) in the neonate. Observe newborns for signs of sedation and manage accordingly.

Pediatric Neurotoxicity

Published animal studies demonstrate that anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of this is not clear. However, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.
Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions reported in >10% of patients (N=630) receiving BYFAVO 5-30 mg (total dose) and undergoing colonoscopy (two studies) or bronchoscopy (one study) were: hypotension, hypertension, diastolic hypertension, systolic hypertension, hypoxia, and diastolic hypotension.

Use in Specific Populations
Pregnancy

There are no data on the specific effects of BYFAVO on pregnancy. Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to benzodiazepines during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression.

Lactation
Monitor infants exposed to BYFAVO through breast milk for sedation, respiratory depression, and feeding problems. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 5 hours after BYFAVO administration.

Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. BYFAVO should not be used in patients less than 18 years of age.

Geriatric Use
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. However, there is a potential for greater sensitivity (eg, faster onset, oversedation, confusion) in some older individuals. Administer supplemental doses of BYFAVO slowly to achieve the level of sedation required and monitor all patients closely for cardiorespiratory complications.

Hepatic Impairment
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the dose of BYFAVO should be carefully titrated to effect. Depending on the overall status of the patient, lower frequency of supplemental doses may be needed to achieve the level of sedation required for the procedure. All patients should be monitored for sedation-related cardiorespiratory complications.

Abuse and Dependence
BYFAVO has the potential for abuse and physical dependence.

46555,The US FDA Approves Kyprolis (carfilzomib) + Darzalex (daratumumab) + Dexamethasone in Two Dosing Regimens for R/R Multiple Myeloma,U.S. FDA Approves New DARZALEX (daratumumab)-Based Combination Regimen for Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma,"The US FDA has approved Janssen’s Darzalex + Amgen’s Kyprolis (carfilzomib) and dexamethasone (DKd) in two dosing regimen (70 mg/m2 , qw and 56 mg/m2 , q2w) for the treatment of adult patients with r/r MM who have received 1-3L therapies
 The approval of q2w dosing regimen is based on P-III CANDOR study assessing DKd (q2w) vs Kd in 466 patients with r/r MM and has met its 1EPs of PFS after a median follow-up of 16.9 & 16.3 mos. respectively
 The inclusion of carfilzomib (qw) as an approved DKd regimen is based P-Ib EQUULEUS study assessing Darzalex in combination with multiple treatment regimens. Carfilzomib (qw) was evaluated with a starting dose of 20 mg/m2, which was increased to 70 mg/m2 on Cycle 1, Day 8 and onward","HORSHAM, Pa., Aug. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) in combination with Kyprolis® (carfilzomib) and dexamethasone (DKd) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three previous lines of therapy. DARZALEX® has been approved in combination with two carfilzomib dosing regimens, 70 mg/m2 once weekly and 56 mg/m2 twice weekly, based on positive results from the Phase 3 CANDOR and Phase 1b EQUULEUS studies, representing the first-ever approval of an anti-CD38 with carfilzomib.

“The significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) seen among patients receiving the DKd regimen supports the use of this new combination for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. We continue to advance effective regimens for the most critical patients who have already relapsed,” said Saad Z. Usmani, M.D., Division Chief of Plasma Cell Disorders, Atrium Health’s Levine Cancer Institute, and principal investigator of the CANDOR study. “The DKd regimen fills an important gap in the treatment landscape, as many patients may relapse following an immunomodulatory drug-based therapy, such as lenalidomide-containing regimens, and therefore new therapeutic options are needed.”

Click to tweet: U.S. #FDA approved new combination regimen for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple #myeloma. See here for more details: bit.ly/2C8dc32  

The CANDOR study is the first Phase 3 randomized trial to compare DKd versus carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The study, which administered carfilzomib twice weekly, met its primary endpoint of PFS after a median follow-up of 16.9 months and 16.3 months for the DKd and Kd arms, respectively.1 The median PFS had not been reached in the DKd arm and was 15.8 months in the Kd arm (Hazard Ratio=0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.46- 0.85; P=0.0014), representing a 37 percent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for patients treated with DKd versus Kd.1 The inclusion of once-weekly dosing of carfilzomib as an approved DKd regimen was supported by positive results from the open-label, multi-cohort Phase 1b EQUULEUS trial, which evaluated DARZALEX® in combination with various treatment regimens.2

“With this most recent approval of the DKd regimen, patients with multiple myeloma now have the option to receive treatment with DARZALEX and carfilzomib as early as their first relapse, which is a critical time in their treatment journey,” said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “With our deep disease focus and commitment to develop regimens which can help improve patient outcomes for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, the CANDOR study further establishes another DARZALEX-containing regimen (DKd) which may provide benefit for this patient population.”

In CANDOR, the safety profile of DKd was generally consistent with the known safety profiles of DARZALEX® and Kd, and reflect a median treatment duration of 16.1 months for the DKd arm and 9.3 months for the Kd arm.1 Serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in 56 percent and 46 percent of patients who received DKd and Kd, respectively.1 The most frequent serious AE in the DKd arm, compared with the Kd arm, was pneumonia (14 percent vs 9 percent). Fatal AEs occurred in 10 percent of DKd patients and 5 percent of Kd patients, and the most frequent fatal AE was infection (5 percent vs 3 percent).

About the CANDOR Study1
CANDOR is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 study of DARZALEX®, carfilzomib and dexamethasone (DKd) compared to carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) alone. The study evaluated 466 relapsed or refractory patients with multiple myeloma who had received one to three prior lines of therapy from 102 global sites. Patients were treated until disease progression. The primary endpoint was PFS, and the key secondary endpoints were overall response rate, minimal residual disease and overall survival. PFS was defined as time from randomization until disease progression or death from any cause.

All patients received carfilzomib as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each 28-day cycle (20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 during cycle 1 and 56 mg/m2 thereafter) and received 40 mg dexamethasone oral or IV weekly (20 mg/m2 for patients aged >75 years). In the treatment arm, DARZALEX® 8 mg/kg was administered IV on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 and 16 mg/kg IV once weekly for the remaining doses of the first two cycles, then every two weeks for four cycles (cycles 3 to 6), and every four weeks thereafter. Of the patients randomized in the study, 92 percent had received a prior proteasome inhibitor, 42 percent had received prior lenalidomide, and 33 percent were lenalidomide-refractory.1

CANDOR is an Amgen-sponsored study and is co-funded by Janssen Research & Development, LLC. For more information about this trial, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov under trial identification number NCT03158688.

About the EQUULEUS Study2
EQUULEUS is an open-label, Phase 1b, multi-cohort trial which evaluated the safety, tolerability and dosing regimen of DARZALEX®, when administered in combination with various treatment regimens for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Among the regimens evaluated, the combination of DARZALEX®, carfilzomib and dexamethasone (DKd) was studied in 85 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least one to three prior lines of therapy. Carfilzomib was evaluated using a once-weekly dosing regimen, with a starting dose of 20 mg/m2, which was increased to 70 mg/m2 on Cycle 1, Day 8 and onward.

About DARZALEX® 
Janssen is committed to exploring the potential of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) across the spectrum of the disease. DARZALEX® has been approved in eight indications, three of which are in the frontline setting, including newly diagnosed patients with MM who are transplant eligible and ineligible.

In August 2012, Janssen entered into an exclusive global license and development agreement with Genmab A/S to develop, manufacture, and commercialize DARZALEX®.3  DARZALEX® has become a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma, having been used in the treatment of more than 143,000 patients worldwide and more than 68,000 patients in the U.S. alone since its U.S. FDA approval in 2015. DARZALEX® is the first CD38-directed antibody approved globally to treat MM.

CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease.4 DARZALEX® binds to CD38 and inhibits tumor cell growth causing myeloma cell death.5 DARZALEX® may also have an effect on normal cells.5 Data across seven Phase 3 clinical trials, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that DARZALEX®-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12

About Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.13,14 When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow. In 2020, it is estimated that more than 32,000 people will be diagnosed and close to 13,000 will die from the disease in the U.S.15 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms, which can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood cell counts, tiredness, high calcium levels, kidney problems or infections.15

DARZALEX® IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

CONTRAINDICATIONS

DARZALEX® is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactic reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Infusion-Related Reactions

DARZALEX® can cause severe and/or serious infusion-related reactions including anaphylactic reactions. In clinical trials (monotherapy and combination: N=2066), infusion-related reactions occurred in 37% of patients with the Week 1 (16 mg/kg) infusion, 2% with the Week 2 infusion, and cumulatively 6% with subsequent infusions. Less than 1% of patients had a Grade 3/4 infusion-related reaction at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. The median time to onset was 1.5 hours (range: 0 to 73 hours). Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4 hours of completing DARZALEX®. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, laryngeal edema, and pulmonary edema. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting, and nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, and hypotension.

When DARZALEX® dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT (CASSIOPEIA) for a median of 3.75 months (range: 2.4 to 6.9 months), upon re-initiation of DARZALEX®, the incidence of infusion-related reactions was 11% for the first infusion following ASCT. Infusion-related reactions occurring at re-initiation of DARZALEX® following ASCT were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity (Grade 3 or 4: <1%) with those reported in previous studies at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. In EQUULEUS, patients receiving combination treatment (n=97) were administered the first 16 mg/kg dose at Week 1 split over two days, ie, 8 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 2, respectively. The incidence of any grade infusion-related reactions was 42%, with 36% of patients experiencing infusion-related reactions on Day 1 of Week 1, 4% on Day 2 of Week 1, and 8% with subsequent infusions.

Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion. Interrupt DARZALEX® infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue DARZALEX® therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion.

To reduce the risk of delayed infusion-related reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX® infusions. Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Interference With Serological Testing

Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum. The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type is not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX®. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX®.

Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia

DARZALEX® may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer’s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX® until recovery of neutrophils or for recovery of platelets.

Interference With Determination of Complete Response

Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX® may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX® and for 3 months after the last dose.

The combination of DARZALEX® with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) were: upper respiratory infection, neutropenia, infusion-related reactions, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, constipation, anemia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, peripheral edema, nausea, cough, pyrexia, dyspnea, and asthenia. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities (≥40%) with DARZALEX® are: neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia.

 Senaparib is a PARP inhibitor, currently being evaluated in multiple P-I & II studies in multiple settings. The drug has been tested in 100+ patients with advanced solid tumors in multiple clinical trials in China and Australia","SHANGHAI and NANJING, China, Aug. 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Junshi Biosciences (HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180), a leading innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies, and Impact Therapeutics, a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company devoted to the discovery and development of targeted anti-cancer therapeutics based on synthetic lethality, annouced today that they reached a strategic agreement to establish a joint venture focusing on the research and development and commercialization of PARP inhibitor, a small moleule anti-tumor agent.

Under the agreement, Junshi Biosciences will contribute at most RMB 300 million in cash, representing 50% of the registered capital of the JV company. Impact Therapeutics will contribute by way of injection of the IMP4297 asset in the collaboration territory (Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macao), representing the other 50%. Both parties will work closely together to develop IMP4297 in the collaboration territory including conducting the clinical studies of multiple indications, manufacturing and commercialization preparation.

“Impact Therapeutics is a leader among domestic targeted anti-tumor drug discovery companies. We are excited to have the opportunity to partner with Impact to bring domestic innovation to benefit patients in China and beyond. Data showed that Senaparib (IMP427) has superior safety and has the potential to be the best-in-class, which means that IMP427 has great potential as a monotherapy as well as in combination with other agents,” said Ning Li, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Junshi Biosciences.

Dr. Jun Bao, CEO of Impact Therapeutics, stated that, “Junshi Biosciences is an emerging innovative pharmaceutical company who has achieved a great deal in anti-cancer therapeutics. We are delighted to establish the collaboration partnership with Junshi. We believe both Impact and Junshi will take advantages of each team’s strength to expedite the clinical development of IMP4297 and explore additional indications to bring more benefit to the patients.”

About Senaparib (IMP4297)
Senaparib (IMP4297) is a novel agent targeting PARP (poly-ADP ribose polymerase) developed by Impact. The company is finishing two Phase I studies of senaparib in China and Australia, respectively. The preliminary Phase I data was first presented in ASCO 2019. The updated results of two Ph1 studies will be presented at upcoming world-class clinical conference. So far, over 100 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with senaparib. Initial clinical results showed that comparing to other PARP inhibitors currently on the market and in clinical trials, senaparib has a wider therapeutic window and a better safety profile. This potentially makes senaparib more suitable for patients taking the drug chronically such as in maintenance therapy. It could also make combination therapies with other anti-cancer agents more tolerable for patients. Therefore, senaparib has the potential to be the best-in-class PARP inhibitor. In China, Impact is conducting a phase II pivotal study of senaparib monotherapy in treating advanced ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutation who have received at least 2 prior lines of standard treatment (Study SABRINA）and a Phase III study of senaparib as the first-line maintenance treatment in platinum-sensitive advanced ovarian cancer patients (Study FLAMES). Outside China, the Company is also conducting a Ph1/2 study of senaprib in combination with temozolomide in treating advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients who have received at least 1 line of standard treatment.

46591,BioMarin Reports NDA Submission to the US FDA for Vosoritide to Treat Children with Achondroplasia,BioMarin Submits New Drug Application to U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Vosoritide to Treat Children with Achondroplasia,"BioMarin has submitted an NDA to the US FDA for vosoritide to treat children with achondroplasia
 The company also reported that EMA has begun validation of MAA for the therapy on 13 Aug, 2020
 Vosoritide is an investigational, once-daily injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) and is potentially the first treatment for achondroplasia in the US","SAN RAFAEL, Calif., Aug. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) today announced that it has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for vosoritide, an investigational, once daily injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) for children with achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans.  BioMarin recently announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated the Company’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for vosoritide on Aug. 13, 2020.

“We are grateful to the children and families who have participated in the clinical studies to evaluate the potentially first pharmacological treatment option for children with achondroplasia.  We are proud of our team and clinical partners, who have conducted extensive scientific and clinical research to address the underlying cause of the condition,” said Hank Fuchs, M.D., President, Global Research and Development at BioMarin. “This is an important step to bring a treatment where none have existed before.  We also recognize a broad range of views about treatment options, and we look forward to providing children with achondroplasia and their families a treatment choice with this potential new therapy.”

“This regulatory submission is an important scientific and medical milestone for children with achondroplasia and their families,” said Julie Hoover-Fong, MD, PhD, FACMG, Professor, McKusick-Nathans Department of Genetic Medicine and Director, Greenberg Center for Skeletal Dysplasias at Johns Hopkins University and an investigator in the vosoritide clinical program.  “The extensive clinical program for vosoritide includes important natural history information, which has contributed to the body of scientific knowledge about achondroplasia and a potential treatment option for patients.”

“This regulatory submission brings our community closer to accessing the first therapeutic choice for children and families,” said Chandler Crews, Founder of The Chandler Project.  “A well-researched drug treatment choice has the potential to be an important resource for the community and to increase our understanding of the scientific underpinnings of achondroplasia.”

The Chandler Project is dedicated to the most common form of dwarfism and other congenital abnormalities and is a means for patients and parents of children with achondroplasia to find the correct resources for themselves and their child.

About Achondroplasia

Achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans, is characterized by slowing of endochondral ossification, which results in disproportionate short stature and disordered architecture in the long bones, spine, face and base of the skull. This condition is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), a negative regulator of bone growth. Beyond disproportionate short stature, people with achondroplasia can experience serious health complications, including foramen magnum compression, sleep apnea, bowed legs, mid-face hypoplasia, permanent sway of the lower back, spinal stenosis and recurrent ear infections. Some of these complications can result in the need for invasive surgeries such as spinal cord decompression and straightening of bowed legs. In addition, studies show increased mortality at every age.

More than 80% of children with achondroplasia have parents of average stature and have the condition as the result of a spontaneous gene mutation.  The worldwide incidence rate of achondroplasia is about one in 25,000 live births.  Vosoritide is being tested in children whose growth plates are still “open”, typically those under 18 years of age. This is approximately 25% of people with achondroplasia.  In the U.S., Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and most of Asia Pacific, there are currently no licensed medicines for achondroplasia.

NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Renalytix AI plc (LSE: RENX) (NASDAQ: RNLX),  today announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) to develop and launch precision medicine strategies for cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases. The first stage in the collaboration will use KidneyIntelX, an artificial intelligence-enabled in vitro diagnostic platform, to examine further improving outcomes for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications, in coordination with the Mount Sinai Health System. The goal of the first stage is to help improve guideline-based standard-of-care for optimal utilization of existing and novel therapeutics using the KidneyIntelX testing platform and proprietary care management software.

An estimated 700 million patients worldwide have CKD,1 which is also associated with an increased risk of metabolic and hematologic complications, such as hyperkalemia (elevated levels of potassium in the blood) and anemia.2,3

The first stage will assess the impact of AI-enabled in vitro diagnostic solutions to optimize utilization of therapeutics in CKD under current standard of care protocols. Based on study outcomes, a multi-center, randomized controlled trial will be initiated to evaluate uptake and adherence to new potassium-binding agents in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. The studies will be conducted in coordination with the Mount Sinai Health System, where KidneyIntelX testing and care management software are currently being deployed for commercial clinical use.

“We believe this collaboration will define how we can leverage KidneyIntelX to improve the care and outcomes for patients affected by chronic diseases, such as kidney disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease,” said Barbara Murphy, MD, Chair of the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine, Dean for Clinical Integration and Population Health Management at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and board member of RenalytixAI. “By using a more personalized approach, our initial goal is to help realize improved outcomes for more than 240,000 patients with chronic kidney disease within the Mount Sinai Health System.”

RenalytixAI and AstraZeneca will use KidneyIntelX with the aim to:

Help improve physician uptake and patient adherence to existing potassium-binding therapeutics and other approved products in CKD through early identification of previously hidden high-risk patient groups
Accelerate patient identification and recruitment for clinical trials
Complement commercialization efforts with outcomes from KidneyIntelX results
“This collaborative approach reflects the shared vision of AstraZeneca and RenalytixAI to develop meaningful solutions to tackle significant challenges in healthcare in a holistic way,” said Tarek Rabah, Vice President, AstraZeneca US Renal-Cardio. “We are committed to revolutionizing kidney care by continuing to drive innovation. An important component of our work is identifying patients with significant unmet need and providing them with more personalized interventions.”

Results from the program are anticipated in early 2021.

About Chronic Kidney Disease 
CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function (shown by reduced eGFR or markers of kidney damage, or both, for at least three months).5 In the United States alone, nearly 37 million American adults (15%) currently have CKD.6 Meanwhile, on a global scale, the total number of individuals with CKD, acute kidney injury (AKI), and those on renal replacement therapy (RRT) exceeds 850 million.7

The disease often has no symptoms in its early stages and can go undetected until it is very advanced requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 9 out of 10 adults with CKD go undiagnosed, and half of patients with very low kidney function, who are not on dialysis, do not know they have CKD.6 For this reason, kidney disease is often referred to as a “silent disease.”8

As kidney function declines, patients face an increased risk of developing other associated CKD complications, such as anemia or hyperkalemia.2,3 Anemia is a serious medical condition in which patients have insufficient red blood cells and low levels of hemoglobin (“Hb”), a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body.3 If left untreated, anemia of CKD can cause increased hospitalization, morbidity and mortality.9 Hyperkalemia can also be a dangerous condition, characterized by elevated potassium levels in the blood.2 If left untreated, it can cause an irregular heartbeat and can be fatal.

About RenalytixAI

August 21, 2020 09:07 AM Eastern Daylight Time
LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq: VRTX) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in a combination regimen with ivacaftor to treat people with cystic fibrosis (CF) ages 12 years and older with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F/MF), or two F508del mutations (F/F) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.

For the first time, up to 10,000 people in Europe ages 12 years and older with CF who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation will be eligible for a CFTR modulator that treats the underlying cause of the disease. Approval of the triple combination regimen also expands the number of treatment options available to people ages 12 years and older with CF who have two copies of the F508del mutation, the most common CF-causing mutation worldwide.

“Today is a significant day for those with CF, their families and Vertex, and one that brings us one step closer towards our ultimate goal of discovering and developing treatments for all patients with CF,” said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President, Vertex. “I would like to thank our dedicated scientists, as well as study investigators and people with CF who participated in our clinical trials to enable this innovative medicine to be approved in Europe today. Without their commitment, this milestone would not have been possible.”

As a result of long-term reimbursement agreements in England, Denmark and the Republic of Ireland, and provisions for access in health care systems such as Germany, eligible patients in these countries will have access to the triple combination regimen in the upcoming weeks. Vertex is committed to working closely with national health authorities and governments in all other countries in Europe to secure access for eligible patients as quickly as possible.

Marketing authorization was based on the results of two global Phase 3 studies, which showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function (primary endpoint) and all key secondary endpoints, in people with CF ages 12 years and older with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation or two F508del mutations in the CFTR gene. The triple combination regimen was generally well tolerated in both studies.

“The triple combination regimen has been shown to have a major impact on several outcome measures in people with CF,” said Professor Harry Heijerman, Professor and Head of the Department of Pulmonology at University Medical Center Utrecht, Netherlands. “The clinical data showed significant improvements in lung function and other important measures, such as sweat chloride levels and quality of life as measured by the CFQ-R respiratory domain score, in patients treated with the triple combination therapy. I now look forward to seeing the impact of the medicine in clinical practice.”

About Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting approximately 75,000 people worldwide. CF is a progressive, multi-system disease that affects the lungs, liver, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands, pancreas and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of all people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. These mutations, which can be determined by a genetic test, or genotyping test, lead to CF by creating non-working and/or too few CFTR proteins at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage in many patients that eventually leads to death. The median age of death is in the early 30s.

About KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in a Combination Regimen With ivacaftor

KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg was developed for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients ages 12 years and older with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F/MF) or two F508del mutations (F/F) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. KAFTRIO® is designed to increase the quantity and function of the F508del-CFTR protein at the cell surface. The EU submission for KAFTRIO® was supported by positive results of two global Phase 3 studies in people ages 12 years and older with CF: a 24-week Phase 3 study in 403 people with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F/MF) and a four-week Phase 3 study in 107 people with two F508del mutations (F/F).

 The results showed the superiority of Kadcyla over Herceptin in terms of the 1EPs of invasive disease-free survival. The safety profile of the therapy in the study was consistent with the previously approved treatment of HER2-positive metastatic BC, and was well-tolerated as an adjuvant treatment in HER2-positive early BC
 Kadcyla is an ADC and a postoperative new treatment option to improve prognosis in the treatment of HER2-positive early BC when pCR is not obtained by neoadjuvant therapy","Kadcyla obtained an additional indication of HER2-positive postoperative early breast cancer, in addition to the indication of HER2-positive inoperable or recurrent breast cancer.
Kadcyla is a postoperative new treatment option to improve prognosis in the treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer when pathologic complete response (pCR) is not obtained by neoadjuvant therapy.
TOKYO, August 21, 2020 — Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 4519) announced today that it has obtained approval for anti-HER2 antibody-tubulin polymerization inhibitor conjugate Kadcyla® Intravenous Infusion 100 mg and 160 mg [generic name: trastuzumab emtansine (genetical recombination)] from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for an additional indication of HER2-positive postoperative breast cancer.

“It is said that the prognosis is poor when pathologic complete response (pCR) is not obtained by neoadjuvant therapy in the treatment of HER-2 positive early breast cancer. In the KATHERINE study, which was evaluated for regulatory approval, Kadcyla reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence or death from any cause by 50% compared to Herceptin. We are very pleased that this approval addresses an unmet medical need for patients seeking a cure, and contributes to the advancement of treatment,” said Dr. Osamu Okuda, Chugai’s President and COO. “As a leading company in the field of oncology, Chugai will strive to promote the appropriate use of this treatment for the benefit of patients.”

This approval is based on the results from an open-label, randomized, global phase III KATHERINE study. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Kadcyla adjuvant therapy in 1,486 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who did not have pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant therapy including Herceptin. The results confirmed the superiority of Kadcyla over Herceptin in terms of the primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival (unstratified hazard ratio: 0.50 [95% confidence interval: 0.39-0.64, log-rank test, p<0.0001]). The safety profile of Kadcyla in this study was consistent with those observed in the previously approved treatement of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, and Kadcyla was also well-tolerated as an adjuvant treatment in HER2-positive early breast cancer.

The transaction expected to be closed by Mar 31, 2021
 The portfolio to be divested includes OTC medicines and health products along with its lead product in the region, Alinamin. Blackstone plans to develop the business together with current TCHC management and continue to employ its employees
 The divestiture allows Takeda to refocus on its five key business areas and reduce debt after its $59 billion acquisition of Shire","– Transaction further sharpens Takeda’s focus on five key business areas
– Consumer Health Care Business to continue serving consumers in Japan and Asia under new owner

Osaka, Japan, August 24, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to divest Takeda Consumer Healthcare Company Limited (“TCHC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda focused on the consumer health care market primarily in Japan, to Oscar A-Co KK, a company controlled by funds managed by The Blackstone Group Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “Blackstone”) for a total value of JPY 242.0 billion*. Blackstone is one of the world leading investment firms and has extensive investment experience in the health care sector. The transaction is expected to close by March 31, 2021, subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions.

The portfolio to be divested to Blackstone includes a variety of over-the-counter (“OTC”) medicines and health products that generated total revenues of over JPY 60 billion in fiscal year 2019. TCHC’s strong regional brands include Alinamin, its top selling product and Japan’s first vitamin B1 preparation, and Benza, a cold remedy. Blackstone intends to develop the business together with current TCHC management and continue to employ its employees.

Christophe Weber, Takeda President and Chief Executive Officer said, “Today’s transaction will provide TCHC with the ownership, resources and strategic focus to continue to thrive and meet the needs of customers, while further sharpening Takeda’s strategic focus and commitment to financial discipline and transforming science into life-changing medicines. TCHC played an important role in Takeda’s long history, but with our growth strategy now focused on five key business areas – Gastroenterology (GI), Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology and Neuroscience – and an increasingly competitive consumer health care market in Japan, the ownership transition will benefit both TCHC and Takeda. We are confident that under Blackstone, TCHC will be well-positioned to continue growing and developing its product offerings in the years to come to address the evolving needs of consumers.”

Takeda, which started TCHC as a separate business in April 2017 to further develop the consumer health care business in Japan, is now focused on highly innovative medicines across its five key business areas and working to address significant unmet patient needs in these fields. Under Blackstone’s ownership, TCHC will benefit from increased strategic focus, resources and agility to support the growth and development of its important brands and to rapidly respond to evolving market conditions and diverse customer needs.

The sale of TCHC supports Takeda’s divestiture program which is focused on optimization of its portfolio to align with its global long-term growth strategy and provide uninterrupted access and supply of critical products to patients. So far in 2020, Takeda has also agreed to divest three different non-core asset portfolios in the Asia Pacific, Europe, and Latin America regions. In June, Takeda agreed to divest a portfolio of non-core assets sold exclusively in the Asia Pacific region to Celltrion for up to $278 million USD; in April, Takeda announced the sale of non-core products in Europe to Orifarm Group for up to approximately $670 million USD, including the sale of two manufacturing sites in Denmark and Poland; and in March, Takeda announced the sale of non-core products in Latin America to Hypera Pharma for $825 million USD, as well as completed the previously announced sales of non-core assets spanning the Russia-CIS region to STADA and in countries spanning the Near East, Middle East and Africa region to Acino.

Transaction Details of Sale of Shareholding in TCHC to Blackstone

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) today decided to transfer all shares of Takeda Consumer Healthcare Company Limited (“TCHC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda, to Oscar A-Co KK (“SPC”), a company controlled by funds managed by The Blackstone Group Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “Blackstone”), and entered into a share purchase agreement with SPC, as specified below. Following the transfer of shares, TCHC will be excluded from the scope of consolidation of Takeda.

 

Rationale for the share transfer
TCHC has contributed to the health of people through their products. In particular, TCHC’s product Alinamin has established a strong brand based on the trust of customers and has played an important role in Takeda’s history. In order to further develop the consumer health care business mainly in Japan, Takeda had spun off the business into TCHC, who started their business in April 2017. However, the competition in the consumer health care market has increased in recent years, and the needs of customers continues to become more diverse. Under such circumstances, TCHC is required to further strengthen the strategy and increase the responsiveness to the market by building a much more agile business model.

Takeda is currently focusing on five key business areas and also strengthening its commitment to transforming science into life-changing medicines now more than ever. In these situations, carefully considering all options of TCHC’s growth strategies to maximize their capability and expertise, which will lead to further development of their product brands, Takeda has executed a share transfer agreement with SPC. Takeda believes that the swift and flexible decision-making as an independent corporate group under the active and strategic investment capabilities of Blackstone enables TCHC to promptly respond to the market needs, to grow their product brands and to continuously develop themselves. Blackstone intends to develop the business together with current TCHC management and continue to employ its employees.

Future outlook
Takeda anticipates a pre-tax gain of approximately 140.0 billion JPY on the sale of shares of the subsidiary, to be recognized when the transfer of shares is executed and completed. Takeda anticipates Reported Net Profit attributable to owners of the Company to increase by approximately 105.0 billion JPY. Since a gain on the sale of shares of a subsidiary is unusual, non-recurring and unrelated to ongoing operations, there will be no impact on Core Operating Profit or Core Net Profit. With respect to cash flow, Takeda anticipates an approximately 200.0 billion JPY cash (after tax). Takeda will continue to assess the impact and the timing, taking into account progress of its operations and changes in the business environment, if any, and update the FY2020 forecast at the appropriate timing.

Other
The sale of TCHC supports Takeda’s divestiture program which is focused on optimization of its portfolio to align with its global long-term growth strategy and provide uninterrupted access and supply of critical products to patients

– 90 healthy volunteers in two age cohorts (18-55 and 65-85 years) to be enrolled in two clinical sites in Italy

– The Phase 1 trial is being conducted by the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases under the sponsorship of ReiThera

– The Phase 1 trial and the manufacture of clinical material needed for the study is funded by the Italian Ministry of Scientific Research and the Lazio Region (Rome)

– International Phase 2/3 trial in countries with high rates of coronavirus infection planned to start late 2020, pending initial Phase 1 outcome

 

ROME, Aug. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — ReiThera Srl, a biotech company dedicated to the technology development, GMP manufacturing and clinical translation of genetic vaccines and medicinal products for advanced therapies, today announces that the first healthy volunteer has been dosed in a Phase 1 study of the Company’s vaccine candidate (GRAd-COV2) against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The Phase 1 study is being conducted in Italy at the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI) in Rome and at the GB Rossi University Hospital in Verona.

ReiThera’s vaccine candidate GRAd-COV2 encodes the full-length spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The vaccine technology is based on a novel, proprietary replication-defective gorilla adenoviral (GRAd) vector, which both induced a strong humoral and cellular immune response in preclinical studies and demonstrated a good safety profile. GRAd-COV2 is expected to induce strong immune responses based on low pre-existing immunity to the vector in humans.

Vaccines based on similar simian adenoviral vectors, such as Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors (ChAd), have been evaluated in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in other infectious diseases and proved to be safe and immunogenic with a single-dose vaccine.

The Phase 1 clinical trial is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of GRAd-COV2 in 90 healthy volunteers divided equally into two age cohorts: 18-55 years and 65-85 years. Each cohort will be divided into three study arms of 15 volunteers which will be administered one of three escalating doses of GRAd-COV2. Participants will be monitored over a 24-week period.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GRAd-COV2, and to select a vaccine dose for further investigation in a Phase 2/3 trial. The secondary objective is to evaluate the vaccine’s ability to induce immune responses (antibodies and T cells) against the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in volunteers. Interim safety and immunogenicity analysis are expected by mid Q4 2020 which will guide dose selection for Phase 2/3 studies.

A larger international Phase 2/3 trial in countries where SARS-CoV-2 is still very active is planned to commence by the end of 2020, pending positive interim safety and immunogenicity results of the Phase 1 trial.

The Phase 1 trial of GRAd-COV2 is being funded by the Italian Ministry of Scientific Research and the Lazio Region. The study is being run jointly by ReiThera and Lazzaro Spallanzani INMI using initial vaccine material manufactured at ReiThera’s cGMP facility in Rome.

In parallel, ReiThera is working with LEUKOCARE in Germany to develop a thermostable GRAd-COV2 vaccine formulation and with Univercells in Belgium to develop a bespoke manufacturing process to enable rapid, large-scale production of the vaccine.

“This study is the first important step in the clinical development of our novel GRAd-COV2 vaccine against COVID-19,” said ReiThera’s Chief Technology Officer, Stefano Colloca. “We are proud to undertake this trial in Italy where the impact of COVID-19 has been felt particularly hard. The cutting-edge science behind our approach is backed by many years of pioneering research on adenoviral vector technologies with pre-clinical and clinical data generated with a single-dose vaccine in other serious infectious diseases demonstrating potent humoral and cellular immune responses. This feature makes our technology platform suitable for an outbreak situation such as COVID-19 and has clear advantages in terms of manufacturing and compliance.”

“The launch of this Phase 1 trial demonstrates ReiThera’s expertise and what can be done when stakeholders come together towards a common goal,” said ReiThera’s Chief Executive Officer, Antonella Folgori. “We are grateful to Lazzaro Spallanzani INMI for their ongoing collaboration and to the Italian Ministry of Scientific Research and the Lazio Region for funding the trial and initial manufacturing of the GRAd-COV2 vaccine candidate. We look forward to providing important updates about the safety and immunogenicity of our vaccine candidate over the coming months, and potentially advancing into international Phase 2/3 trial later in the year.”

About GRAd-COV2

GRAd-COV2, the candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 recently developed by ReiThera, is based on a novel and proprietary replication-defective simian (gorilla) adenoviral vector (called GRAd) encoding the full-length coronavirus spike protein (GRAd-COV2). The spike protein enables the coronavirus to enter human cells.

Simian adenoviral (SAd) vectors have been extensively used as delivery agents for genetic vaccine candidates against multiple infectious diseases, including Ebola and RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), in different populations, with more than 5,000 individuals including elderly and infants enrolled in early and late stage clinical trials to date. Preclinical and clinical evidence have demonstrated that ReiThera’s vaccine technology is safe and induces robust cellular and humoral immune responses.

ReiThera’s novel GRAd vector belongs to species C adenovirus that are considered the most potent vaccine carriers and has low seroprevalence in humans. This means that GRAd vaccine immunogenicity is not hampered by pre-existing anti-human adenovirus antibodies.

August 24, 2020 06:59 AM Eastern Daylight Time
NEW YORK & MONTREAL–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and Forbius, a privately held, clinical-stage protein engineering company that designs and develops biotherapeutics for the treatment of cancer and fibrotic diseases, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Bristol Myers Squibb will acquire Forbius. Forbius has developed a portfolio of highly selective and potent inhibitors of TGF-beta 1 & 3, which are key mediators of immunosuppression and fibrosis. The transaction includes an upfront payment and future success-based milestone payments. Prior to closing, Forbius’ non-TGF-beta assets will be transferred to a newly formed private company, which will be retained by Forbius’ existing shareholders.

The companies anticipate completing the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2020, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Under this transaction, Bristol Myers Squibb would acquire Forbius’s TGF-beta program, including the program’s lead investigational asset, AVID200. TGF-beta is a key cytokine that regulates various cell processes, including regulation of the immune system. Selective inhibition of TGF-beta 1 & 3 may enhance anti-tumor efficacy by acting synergistically with immunotherapy. Bristol Myers Squibb intends to initially focus research and development efforts of AVID200 in oncology and may consider advancing the asset in other disease areas, such as fibrosis.

“With this acquisition, we extend our leading position in oncology by including new pathways that complement our expansive oncology pipeline with the potential to serve more patients with cancer, including those who may not respond to immunotherapy,” said Rupert Vessey, M.A., B.M., B.Ch., F.R.C.P., D.Phil., Executive Vice President & President, Research & Early Development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “As a science driven company, this transaction shows our continued commitment to source innovation internally and externally to develop new treatments for patients with significant unmet medical needs.”

“Our portfolio of highly selective TGF-beta inhibitors has shown potential across a broad range of therapeutic areas,” said Ilia A. Tikhomirov, President and CEO of Forbius. “We are proud that Bristol Myers Squibb recognizes this potential given their global leadership in oncology and unique position to translate innovative science into meaningful treatments for patients with cancer across the globe.”

Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP served as legal advisors to Bristol Myers Squibb. BofA Securities acted as financial advisor to Forbius and Cooley LLP and Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP served as legal advisors.

About selective inhibition of TGF-beta

TGF-beta isoforms 1 & 3 are believed to be central mediators of tumor microenvironment (TME). Selective inhibition of TGF-beta 1 & 3 is proposed to enhance anti-tumor efficacy by acting synergistically with immunotherapy and has broad potential as an anti-fibrotic therapy across several indications with high unmet need.

About AVID200

AVID200 is a highly potent and isoform-selective TGF-beta inhibitor. AVID200 neutralizes TGF-beta 1 and -beta 3 with picomolar potency. These isoforms are known to be drivers of fibrosis and tumor immune resistance. In contrast, TGF-beta 2 is a positive regulator of hematopoiesis and normal cardiac function, and blockade of TGF-beta 2 is therefore undesirable. The ability of AVID200 to selectively target TGF-beta 1 and -beta 3 positions it to be an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic in fibrotic diseases and immuno-oncology.

46820,Novartis' Triple Regimen Fails to Meet the Primary Endpoint in P-III COMBI-i Study for Advanced Melanoma,Novartis provides update on Phase III study evaluating investigational spartalizumab (PDR001) in combination with Tafinlar + Mekinist in advanced melanoma,"The P-III study involves assessing of spartalizumab (PDR001) + Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and Mekinist (trametinib) vs PBO + Tafinlar and Mekinist in previously untreated patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma
 The study was conducted in three parts while today’s results are from part 3 of the trial. The study did not meet its 1EPS of investigator-assessed progression-free survival
 Spartalizumab is mAb targeting PD-1 receptor while Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines, used in combination to prevent melanoma","Phase III COMBI-i trial did not meet primary endpoint for patients with advanced BRAF V600-mutated melanoma
Tafinlar + Mekinist remains an effective treatment option based on previously reported large, Phase III clinical trials1,2
Spartalizumab development program continues, investigating the immunotherapy in combination with other anti-cancer agents
Basel, August 22, 2020 — Novartis announced today that the Phase III COMBI-i study evaluating the investigational immunotherapy spartalizumab (PDR001), in combination with the targeted therapies Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) and Mekinist® (trametinib), did not meet its primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The trial was conducted among untreated patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600 mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma, compared to Tafinlar + Mekinist alone3.

“While the COMBI-i trial did not reach its primary endpoint, the study’s findings give us valuable insights into the role the investigational immunotherapy spartalizumab may play in future cancer therapy combinations and underscore the previously established importance of Tafinlar + Mekinist for these patients,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “Novartis remains committed to melanoma patients through ongoing research, and we continue to deliver the approved combination therapy Tafinlar + Mekinist to patients around the world. We extend our gratitude to the patients and investigators who participated in the COMBI-i study. Their partnership has expanded our understanding of spartalizumab and its potential role in future cancer treatments.”

Novartis and the COMBI-i study investigators will continue to review the data to learn more from the results, which are expected to be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting. Novartis remains committed to exploring new uses for immunotherapy in cancer treatment, including the ongoing development of spartalizumab, across a range of tumor types.

About the COMBI-i Study3
COMBI-i was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study comparing the combination of anti-PD1 spartalizumab with Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and Mekinist (trametinib) versus the combination of placebo with Tafinlar and Mekinist. The study was conducted among previously untreated patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. The COMBI-i study was conducted in three parts. Results reported today are from part 3 of the trial.

About Spartalizumab (PDR001)
Spartalizumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody directed against the human programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor. Its development program continues investigating the immunotherapy across a range of tumor types.

About Tafinlar + Mekinist Combination
Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to treat people with a type of skin cancer called melanoma:

That has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and
That has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” (V600E or V600K mutation-positive) gene
Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to help prevent melanoma that has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” gene from coming back after the cancer has been removed by surgery.

Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic NSCLC), and that has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF V600E” gene.

Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of thyroid cancer called anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC):

That has spread to other parts of the body and you have no satisfactory treatment options, and
That has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” gene
Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, should not be used to treat people with wild-type BRAF melanoma. Mekinist should not be used to treat people who already have received a BRAF inhibitor for treatment of their melanoma and it did not work or is no longer working.

Your health care provider will perform a test to make sure that Tafinlar and Mekinist , in combination, are right for you.

It is not known if Tafinlar and Mekinist are safe and effective in children.

Tafinlar and Mekinist, in combination, may cause serious side effects such as the risk of new cancers, including both skin cancer and nonskin cancer. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider immediately for any skin changes, including a new wart, skin sore, or bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in the size or color of a mole.

When Tafinlar is used in combination with Mekinist, it can cause serious bleeding problems, especially in the brain or stomach, that can lead to death. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider and get medical help right away if they have any signs of bleeding, including headaches, dizziness, or feel weak, cough up blood or blood clots, vomit blood or their vomit looks like “coffee grounds,” or red or black stools that look like tar.

Mekinist, alone or in combination with Tafinlar, can cause inflammation of the intestines or tears in the stomach or intestines that can lead to death. Patients should report to their health care provider immediately if they have any of the following symptoms: bleeding, diarrhea (loose stools) or more bowel movements than usual, stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tenderness, fever, or nausea.

Hosting webcast for investors today, Monday, August 24, at 8:30 a.m. ET
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Bionano Genomics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BNGO) today announced that it has acquired Lineagen Inc., a Salt Lake City, Utah based genetic diagnostic company, further supporting our market leadership in digital cytogenetics and comprehensive genetic diagnostics for pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders. Bionano aims to revolutionize clinical genome testing and genomics research by making comprehensive structural variation analysis a routine process that is accurate, streamlined, efficient and cost effective. Bionano’s Saphyr genome imaging platform has been shown to outperform the current gold standard methods for clinical cytogenetic testing, karyotyping, chromosomal microarray (CMA) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). Lineagen specializes in pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and developmental delay, and has developed proprietary technology and commercialized multiple LDTs. With the acquisition of Lineagen, Bionano adds CLIA-certified diagnostic testing services along with expertise in commercializing cytogenetic assays, genetic counseling, third party payor contracts and reimbursement.

“Lineagen has been a pioneer in clinical testing for structural variations in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay and other constitutional genetic diseases. These are indications where the information provided by Lineagen’s menu of assays can significantly improve management and they are core areas of strategic and clinical interest to Bionano. This acquisition adds that business and accelerates our efforts to bring Saphyr to clinical testing within a CLIA environment by adding essential skills and relationships with physicians and payors in place at Lineagen,” said Erik Holmlin, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Bionano Genomics. “We believe the incredible talent and clinical experience at Lineagen, working together with Alka Chaubey, recently appointed as our first Chief Medical Officer, will help drive the development and launch of a menu of genomic assays based on Saphyr’s simple, straightforward workflow. By doing so, we provide a roadmap for others to follow, setting Saphyr on track to consolidate and enhance existing cytogenetic workflows around the world. I want to thank Michael Paul, the founder and CEO of Lineagen, and his board, investors and employees for believing in the power of this combination. Our work is just beginning.”

Michael Paul, PhD, Chief Strategy Officer of Bionano and former CEO of Lineagen added, “Bionano Genomics is a natural fit for Lineagen. Beginning with the commercial introduction of our FirstStepDx Plus assay over nine years ago, which is based on structural variation detection, Lineagen demonstrated that we could innovate in the established field of cytogenetics by combining proprietary content, interpretation software, and genomics databases with state-of-the-art genome analysis technology. Bionano’s Saphyr system for comprehensive structural variation analysis allows the combined companies to expand and accelerate this innovation process and develop, validate and introduce novel tests that outperform those based on traditional sequencing or cytogenetic technologies. Together with Erik and the Bionano team, we are eager and committed to continue our mission of serving individuals with ASD and other disorders of childhood development, their families, and providers with advanced genetic diagnostic solutions. It is time to get to work.”

Bionano paid approximately $9.6 million in consideration for Lineagen, consisting of 6,167,510 shares of Bionano’s common stock, approximately $1.7 million in cash and assumption of approximately $2.9 million in liabilities. Concurrent with the closing of the merger, Bionano also paid approximately $1.1 million to satisfy outstanding principal and accrued interest amounts due pursuant to a Paycheck Protection Program loan issued to Lineagen under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Lineagen was advised by EVOLUTION Life Science Partners in connection with the merger.

46837,Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) Receives Two New PMDA's Approvals in Japan,Merck’s KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Receives Two New Approvals in Japan,"The first approval is for certain ESCC patients, which is based on P-III KEYNOTE-181 trial assessing Keytruda vs CT in patients with recurrent or metastatic ESCC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥10). The study demonstrated mOS (10.3 vs 6.7mos.)
 Additionally, Keytruda received approval for use at an additional recommended dosage of 400mg, q6w, IV over 30 minutes across all adult indications, including both monothx. and combination therapy
 The approval for q6w dosing regimen is based on PK modeling and exposure-response analyses & was supported by an interim analysis of KEYNOTE-555 from a cohort of patients (Cohort B) treated with Keytruda (400mg, q6w). With the approvals, Keytruda has 13 indications across seven tumor types plus MSI-H tumors in Japan","KEYTRUDA Now Approved for Patients With PD-L1-Positive Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Who Have Progressed After Chemotherapy and for a Six-Week Dosing Schedule Across All Adult Indications

Six-Week Dosing Schedule for KEYTRUDA Now Approved in Japan, US and Europe

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, has received two new approvals from the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). KEYTRUDA monotherapy is now approved for the treatment of patients whose tumors are PD-L1-positive, and have radically unresectable, advanced or recurrent esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who have progressed after chemotherapy. Additionally, KEYTRUDA was approved for use at an additional recommended dosage of 400 mg every six weeks (Q6W) administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes across all adult indications, including KEYTRUDA monotherapy and combination therapy. This new dosage option will be available in addition to the current dose of 200 mg every three weeks (Q3W). With these approvals, KEYTRUDA has 13 indications across seven tumor types plus MSI-H tumors in Japan.

“We remain committed to improving outcomes for as many patients with cancer as possible, including those with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which is a leading cause of cancer-related death in Japan,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “With today’s approvals, specific patients with esophageal cancer can receive a much-needed new treatment option, and adult patients receiving KEYTRUDA will now have the option of a dosing schedule that reduces how often they are at the clinic for treatment.”

The approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of certain patients with ESCC is based on results from the global Phase 3 KEYNOTE-181 trial, in which an improvement in overall survival (OS) was observed for KEYTRUDA monotherapy compared with chemotherapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel or irinotecan) in patients with recurrent or metastatic ESCC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥10) (HR=0.64 [95% CI, 0.46-0.90]). The median OS was 10.3 months (95% CI, 7.0-13.5) for KEYTRUDA compared with 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.8-8.6) for chemotherapy.

The approval of KEYTRUDA for a Q6W dosing regimen is based on pharmacokinetic modeling and exposure-response analyses. The pharmacokinetic modeling data was supported by an interim analysis of pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety data from KEYNOTE-555 from a cohort of patients (Cohort B) treated with KEYTRUDA 400 mg Q6W.

“In Japan, more than 90% of esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Patients with advanced disease face a poor prognosis and are in critical need of new treatment options,” said Jannie Oosthuizen, president, MSD Japan. “These approvals reinforce our commitment to innovative research that will continue to help more patients with cancer in Japan.”

About Esophageal Cancer in Japan

Esophageal cancer, a type of cancer that is particularly difficult to treat, begins in the inner layer (mucosa) of the esophagus and grows outward. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. In Japan, more than 90% of all esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Globally, esophageal cancer is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer, and it is estimated there were more than 572,000 new esophageal cancer cases and nearly 509,000 deaths resulting from the disease in 2018.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions

Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

AstraZeneca optimized the mAbs with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor binding","First participants dosed in trial of AZD7442 to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the combination   
The first participants have been dosed in a Phase I trial of AZD7442, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

The trial, called NCT04507256, will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD7442.1 The trial will include up to 48 healthy participants in the UK aged 18 to 55 years and is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), part of the US Department of Defense, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “This trial is an important milestone in the development of our monoclonal antibody combination to prevent or treat COVID-19. This combination of antibodies, coupled to our proprietary half-life extension technology, has the potential to improve both the effectiveness and durability of use in addition to reducing the likelihood of viral resistance.”

Should AZD7442 prove to be tolerated and have a favourable safety profile in the trial, AstraZeneca will progress it into larger late-stage Phase II and Phase III trials to evaluate its efficacy as a potential preventative and treatment approach against COVID-19.

Synthesised in the laboratory, mAbs aim to mimic natural antibodies. The treatment has the potential to be given as a preventative option for people exposed to the virus, and to treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected by the virus.

AZD7442

AZD7442 is a combination of two mAbs derived from convalescent patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and licensed to AstraZeneca in June 2020, the mAbs were optimised by AstraZeneca with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor binding. The half-life extended mAbs should afford at least six months of protection from COVID-19.2-5 In a recent Nature publication, the mAbs were shown preclinically to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to host cells and protect against infection in cell and animal models of disease.6

NCT04507256

NCT04507256 is a Phase I, first time in human, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and dose escalation study that aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD7442 in healthy participants.1 Data readout is anticipated in the second half of 2020.

 The license covers αvβ6 integrin inhibitors including MORF-720 and MORF-627, supported by an extensive preclinical data demonstrating potential as treatments for IPF as well as other fibrotic diseases
 Under the original deal, Morphic would handle R&D work on its pipeline through IND-enabling studies, after which AbbVie has an option to take each compound for global development and commercialization","AbbVie to pay Morphic license fee of $20 million, with future potential milestones and royalties

AbbVie to lead further development and commercialization

WALTHAM, Mass., Aug. 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Morphic Therapeutic (NASDAQ: MORF), a biopharmaceutical company developing a new generation of oral integrin therapies for the treatment of serious chronic diseases, and AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that AbbVie has exercised a license option under the companies’ research and development collaboration agreement to develop Morphic’s αvβ6 integrin inhibitors for the treatment of fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and additional indications. The αvβ6 integrin activates transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a key driver of tissue fibrosis. The license covers αvβ6 integrin specific inhibitors discovered from Morphic’s proprietary MInT Platform, including the compounds MORF-720 and MORF-627, which are supported by an extensive preclinical data package demonstrating potential as treatments for IPF as well as other fibrotic diseases. Pursuant to the agreement between Morphic and AbbVie, Morphic will receive a license fee of $20 million, with potential future development milestone payments and royalties from the sales of any commercialized candidates.

“The preclinical data strongly support Morphic’s selective small molecule inhibitors of αvβ6 for development in fibrotic disease. AbbVie has been an excellent partner through the preclinical development of this program and we believe that their decision to assume leadership for the next stages of development is a strong vote of confidence in our collaboration, as well as Morphic’s MInT platform to generate orally available integrin inhibitors,” said Praveen Tipirneni, MD, president and chief executive officer of Morphic Therapeutic.

About the Morphic-AbbVie Agreement
Under the terms of the original agreement, AbbVie paid Morphic an upfront payment of $100 million for exclusive license options on product candidates directed at multiple targets. For each target, Morphic will conduct R&D activities through the completion of IND-enabling studies, at which point AbbVie may pay a license fee to exercise its exclusive license option and assume responsibility for global development and commercialization. Morphic is also eligible for additional, undisclosed clinical and commercial milestone payments and tiered royalties on worldwide net sales for each compound. Morphic retains cost-sharing rights in the development of liver fibrosis indications, and may opt into paying a percentage of AbbVie’s development costs in exchange for enhanced royalties.

About Fibrosis and TGF-β
Fibrosis occurs when chronic inflammation or persistent injury leads to the development of excessive connective tissue, which can lead to organ damage and impaired function. Fibrotic diseases can affect nearly all tissues and organ systems and, due to limited treatment options, can cause serious illness and death.

The pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-β is a key regulator of fibrosis, but attempts to globally suppress its activity have suffered from a narrow therapeutic index (dose-limiting toxicity). Several integrins, such as αvβ6, play a dominant role in local activation of TGF-β in diseased tissues. Inhibition of these integrins is therefore a compelling strategy for treating chronic fibrotic diseases with significant advantage over global TGF-β inhibitors.

About Morphic Therapeutic
Morphic Therapeutic is a biopharmaceutical company developing a new generation of oral integrin therapies for the treatment of serious chronic diseases, including autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, fibrosis and cancer. In collaboration with AbbVie, Janssen, and Schrödinger, Morphic is advancing its pipeline and discovery activities using its proprietary MInT technology platform which leverages the Company’s unique understanding of integrin structure and biology.

– Phase 2 initiation planned for the first half of 2021

SAN DIEGO & FORT WORTH, Texas–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Aug. 25, 2020– ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAD) today announced the acquisition of CerSci Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology company with worldwide rights to a portfolio of novel compounds for neurological conditions, including non-opioid therapies for acute and chronic pain. The lead development program is a unique Reactive Species Decomposition Accelerant (RSDAx), a first-in-class mechanism focused on interrupting pathways that sensitize neurons to pain. The portfolio contains additional preclinical stage molecules, including brain penetrant molecules, with potential for symptomatic and disease modifying treatment utility in neurodegenerative diseases.

This acquisition strengthens ACADIA’s clinical pipeline to include non-opioid pain therapies that have potential non-addictive properties and reduced side effects typically seen with current opioid treatments. The lead molecule, ACP-044, has shown promising efficacy and safety results in animal models evaluating incisional, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain, as well as favorable tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties in Phase 1 trials. The novel RSDAx mechanism of action is thought to interfere with multiple pain pathways treating pain simultaneously. ACADIA plans to initiate a Phase 2 clinical study in the first half of 2021.

“There is an urgent need for new approaches to treat pain without causing addiction,” said Steve Davis, ACADIA’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are excited by the potential clinical utility of this program across multiple pain modalities due to its novel non-opioid mechanism of action. By acquiring CerSci, ACADIA is further strengthening our development pipeline for long-term growth in central nervous system disorders.”

In the ELEKTRA DS cohort (n=51), patients treated with soticlestat demonstrated a 33.8% median reduction in convulsive seizure frequency compared to a 7.0% median increase in patients taking placebo during the full 20-week treatment period of the study (median placebo-adjusted reduction in seizure frequency is 46.0%; p=0.0007). Based on these data, the companies plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss initiation of a Phase 3 registrational program for soticlestat in patients with DS.

In the ELEKTRA LGS cohort (n=88), patients treated with soticlestat demonstrated a 20.6% median reduction in drop seizure frequency compared to a 6.0.% median reduction in patients taking placebo during the full 20-week treatment period of the study (median placebo-adjusted reduction in seizure frequency is 14.8%; p=0.1279). Additional analyses are being conducted to better understand the potential next steps for the development of soticlestat in this highly heterogenous patient population.

Soticlestat was generally well-tolerated in the ELEKTRA study and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with those of previous studies, with no new safety signals identified. All patients who completed the ELEKTRA study elected to enroll into the ENDYMION open-label extension study and findings from ENDYMION are also reported today.

“We are extremely encouraged by these results, which show a clear statistically significant reduction of seizures in Dravet syndrome patients treated with soticlestat, as well as a trend for seizure reduction in Lennox-Gastaut patients,” said Amit Rakhit, M.D., MBA, President and Chief Medical Officer of Ovid. “We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Takeda to initiate a Phase 3 registrational program for soticlestat in patients with DS, while continuing to analyze the data from patients with LGS in the ELEKTRA and ENDYMION studies to define potential next steps. We also expect to report data from the open-label Phase 2 ARCADE study with soticlestat in patients with CDKL5 deficiency disorder and Dup15q syndrome, two other types of highly-refractory DEEs, later this quarter.”

“It is exciting to see these positive results and to advance soticlestat into late stage clinical development — initially for the potential treatment of children with Dravet syndrome who need more options to manage treatment-resistant seizures,” said Sarah Sheikh, M.D., M.Sc., MRCP, Head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area Unit at Takeda. “Soticlestat and its novel mechanism of action were discovered at Takeda and we are enthusiastic about continuing to advance the science and clinical programs as one aligned team, in strong partnership with Ovid Therapeutics.”

“Children with developmental epileptic encephalopathies like DS and LGS need more options to manage their treatment-resistant seizures,” said Dr. Cecil Hahn, M.D., MPH, a Child Neurologist at The Hospital for Sick Children and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Toronto. “The results of the ELEKTRA study are very promising, particularly for children with DS and represent a clinically significant reduction in seizure burden. Moreover, soticlestat was well-tolerated in this study.”

Phase 2 ELEKTRA Study Design and Patient Baseline Demographics

ELEKTRA was an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate treatment with soticlestat in pediatric patients, aged 2 to 17 years, with highly refractory epileptic seizures associated with DS (convulsive seizures) or LGS (drop seizures). The study consisted of a four- to six-week screening period to establish baseline seizure frequency, followed by a 20-week double-blind treatment period, including an 8-week dose optimization period and a 12-week maintenance period. During the 8-week dose optimization period, patients were titrated from 100mg twice daily (BID), to 200mg BID to 300mg BID (mg/kg dosing for <60 kg) of orally administered soticlestat.

A total of 141 patients were enrolled in ELEKTRA and 126 completed the study. A modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis of 139 patients was performed to evaluate the efficacy endpoints, which includes any patient who enrolled in the study and received at least one dose of study drug. Patients in the study were allowed to be on one to four concomitant anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), with the majority of patients concomitantly treated with at least three AEDs. The most common AEDs taken by the patients were valproate, clobazam, levetiracetam and topiramate.

Phase 2 ELEKTRA Topline Efficacy Results

The study achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating a 27.8% median reduction from baseline in convulsive seizure (DS) and drop seizure (LGS) frequency compared to a 3.1% median increase in patients on placebo during the 12-week maintenance period (median placebo-adjusted reduction=30.5%; p=0.0007, based on the efficacy analysis set of 120 patients with seizure data in the maintenance period). During the full 20-week treatment period of the mITT DS patient population, the median percent change from baseline was a 33.8% decrease in seizure frequency compared to a 7.0% increase in seizure frequency for patients receiving placebo (median placebo-adjusted reduction=46.0%; p=0.0007). During the full treatment period of the mITT LGS patient population, the median percent change from baseline was a 20.6% decrease in seizure frequency compared to a 6.0% decrease in patients receiving placebo (median placebo-adjusted reduction=14.8%; p=0.1279).

Phase 2 ELEKTRA Topline Safety Results

Soticlestat was well tolerated in this study. These findings were consistent with previous studies and no new safety signals were identified. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was similar in both the treatment and placebo groups with 57 (80.3%) of soticlestat patients experiencing at least one treatment emergent adverse event compared to 52 (74.3%) placebo patients. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events reported in soticlestat-treated patients with ≥5% difference from placebo were lethargy and constipation. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in both soticlestat and placebo groups, with 11 (15.5%) in soticlestat experiencing at least one treatment emergent serious adverse event compared to 13 (18.6%) in placebo. There were no deaths reported.

ENDYMION Open-Label Extension Study Update

All patients who completed the ELEKTRA trial elected to roll over into the ENDYMION open-label extension study. The primary objective of ENDYMION is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of soticlestat over four years of treatment in patients with rare epilepsies and, secondarily, to evaluate the effect of soticlestat on seizure frequency over time.

Data from the ELEKTRA patients who have rolled over into the ENDYMION study are supportive of results in the core study. The data indicate maintenance of effect over 6 months in those patients originally randomized to soticlestat, and similarly reduced seizure frequency as compared to baseline in those patients previously assigned to the placebo arm. No new safety signals were identified in ENDYMION.

About Soticlestat (TAK-935/OV935)

Soticlestat is a potent, highly selective, first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H), with the potential to reduce seizure susceptibility and improve seizure control. CH24H is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it converts cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC) to adjust the homeostatic balance of brain cholesterol. 24HC is a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor and modulates glutamatergic signaling associated with epilepsy. Glutamate is one of the main neurotransmitters in the brain and has been shown to play a role in the initiation and spread of seizure activity. Recent literature indicates that CH24H is involved in over-activation of the glutamatergic pathway through modulation of the NMDA channel and that increased expression of CH24H can disrupt the reuptake of glutamate by astrocytes, resulting in epileptogenesis and neurotoxicity. Inhibition of CH24H by soticlestat reduces the neuronal levels of 24HC and may improve excitatory/inhibitory balance of NMDA channel activity.

Takeda and Ovid are sharing in the development and commercialization costs of soticlestat on a 50/50 basis and, if successful, the companies will share in the profits on a 50/50 basis. Takeda will be responsible for commercialization in Japan and has the option to be responsible for commercialization in other countries in Asia and other selected countries. Ovid will be responsible for clinical development activities and commercialization of soticlestat in the United States, Europe, Canada and Israel. Under the terms of the agreement, Takeda received equity in Ovid and may be eligible to receive certain milestone payments based on the advancement of soticlestat.

About Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome

Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are types of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), a heterogeneous group of rare epilepsy syndromes. Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome typically become apparent during infancy or early childhood and are highly refractory to many antiseizure medications.

Dravet syndrome is most commonly caused by a genetic mutation in the SCN1A gene and affects approximately 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 21,000 people in the United States. Dravet syndrome is characterized by prolonged focal seizures that can evolve to convulsive tonic-clonic seizures. Children with Dravet syndrome experience developmental disabilities as seizures increase. Other common symptoms include changes in appetite, difficulty balancing and a crouched gait when walking.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 11,000 people in the United States. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a heterogeneous condition and characterized by several different types of seizures, most commonly atonic (drop), tonic and atypical absence seizures. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may also develop cognitive dysfunction, delays in reaching developmental milestones and behavioral problems. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, but in some cases no cause can be identified.

 Asciminib (ABL001) is an investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP), being evaluated in multiple clinical studies addressing the needs of CML patients. The US FDA has granted FT designation for the therapy","At primary analysis, ASCEMBL met its primary endpoint of significant superiority in major molecular response rate at 24 weeks for asciminib (ABL001) vs. bosutinib in patients previously treated with two or more tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs)1
Despite advances in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) care, many patients are at risk of disease progression, and sequential TKI therapy may be associated with increased resistance and intolerance2-7
By specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket, STAMP inhibition has the potential to help address resistance and intolerance in later treatment lines for CML8-14; additional studies seek to evaluate asciminib in earlier lines of therapy15
ASCEMBL results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting and shared with regulatory authorities; FDA has granted asciminib Fast Track designation
Basel, August 26, 2020 — Novartis announced today that, at primary analysis, the Phase III ASCEMBL study met its primary endpoint of statistically significant superiority in major molecular response (MMR) rate at 24 weeks for asciminib (ABL001) vs. bosutinib1. The study evaluates asciminib – a novel investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP) – in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs)1. Patients with failure or intolerance to the most recently administered TKI therapy were included in the trial1.

“Our ability to treat patients with TKIs changed CML care forever. However, the risk of disease progression is a reality for many patients – especially those who experience resistance to sequential TKI therapy or those who cannot adhere to treatment due to the daily impact of intolerable side effects16,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “We are incredibly grateful to the patients and investigators around the world who participated in this study. These results with asciminib are a testament to our commitment to further transform CML care – this time through STAMP inhibition, by exploiting a natural regulatory mechanism of the ABL kinase.”

Data from the ASCEMBL trial will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting, and results will be shared with regulatory authorities. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for asciminib.

Findings from earlier studies of asciminib were presented during past annual meetings of the European Hematology Association, and some details can be found here13,14.

About asciminib (ABL001)
Asciminib (ABL001) is an investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP). As a STAMP inhibitor, asciminib may help address tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistance and intolerance in later treatment lines of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)8-14, and it is being studied in several clinical trials in hopes of helping patients across multiple treatment lines of CML7,10,11,13-15,17.

“Increased testing is the only way to gain visibility on the magnitude of the pandemic, which will ultimately lead to helping control it,” said Dr. Davide Manissero, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of QIAGEN. “As a trusted partner in the fight against COVID-19, QIAGEN has now added the Access Anti-SARS-CoV-2 to our portfolio as a smart solution for antibody testing that provides results with confidence. This is a rugged and portable platform that requires no hardware, can process a wide range of tests and provides fast results. We look forward to working with Ellume to discover and develop additional tests for this platform.”

The test is performed on the eHub, a small portable digital device that provides reliable results in 10 minutes. Each eHub can handle up to eight patient samples simultaneously and can perform up to 32 total tests per hour. The nanoparticle fluorescent detection technology uses serum or plasma from patient samples. The same platform is being used for QuantiFERON-TB Access, a new solution in development for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection in low-resource regions with a high TB disease burden.

Currently available rapid lateral flow antibody tests fall short when it comes to the automated and convenient read-out of results. Manual and visual result reporting, and potential pitfalls in read-out timing can lead of uncertain testing results. The Access Anti-SARS-CoV-2 eHub and digital eStick approach mitigates those risks, providing reliable results no matter when the results are read and also providing true walk-away capability to free up laboratory personnel.

Serological testing for antibodies is central to identifying people who have been recently infected by the virus or have been infected in the recent past, especially those who did not show any symptoms and therefore might not know of an infection. Understanding more about COVID-19 immunity in a population could help societies return faster to normal daily routines by helping to inform and guide public health measures, such as contact tracing and individual measures under clinical guidance. Antibody testing could also become fundamental in supporting vaccine development as well as guiding, planning, and assessing future SARS-CoV-2 immunization programs.

Access Anti-SARS-CoV-2 will complement QIAGEN’s array of COVID-19 testing solutions with a cost-effective way to detect immune responses in people who have been exposed to the virus.

QIAGEN employees around the world are fully mobilized to address the urgent demand for testing solutions needed in the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. QIAGEN’s initiatives focus on building the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions for COVID-19 testing. These include production of viral RNA extraction for use on QIAGEN’s QIAcube, QIAsymphony and EZ1 platforms as well as third-party instruments; building up a range of PCR tests on the QIAstat-Dx and NeuMoDx systems that enable COVID-19 detection while analyzing samples at the same time for other respiratory infections; QIAGEN is also providing universal next-generation sequencing (NGS) solutions for research use with any sequencer, in particular gene panels integrated with bioinformatics for analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. QIAGEN is also scaling up production capacity for reagents sold to other companies for use in their own COVID-19 tests.

46982,Philips and B. Braun's Onvision Needle Tip Tracking Technology Receive the US FDA's 510 (k) Clearance for Regional Anesthesia,Philips and B. Braun receive FDA clearance for breakthrough Onvision needle tip tracking technology for regional anesthesia,"Onvision needle tip tracking technology will be exclusively available on the latest version of the B. Braun and Philips’ Xperius ultrasound system together with the Stimuplex Onvision needle, empowering anesthesiologists to embrace regional anesthesia as a viable and effective alternative to general anesthesia.
 It allows anesthesiologists the confidence to accurately position the needle tip inside the body for PNBs and helps the user to align the needle with the probe in a user-friendly interface leading to a reduction in procedural time
 Onvision needle tip tracking technology indicates the position of the needle tip in relation to the ultrasound viewing plane to an accuracy of 3mm and is expected to be available in the US in Q4’20. The solution is CE marked and is available for sale across the EU and Chile","Amsterdam, the Netherlands – Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, and B. Braun, a global market leader [1] in regional anesthesia and pain management, today announced 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Onvision, a breakthrough ultrasound guidance solution for real-time needle tip tracking. Available exclusively on the latest version of the B. Braun and Philips Xperiusultrasound system together with the dedicated Stimuplex Onvision needle, Onvision gives anesthesiologists the confidence to accurately position the needle tip inside the body for Peripheral Nerve Blocks (PNBs). 

 

Accurate needle placement is critical to the success of regional anesthesia procedures such as PNBs. While real-time ultrasound imaging has proved to be a valuable tool for needle guidance, failure to optimally visualize the needle tip remains a challenge, with 10-15% of all PNBs ineffective after a single-injection technique [2]. In real-time, Onvision accurately indicates where the needle tip is inside the body, both in and out of the ultrasound viewing plane [3]. It helps the user align the needle with the probe in a user-friendly interface that can lead to a reduction in procedural time [4]. 

 

“When I first started to use Onvision, I didn’t think that we would increase the number of out-of-plane procedures, but I was happily surprised we did,” said Paul Kessler M.D. Ph.D., Vice Chairman, Clinic of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt (Germany). “Onvision gives you the extra assurance to perform deep and difficult blocks both in- and out-of-plane.”

 

FDA clearance for Onvision represents the latest advance in a multi-year strategic alliance between Philips and B. Braun to innovate in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia, a rapidly growing alternative to general anesthesia. Regional anesthesia is an essential part of pain therapy and offers clear advantages when compared to general anesthesia such as pain elimination during and after surgery [5], improved functional outcomes [6], and faster mobilization [7].

The increased confidence and predictability offered by the Xperius Ultrasound System and Onvision Needle Tip Tracking is empowering more anesthesiologists to embrace regional anesthesia as a viable and effective alternative to general anesthesia.

Head of Innovation for Image Guided Therapy at Philips

“The increased confidence and predictability offered by the Xperius Ultrasound System and Onvision Needle Tip Tracking is empowering more anesthesiologists to embrace regional anesthesia as a viable and effective alternative to general anesthesia,” said Tobin Taylor-Bhatia, Head of Innovation for Image Guided Therapy at Philips. “By innovating together with B. Braun we’ve created a solution to one of the biggest challenges in regional anesthesia – accurate positioning of the needle tip in the body.”

 

“Onvision is the groundbreaking technology that allows anesthesiologists the predictability [4] and confidence [4] they need while positioning the needle during a procedure,” said Dr. Angela Karpf, M.D., Corporate Vice President of Medical Affairs at B. Braun. “B. Braun continues to add products to our regional anesthesia therapy portfolio that help achieve faster postsurgical recoveries, optimize procedural workflow and enhance user experience.”

 

Together, B. Braun’s Stimuplex Onvision needles and Philips’ Onvision needle tip tracking technology indicate the position of the needle tip in relation to the ultrasound viewing plane to an accuracy of 3mm [3]. A sensitive micro-sensor placed on the needle, combined with advanced signal processing and visualization techniques on the Xperius system, indicate the real-time location of the needle tip in relation to the 2D ultrasound viewing plane. The solution provides greater flexibility in needle trajectory [8] and can reduce procedure times [4].

 

In addition to FDA clearance, the Onvision solution is CE marked. It is available for sale across the EU and in Chile and is expected to be available in the United States in Q4 2020. For more information about Onvision visit bbraun.com/onvision.

August 25, 2020 04:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Engitix Ltd (‘Engitix’), a biotechnology company developing a portfolio of programmes in fibrosis and solid tumours using its proprietary human extracellular matrix (ECM) platform, today entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (‘Takeda’) to discover and develop novel therapeutics for advanced fibrotic liver diseases, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Under the terms of this agreement, Engitix and Takeda will collaborate in the confirmation and validation of targets and preclinical development of therapeutics in liver fibrosis using Engitix’s unique extracellular matrix (ECM) discovery platform. Takeda will have exclusive rights to develop and commercialise clinical candidates generated against validated targets derived from the collaboration. Engitix will receive an upfront payment, with additional near-term payments based on the confirmation and functional validation of selected targets. Engitix will be eligible to receive more than $500 million for the achievement of preclinical, development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as further royalty payments upon sales of commercialised products.

Dr Giuseppe Mazza, Co-Founder and CEO of Engitix, commented: “Having Takeda, one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies with world-class drug development and commercialization capabilities, as a major collaborator, will accelerate the translation of novel ECM-derived targets into potential therapeutics for humans. We are excited to continue working with Takeda as this is the only partnership in the field of liver fibrosis currently using a human disease-specific ECM platform, paving the way for potential first-in class anti-fibrotic therapeutics”.

By incorporating tissue- and disease-specific human ECM into in vitro models, Engitix’s platform preserves the natural cell microenvironment offering the unique capability of understanding the bioactive role of human ECM in modulating disease progression in fibrosis. By more accurately predicting disease drivers in human samples, the platform has the potential to accelerate discovery and reduce late-stage clinical failures.

Dr Gareth Hicks, Head of the GI Drug Discovery Unit at Takeda, added: “There is a vital need for new treatments that will positively impact the lives of patients with advanced liver diseases. Engitix’s ECM platform offers a powerful tool for identifying and validating novel targets that will be valuable in the development of direct anti-fibrotic therapies. Our partnership with Engitix underscores our commitment to explore innovative approaches to treat late-stage liver disease.”

Liver fibrosis, or scarring, and its life-threatening end stage of liver cirrhosis, is the common pathway of chronic liver diseases (CLDs), such as NASH, alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis and cholangiopathies such as primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. It is estimated that 844 million people have CLDs worldwide, resulting in a mortality rate of 2 million deaths per year. Despite the clear need for effective therapeutics, there are currently no approved medicines to treat CLDs.

Nepexto®is available as an injectable in an easy-to-use pre-filled pen and a pre-filled syringe
The approval of Nepexto®by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) underlines the scientific success of Lupin’s biosimilar programs
Mumbai, India | BAD HOMBURG, Germany, August 26, 2020: Lupin Limited (Lupin) and Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ: MYL) announced today the launch of Nepexto®, biosimilar etanercept, in the German market. Nepexto® is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis from the age of 2 years, active and progressive psoriatic arthritis, severe axial spondyloarthritis, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years. Nepexto® is approved for all therapeutic indications of the reference product Enbrel®.

Etanercept as an established therapy option

The Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitor etanercept was first approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Germany in 2000 and since then has offered an effective treatment option for several chronic inflammatory diseases.

“TNF inhibitors such as etanercept make it possible to intervene precisely in the inflammatory process,” commented Prof. Dr. med. Rieke Alten, chief physician in the Department of Internal Medicine (Rheumatology, Clinical Immunology, Osteology) at the Schlosspark-Klinik Charlottenburg, Berlin. “In patients with moderately severe to severe rheumatoid arthritis who do not respond adequately to basic therapeutics, remission of the disease through therapy with etanercept in combination with methotrexate is a quite realistic therapeutic goal. Rheumatologists have many years of clinical experience with this substance in terms of its efficacy and safety profile. Rheumatologists particularly like to opt for etanercept when ‘safety first’ is the top priority. Besides rheumatoid arthritis, this TNF inhibitor is also firmly established in other rheumatological indications.”

Simple application by means of pre-filled pen

Nepexto® is available as a solution for injection in a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe. Data show a high patient acceptance of the easy-to-handle pre-filled pen. Patients favored this latex-free device for self-injection, which can lead to improvement in compliance.

Cost-effective treatment with Nepexto®

Nepexto®, with an equivalent efficacy and safety to reference product Enbrel®, is an attractive cost-effective treatment alternative that can contribute to sustainable healthcare and treatment options. The European Commission approved the marketing authorization of Nepexto® on June 4, 2020 after the biosimilar received a favorable opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The CHMP concluded that the development program including analytical, functional, clinical and immunogenicity data, demonstrated biosimilarity with its reference product, Enbrel®.

Thierry Volle, President, EMEA, Lupin said, “We are excited to bring Nepexto® in Germany. Nepexto® is our first biosimilar to receive regulatory approval in Europe. This launch is a remarkable milestone for our biosimilar group and we are glad that we are able to bring an affordable biosimilar to the European market through our partner Mylan. Biosimilars like Nepexto® will play a vital role in expanding access to effective treatment for multiple therapies including rheumatoid arthritis.”

Dr. Maximilian von Wülfing, Managing Director of Mylan Germany said, “Germany is the first country in Europe to introduce Nepexto®, the etanercept from Mylan. The approval of Nepexto® (etanercept) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) once again underlines the scientific success of Mylan’s biologics program. To date Mylan has launched and commercialized four biosimilar products in Germany, two in immunology and two in oncology. Mylan offers a comprehensive and diverse biologics pipeline, and we want to make as many of these complex drugs as possible available to patients in Germany.”

Nepexto is the second immunology product to be introduced into the German market. In addition to Hulio®, an adalimumab biosimilar, Nepexto® expands Mylan’s therapeutic portfolio for the effective treatment of various immune-mediated diseases including rheumatoid arthritis.

About Etanercept

Etanercept is an injectable biologic medicine that inhibits the biological activity of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF). TNF is a key cytokine involved in the pro-inflammatory cascade in many chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis and plaque psoriasis. Etanercept as a soluble TNF receptor fusion protein specifically binds to TNF and blocks its activity, thereby reducing inflammation and disease symptoms.

47046,GSK's Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin) Receives EC's Approval for R/R Multiple Myeloma,European Commission approves BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin) for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma,"The EC’s approval is based on DREAMM-2 study assessing Blenrep (2.5/ 3.4 mg/kg, q3w) as monothx. in adult patients prior treated with 4 therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 mAb, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy
 The data demonstrated that Blenrep (2.5 mg/kg dose, q3w) resulted in 32% ORR, mDoR (11mos.) & mOS (13.7mos.) while the safety and tolerability profile is consistent with previous data of the therapy
 Blenrep is a BCMA mAb conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F via a non-cleavable linker and has received EMA’s PRIME designation in 2017","For media and investors only
Issued: London, UK

BLENREP is the first anti-BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) therapy approved in the European Union
Marketing authorisation follows the recent US approval of BLENREP
GlaxoSmithKline plc today announced the European Commission has granted conditional marketing authorisation for BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin) as monotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. BLENREP is a first-in-class humanised anti-BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) treatment for these patients whose disease has progressed despite the current standard of care.

Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “The approval of BLENREP marks an important step forward for patients in Europe where nearly 50,000 new cases of multiple myeloma are diagnosed each year. Unfortunately, most of these patients will relapse or stop responding to current therapies so I am pleased that today’s news will give patients with limited treatment options access to the first approved anti-BCMA therapy.”

The approval is based on data from the pivotal DREAMM-2 (DRiving Excellence in Approaches to Multiple Myeloma) study, including 13-month follow-up data. These data demonstrated that treatment with single-agent BLENREP, administered as a 2.5 mg/kg dose every three weeks (Q3W), resulted in an overall response rate of 32%. The median duration of response was 11 months and median overall survival was 13.7 months.

The safety and tolerability profile were consistent with previously reported data on BLENREP. The most commonly reported adverse events in the 2.5 mg/kg arm (greater than or equal to 20%) were keratopathy/microcyst-like epithelial changes or MECs (71%), thrombocytopenia (38%), anaemia (27%), blurred vision events (25%), nausea (25%), pyrexia (23%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (21%), infusion-related reactions (21%), and lymphopenia (20%).

Dr Katja Weisel, Deputy Director and Associate Professor of Haematology/Oncology in the Department of Oncology, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Department of Pneumonology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany and an investigator for the DREAMM-2 trial, said: “Despite advances in treatment, multiple myeloma remains incurable and patients continue to cycle through therapies, with their prognosis worsening with each relapse. The approval of BLENREP, with its novel mechanism of action, represents a new class of treatment that patients can turn to when their cancer stops responding to other standard of care options.”

BLENREP employs a multi-faceted mechanism of action and is directed toward BCMA, a cell-surface protein that plays an important role in the survival of plasma cells and is expressed on multiple myeloma cells.[1]

Dr Brian G.M. Durie, Chairman of the Board of the International Myeloma Foundation, said: “The EC approval of BLENREP is good news for patients with refractory multiple myeloma whose cancer continues to progress and are in dire need of new treatment options. We appreciate GSK’s efforts to bring this new therapy to patients in the EU and for the commitment to addressing the needs of the multiple myeloma community.”

BLENREP was granted PRIME designation in 2017 and the Conditional Marketing Authorisation Application was reviewed under European Medicines Agency’s accelerated assessment procedure, which is given if the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use determines the treatment is of major interest from a public health perspective and represents a therapeutic innovation.

Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration approved BLENREP as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, following a priority review for the company’s Biologics License Application.

About DREAMM-2
DREAMM-2 is an open label study of BLENREP. Patients in the trial had actively progressing multiple myeloma that had worsened despite current standard of care and were randomised to two arms to receive either 2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg BLENREP Q3W. Overall, patients in DREAMM-2 had more advanced disease, poorer prognosis and performance status and also had a greater number of prior lines of therapy in comparison with patients in DREAMM-1, the first time in human study of BLENREP.

About multiple myeloma
There are approximately 48,000 new cases of multiple myeloma diagnosed each year across Europe.[2] Research into new treatments is needed as most patients will relapse or become refractory to available therapies.[3]

About B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)
The normal function of BCMA is to promote plasma cell survival by transduction of signals from two known ligands, BAFF (B-cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand). This pathway has been shown to be important for myeloma cell growth and survival. BCMA expression is limited to B cells at later stages of development. BCMA is expressed at varying levels in myeloma patients and BCMA membrane expression is universally detected in myeloma cell lines.[4]

About BLENREP
BLENREP is an antibody drug conjugate comprising a humanised anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F via non-cleavable linker. The drug linker technology is licensed from Seattle Genetics; monoclonal antibody is produced using POTELLIGENT Technology licensed from BioWa.

Important information for BLENREP in the EU
Indication

BLENREP is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients, who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.

Important safety information
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients

Warnings and precautions: Corneal adverse reactions have been reported with BLENREP (keratopathy or microcyst-like epithelial changes in corneal epithelium with or without changes in visual acuity, blurred vision, and dry eye symptoms). Ophthalmic examinations including assessment of visual acuity and slit lamp examination, should be performed at baseline, before the subsequent 3 treatment cycles and during treatment as clinically indicated. Patients experiencing corneal adverse reactions may require dose modifications or treatment discontinuation based on severity of findings. Cases of corneal ulcer (ulcerative and infective keratitis) have been reported with BLENREP. These should be managed promptly and treatment with BLENREP should be interrupted until the corneal ulcer has healed. Due to the risk of thrombocytopenic events, complete blood counts should be obtained at baseline and monitored during treatment. Patients on concomitant anticoagulant treatments may require more frequent monitoring and should be managed with a dose delay or reductions. If a moderate or severe infusion-related reaction occurs, interrupt infusion and provide supportive treatment. Once symptoms resolve, resume at a lower infusion rate. If anaphylactic or life-threatening infusion reaction, BLENREP should be permanently discontinued.

Undesirable effects: The most commonly-reported adverse reactions were keratopathy and thrombocytopenia. The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, pyrexia and infusion related reactions.

Very common (≥1/10):  Pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, keratopathy, blurred vision events, dry eye, nausea, diarrhoea, pyrexia, fatigue, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased gamma glutamyltransferase and infusion related reactions.

Common (≥1/1000 to <1/10): Upper respiratory tract information, photophobia, eye irritation, vomiting and increased creatine phosphokinase

47102,Abbott's BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card Receives the US FDA's EUA to Detect SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"ABBOTT’S FAST, $5, 15-MINUTE, EASY-TO-USE COVID-19 ANTIGEN TEST RECEIVES FDA EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION; MOBILE APP DISPLAYS TEST RESULTS TO HELP OUR RETURN TO DAILY LIFE; RAMPING PRODUCTION TO 50 MILLION TESTS A MONTH","The US FDA has issued EUA for Abbott’s BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card rapid test for the detection of COVID-19. The test will be available at $5 and can deliver results in 15mins.
 The test utilizes lateral flow technology and has demonstrated a sensitivity of 97.1% and specificity of 98.5% in a clinical study. Additionally, the company has launched the complementary phone app (NAVICA), allowing people to display their BinaxNOW test results in any organizations where people gather like workplaces and schools
 The BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card can be used as a 1L of defense to identify infected people. The company anticipates shipping of ~10M tests in Sept, ramping to 50M tests/ month at the beginning of Oct’2020","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Aug. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Ag Card rapid test for detection of COVID-19 infection. Abbott will sell this test for $5. It is highly portable (about the size of a credit card), affordable and provides results in 15 minutes. BinaxNOW uses proven Abbott lateral flow technology, making it a reliable and familiar format for frequent mass testing through their healthcare provider. With no equipment required, the device will be an important tool to manage risk by quickly identifying infectious people so they don’t spread the disease to others.

Abbott will also launch a complementary mobile app for iPhone and Android devices named NAVICA™. This first-of-its-kind app, available at no charge, will allow people who test negative to display a temporary digital health pass that is renewed each time a person is tested through their healthcare provider together with the date of the test result. Organizations will be able to view and verify the information on a mobile device to facilitate entry into facilities along with hand-washing, social distancing, enhanced cleaning and mask-wearing.

“We intentionally designed the BinaxNOW test and NAVICA app so we could offer a comprehensive testing solution to help Americans feel more confident about their health and lives,” said Robert B. Ford, president and chief executive officer, Abbott. “BinaxNOW and the NAVICA app give us an affordable, easy-to-use, scalable test, and a complementary digital health tool to help us have a bit more normalcy in our daily lives.”

In data submitted to the FDA from a clinical study conducted by Abbott with several leading U.S. research universities, the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card demonstrated sensitivity of 97.1% (positive percent agreement) and specificity of 98.5% (negative percent agreement) in patients suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of symptom onset.

“The massive scale of this test and app will allow tens of millions of people to have access to rapid and reliable testing,” said Joseph Petrosino, Ph.D., professor and chairman, Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, whose labs have been leading efforts to provide COVID-19 testing for the college and Harris County. “With lab-based tests, you get excellent sensitivity but might have to wait days or longer to get the results. With a rapid antigen test, you get a result right away, getting infectious people off the streets and into quarantine so they don’t spread the virus.”

Under FDA EUA, the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card is for use by healthcare professionals and can be used in point-of-care settings that are qualified to have the test performed and are operating under a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation. Within these settings, the test can be performed by doctors, nurses, school nurses, medical assistants and technicians, pharmacists, employer occupational health specialists, and more with minimal training and a patient prescription.

“Our nation’s frontline healthcare workers and clinical laboratory personnel have been under siege since the onset of this pandemic,” said Charles Chiu, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Laboratory Medicine at University of California, San Francisco. “The availability of rapid testing for COVID-19 will help support overburdened laboratories, accelerate turnaround times and greatly expand access to people who need it.”

Currently, AdvaMed (The Advanced Medical Technology Association) estimates that test manufacturers are shipping about 1 million tests per day. Abbott will ship tens of millions of tests in September, ramping to 50 million tests a month at the beginning of October. The company has invested hundreds of millions of dollars since April in two new U.S. facilities to manufacture BinaxNOW at massive scale.

The BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card can be used as a first line of defense to identify people who are currently infected and who should isolate themselves to help prevent the spread of the disease. It is intended for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid protein antigen from SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of symptom onset.

As a near-person rapid antigen test, BinaxNOW was engineered for point-of-care settings, near-patient, and not for reference labs. Patient samples should be tested immediately and should not be diluted in viral transport media.

NAVICA mobile app will help facilitate return to daily activities
Abbott is also offering a mobile app at no charge that will allow people to display their results obtained through a healthcare provider when entering facilities requiring proof of testing. The NAVICA app is optional and an easy-to-use tool that allows people to store, access and display their results with organizations that accept the results so people can move about with greater confidence. The app is supported by Apple and Android digital wallets and will be available from public app stores in the U.S.

“While BinaxNOW is the hardware that makes knowing your COVID-19 status possible, the NAVICA app is the digital network that allows people to share that information with those who need to know,” said Ford. “We’re taking our know-how from our digitally-connected medical devices and applying it to our diagnostics at a time when people expect their health information to be digital and readily accessible.”

If test results are negative, the app will display a digital health pass via a QR code, similar to an airline boarding pass. If test results are positive, people receive a message to quarantine and talk to their doctor. As they’re required to do for all COVID-19 tests, healthcare providers in all settings will be required to report positive results to the CDC and other public health authorities, regardless of whether they use the app. The digital health pass is stored in the app temporarily and expires after the time period specified by organizations that accept the app.

The app’s user interface is supported by a back-end digital infrastructure that is cloud-based, scalable and secure. It’s been designed to support a very large number of users and enable access from anywhere. The app is not for contact tracing and only collects a person’s first and last name, email address, phone number, zip code, date of birth and test results.

About the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card Test
The BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card is an assay for the qualitative detection of specific antigens to COVID-19 in the human nasal cavity. A simple nasal swab is used to collect specimens from people suspected of having an active infection. No equipment is required to process samples or read test results. In addition, minimal chemical reagents are required, which lessens exposure to biohazardous materials and improves safety for those administering the test.

The BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card is the sixth test that Abbott is launching in the U.S. to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. Abbott’s tests are performed on its high-volume m2000™ and Alinity® m molecular laboratory systems; its ID NOW™ rapid molecular point-of-care platform; antibody tests for its high-throughput ARCHITECT® i1000SR and i2000SR and Alinity™ i laboratory instruments.

Abbott has provided more than 27 million COVID-19 tests in the U.S. to date, including 14 million detection tests and 13 million antibody tests.

“By collaborating with BeiGene, we are confident that these important scientific advancements are in good hands for the next stage of their development, as BeiGene has a strong global clinical development organization with a team of more than 1,300 people as well as the reach and drive to bring innovative treatments to the people who need them,” said Janet Xu Zhang, Ph.D., Co-Founder and CEO at Singlomics.

“Dr. Xie has made an important contribution to our understanding of COVID-19, utilizing single cell genomics to find potentially human neutralizing antibodies,” said Lai Wang, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Head of Global Research, Clinical Operations & Biometrics and APAC Clinical Development, at BeiGene. “We are looking forward to initiating clinical trials for this exciting program and to contribute to the worldwide efforts in developing novel treatments for patients with COVID-19.”

A Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial is expected to begin enrolling up to 30 healthy subjects in Australia in September. The Phase 1/2 multinational trial in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 is also expected to begin enrollment by early October. More information on the trials will be available on www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Under the terms of the agreement, Singlomics has granted BeiGene exclusive rights in ex-China territory to develop, manufacture, and commercialize its preclinical assets DXP-593 and DXP-604, as well as for a series of antibody sequences that could target the COVID-19 virus. BeiGene plans to develop one or more of these antibodies globally outside of greater China, while Singlomics will retain rights in greater China. Singlomics will receive an upfront payment and be eligible to receive payments upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones. Singlomics will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties, up to double-digits, on future product sales.

About DXP-593 and DXP-604

DXP-593 and DXP-604 are SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody drug candidates identified by high-throughput single-cell RNA and VDJ sequencing of antigen-enriched B cells from over 60 convalescent patients. DXP-593 has exhibited strong neutralization potency in preclinical testing, with an IC50 of 1.2 ng/mL and 15 ng/mL against pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2, respectively. It displayed strong therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in SARS-CoV-2-infected rodent models. DXP-604 binds to a different epitope from DXP-593, also with demonstrated high potency. DXP-593 and DXP-604 can potentially be used as a cocktail treatment option that could avoid resistance due to viral mutation.

“Despite the rise in digital health services and devices over the last decade, we have not seen a corresponding improvement in population health in the U.S. We are using Amazon’s deep expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to offer customers a new way to discover, adopt, and maintain personalized wellness habits,” said Dr. Maulik Majmudar, Principal Medical Officer, Amazon Halo. “Health is much more than just the number of steps you take in a day or how many hours you sleep. Amazon Halo combines the latest medical science, highly accurate data via the Halo Band sensors, and cutting-edge artificial intelligence to offer a more comprehensive approach to improving your health and wellness.”

Amazon Halo Band—Comfortable, Stylish, and Distraction-Free

Amazon Halo Band is purpose-built to focus on your health and wellness—unlike smartwatches and fitness trackers, it doesn’t have a screen or constant notifications. The small sensor capsule delivers highly accurate data, and includes an accelerometer, a temperature sensor, a heart rate monitor, two microphones, an LED indicator light, and a button to turn the microphones on or off, among other functions. Amazon Halo Band is water resistant for all-day wear and the comfortable fit means it won’t snag or irritate at night. Plus, the battery lasts up to seven days and fully charges in under 90 minutes. Customers can choose from three fabric band colors at purchase, with fabric and silicone sport accessory bands available in 15 additional colors.

A More Comprehensive Approach to Health and Wellness

The Amazon Halo app is a suite of five core features designed to give customers a comprehensive understanding of their health and wellness—and the tools to take action to make measurable improvements:

Activity: Informed by American Heart Association physical activity guidelines and the latest medical research, Amazon Halo awards points based on the intensity and duration of movement, not just the number of steps taken. For example, customers will earn points for walking, but will earn more points for running. Medical guidelines also advise that a sedentary lifestyle can negatively impact health, so Amazon Halo deducts one activity point for every hour over eight hours of sedentary time in a day, outside of sleep. A baseline goal of 150 activity points is set and measured weekly.
Sleep: The health benefits of consistently good, sufficient sleep are well documented—as are the potential negative health impacts of not enough or consistently poor sleep. Amazon Halo uses motion, heart rate, and temperature to measure time asleep and time awake; time spent in the various phases of sleep including deep, light, and REM; and skin temperature while sleeping. The sensors in the band allow for continuous sleep monitoring, so customers get rich, detailed information without having to charge the band every day. In the morning, Amazon Halo delivers a sleep score out of 100, any deviation from baseline sleep temperature, and a hypnogram showing time spent in each sleep phase.
Body: Medical research has shown for years that body fat percentage is a better measure of overall health than just weight or body mass index (BMI) alone, but the tools that measure body fat percentage can be expensive or difficult to access. Using new innovations in computer vision and machine learning, Amazon Halo lets customers measure their body fat percentage from the comfort and privacy of their own home, making this important information easily accessible. The Amazon Halo body fat measurement is as accurate as methods a doctor would use—and nearly twice as accurate as leading at-home smart scales. Learn more about the Body feature.
Tone: The globally accepted definition of health includes not just physical but also social and emotional well-being. The innovative Tone feature uses machine learning to analyze energy and positivity in a customer’s voice so they can better understand how they may sound to others, helping improve their communication and relationships. For example, Tone results may reveal that a difficult work call leads to less positivity in communication with a customer’s family, an indication of the impact of stress on emotional well-being. Learn more about the Tone feature.
Labs: Amazon Halo Labs are science-backed challenges, experiments, and workouts that allow customers to discover what works best for them specifically, so they can build healthier habits—for example, some customers might discover that cutting out afternoon caffeine improves their sleep quality, or that a certain type of at-home workout is more effective than others. Customers can choose from labs created by Amazon Halo experts, as well as brands and personalities they already know, including 8fit, Aaptiv, American Heart Association, Exhale On Demand, Harvard Health Publishing, Headspace, Julian Treasure, Lifesum, Mayo Clinic, Openfit, Orangetheory Fitness, P.volve, Russell Wilson, Relax Melodies, SWEAT, and WW. Additional content from more providers will be added to Labs regularly.
“The American Heart Association is excited about technology that focuses on new and interesting ways for people to improve their cardiovascular health, quality of life, and healthy life years. We’re thrilled to see companies like Amazon innovating in this space,” said Eduardo Sanchez, M.D., MPH, Chief Medical Officer for Prevention, American Heart Association. “The Association is committed to helping people live longer, healthier lives—both physically and mentally. The first step is knowing your current status, and features like Body composition are important advances. Through our Center for Health Technology and Innovation, we are pleased to provide our evidence-based science as part of this solution, which we believe has the potential to drive behavior change towards healthier lives.”

Privacy by Design

Privacy is foundational to Amazon Halo, and multiple layers of privacy and security are built into the service to keep data safe and in customers’ control. Health data is encrypted in transit and in the cloud, and customers can download or delete their data at any time directly from the app. Body scan images are automatically deleted from the cloud after processing, so only the customer sees them. Tone is enabled by creating a personal voice profile, after which it begins capturing short samples of speech and providing insights and daily recaps. Speech samples are always analyzed locally on the customer’s phone and automatically deleted after processing—nobody, not even the customer, ever hears them. Learn more about Amazon Halo privacy features.

Get More with Third Party Program Integrations

Amazon has collaborated with leading health and wellness companies to enable customers to connect their Amazon Halo account to third party programs for even more ways to enhance their health journey. Account linking occurs via the explicit opt-in of the Amazon Halo customer and they can opt back out any time directly from the Halo app.

Members of both WW (formerly Weight Watchers) and Amazon Halo can choose to link their accounts to share Halo Activity information, which the WW app translates to FitPoints. Amazon Halo members also have access to all of WW’s labs any time in the Halo app. WW will offer a variety of promotions, including the ability to get a free Amazon Halo Band and 6 months of membership as part of signing up for a new WW membership. Learn more. “WW is committed to inspiring healthy habits for real life and we are continuously looking for ways to enhance the WW ecosystem. The Amazon Halo Body composition tool is an important complement to weight measurement, and we are thrilled our members will have access to this information on a regular basis from the comfort and privacy of their own homes,” said Mindy Grossman, CEO, WW. “WW members who previewed the Body feature said it was highly motivating in their journey and we are excited to offer WW members a more comprehensive understanding of their wellness through Amazon Halo.”

Amazon Halo will be the featured complimentary wearable for the John Hancock Vitality wellness program, including three years of Halo membership. Vitality members can choose to link their Amazon Halo Band to their account to earn Vitality Points for the things they do to try to live longer, healthier lives. Learn more. “At John Hancock, we are committed to helping our customers live longer, healthier lives. We know Amazon shares this goal and are excited to integrate with Amazon Halo and continue to transform the role our industry plays in our customers’ lives,” said Brooks Tingle, President and CEO, John Hancock Insurance. “This strategic endeavor allows us to offer our customers the latest in insights-driven personal health technology that can help them improve their overall wellness. We believe these enhancements will have a positive impact for our customers.”

Amazon Halo is now integrated into Cerner solutions to enable consumers to easily share health information with their care teams and directly into their electronic health record (EHR). Amazon Halo members will be able to share their body fat percentage with participating care providers as well as activity and sleep data with Cerner Consumer Well-being programs. Sharp HealthCare is the first Cerner client to benefit from this collaboration. “For more than 40 years, Cerner has ushered in health care’s digital age by moving medical data from paper to electronic health records. Now we are seeking breakthrough innovation focused on making the health care experience more seamless and insightful,” said Brent Shafer, Chairman and CEO, Cerner. “Integrating the revolutionary body fat percentage measurement from Amazon Halo directly into the EHR provides physicians an actionable and previously hard to obtain health metric without the need for a doctor’s visit or costly technology. We believe our collaboration with Amazon Halo has the potential to improve the health of individuals and populations, reduce health care costs, and increase satisfaction for consumers and clinicians alike.”

Pricing, Availability, and Colors

Customers in the U.S. can request early access to Amazon Halo starting today. Through the early access period, Amazon Halo will be available for a special price of $64.99 including 6 months of Halo membership (regular price: $99.99). The membership automatically renews for $3.99 per month after the initial 6 months. The membership unlocks access to all Amazon Halo features; non-members will have access to the basics, including steps, sleep time, and heart rate.

Customers can choose from three color combinations for their Amazon Halo Band: a Black fabric band with an Onyx sensor capsule, a Blush fabric band with a Rose Gold sensor capsule, or a Winter fabric band with a Silver sensor capsule. Customers can purchase fabric accessory bands for the special early access price of $19.99 each.

47183,Philips to Acquire Intact Vascular for $360M,Philips to expand its image-guided therapy devices portfolio through acquisition of Intact Vascular,"Philips will acquire Intact Vascular for $275M up front and deferred payments of $85M upon completion of the transaction. The transaction is expected to be completed in Q3’20
 The collaboration will expand Philips’ image-guided therapy portfolio with the addition of Intact Vascular’s Tack endovascular system, that reinforces standard and drug-coated balloon PAD treatment results
 Intact Vascular’s Tack implant is a minimal-metal, dissection repair device that provides precision treatment of peripheral arterial dissections following balloon angioplasty in ATK and BTK therapeutic interventions","Amsterdam, the Netherlands – Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Intact Vascular, Inc., a U.S.-based developer of medical devices for minimally-invasive peripheral vascular procedures. Intact Vascular will enhance Philips’ image-guided therapy portfolio, combining Philips’ interventional imaging platform and diagnostic and therapeutic devices with Intact Vascular’s unique, specialized implantable device to optimize the treatment of patients with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD).
 

PAD develops when plaque builds up in arteries and reduces blood flow to the limbs, most commonly the legs. It affects more than 200 million people worldwide [1]. PAD symptoms include recurrent fatigue, leg pain, and foot or leg wounds that do not heal or heal very slowly. Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is an advanced stage of PAD, and is typically associated with high rates of amputation and mortality.

Acquiring Intact Vascular will expand our portfolio of minimally invasive therapy options for Peripheral Artery Disease with the Tack Endovascular System, a much needed implant that effectively restores blood flow in small limb vessels, promotes healing and preserves limbs.

Chris Landon

Senior Vice President and General Manager Image Guided Therapy Devices at Philips

“Acquiring Intact Vascular will expand our portfolio of minimally invasive therapy options for Peripheral Artery Disease with the Tack Endovascular System [2], a much needed implant that effectively restores blood flow in small limb vessels, promotes healing and preserves limbs,” said Chris Landon, Senior Vice President and General Manager Image Guided Therapy Devices at Philips. “Through the integration of our interventional imaging systems and diagnostic and therapeutic devices, we will be able to provide clinicians with a complete procedural solution to optimize the treatment of patients with this disease.”

 

Philips’ market leading peripheral vascular portfolio already includes advanced interventional imaging systems for precision guidance; intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheters to assess the location of the disease and lesion morphology and guide and confirm the treatment; peripheral atherectomy devices to remove blockages; and peripheral therapy devices, such as Philips’ Stellarex drug-coated balloon, to treat lesions. 

 

Intact Vascular will strengthen this portfolio with the Tack Endovascular System, which reinforces standard and drug-coated balloon PAD treatment results. Intact Vascular’s Tack [2] implant is a first-of-its-kind, minimal-metal, dissection repair device that provides precision treatment of peripheral arterial dissections following balloon angioplasty in above-the-knee (ATK) and below-the-knee (BTK) therapeutic interventions [3]. The Tack implant leaves less metal behind compared to stents, preserving future treatment options and ultimately preserving limbs. Moreover, Intact Vascular’s Tack implant offers a solution for repairing dissections and optimizing post-angioplasty outcomes in the challenging CLI patient population. 

 

“We are excited about the strategic fit between our team, expertise and unique therapeutic device, and Philips’ Image-Guided Therapy business,” said Bruce Shook, President and CEO of Intact Vascular. “We share the same vision of complete procedural solutions to improve existing procedures and expand treatment options. We look forward to completing the transaction and working closely with Philips on a seamless transition.”

 

The transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2020. Philips will acquire Intact Vascular for an upfront cash consideration of USD 275 million (approx. EUR 234 million), and deferred payments for which the company expects to recognize a provision of USD 85 million (approx. EUR 72 million) upon completion of the transaction.

 

Intact Vascular was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Wayne, Pennsylvania, in the U.S. On completion of the transaction, Intact Vascular will become part of Philips’ Image-Guided Therapy business.

The EMA cited GB0139’s clinically relevant biomarker data in IPF patients
Significant reduction of YKL-40 biomarker in fibrosis, inflammation, tissue remodeling diseases
BOSTON and COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Aug. 27, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Galecto, Inc., a privately-held biotechnology company focused on the development of novel treatments for fibrosis and cancer, today announced it has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) from both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for GB0139 in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).

The EMA cited clinically relevant biomarker data in IPF patients as a justification for the ODD designation, which provides financial incentives to encourage the development of drugs to treat rare diseases. In particular, GB0139 showed a significant reduction of the chitinase-like protein YKL-40, a serum biomarker in diseases with fibrosis, inflammation and tissue remodeling, as well as other biomarkers relevant to IPF in its first in human clinical study in IPF patients after 14 days of treatment. No changes in YKL-40 were reported in a study of patients being treated with the currently approved treatments pirfenidone and nintendanib, alone or in combination.

“We are very pleased that our promising GB0139 product candidate has received orphan drug designation in these two major markets, the U.S. and EU,” said Hans Schambye, CEO of Galecto. “In particular, we are very encouraged that the EMA has cited our data, showing a higher effect on IPF biomarkers than the currently approved treatments, as a clinically relevant advantage. Our Phase 2b study in IPF is progressing well, and we look forward to bringing GB0139 further through clinical trials and potentially to market to address a significant unmet medical need.”

GB0139 (formerly TD139) is an inhaled small molecule inhibitor of galectin-3, a protein known to play a central role in fibrosis in several organs. The company is investigating GB0139 in its Phase 2b GALACTIC-1 clinical trial in IPF. The trial is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study across more than 100 centers in the U.S., the EU and Canada, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GB0139 in 450 subjects with IPF.
