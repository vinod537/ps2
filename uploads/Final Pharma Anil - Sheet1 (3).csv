48676,Novo Nordisk's Sogroya (somapacitan-beco) Receives the US FDA Approval for Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency,FDA approves once-weekly Sogroya® for the treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency,"The approval is based on REAL 1 study assessing Sogroya (10 mg/ 1.5 mL (6.7 mg/mL) vs PBO for 35wks. in adults patients with growth hormone deficiency
 The US FDA ahs approved the BLA of the therapy for the replacement of endogenous growth hormone in adults with GHD
 Sogroya is a prescription medicine containing GH and is used to treat adults who do not make enough growth hormone. Efficacy and safety in children are not known","Plainsboro, NJ, Aug 28, 2020 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Biologics License Application for Sogroya® (somapacitan-beco) injection 10 mg/ 1.5 mL (6.7 mg/mL) for the replacement of endogenous growth hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Adults diagnosed with GHD do not produce sufficient growth hormone.

Sogroya® is a human growth hormone analog taken once a week by subcutaneous injection. The FDA’s decision is based on a comprehensive clinical program, including the REAL 1 study, a 35-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in treatment-naïve adult patients with GHD.

Novo Nordisk is currently finalizing plans for when Sogroya® can be made available.

About Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency

Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland. In adults, GHD can affect their bodies in many ways including changes in body composition, lipids, carbohydrate metabolism, bones, and muscle mass1. More than 50,000 adults in the United States have GHD, with about 6,000 new patients diagnosed each year2.

What is Sogroya®

Sogroya® (somapacitan-beco) injection 10 mg/1.5 mL (6.7 mg/mL) is a prescription medicine that contains human growth hormone, the same growth hormone made by the body and is used to treat adults who do not make enough growth hormone.

It is not known if Sogroya® is safe and effective in children.

48681,Cassiopea's Winlevi (Clascoterone Cream) Receives the US FDA's Approval for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris,"Cassiopea Receives FDA Approval for Winlevi® (clascoterone cream 1%), First-in-Class Topical Acne Treatment Targeting the Androgen Receptor","Winlevi is a first-in-class topical androgen receptor inhibitor approved by the US FDA for the treatment of acne in patients (age ≥12 yrs.) with a new mechanism of action (MOA) after ~ 40 yrs.
 Result: Winlevi demonstrated treatment success and reductions in acne lesions and was well tolerated when used q2w (in pivotal clinical trials). Additionally, the most frequently observed local skin reaction was mild erythema
 Winlevi (clascoterone cream 1%) is an androgen receptor inhibitor indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris by limiting sebum production and inflammation. It is expected to be available in the US in early 2021","LAINATE, Italy, Aug. 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Cassiopea SpA (SIX: SKIN) today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Winlevi® (clascoterone cream 1%) for the treatment of acne in patients 12 years and older. Notwithstanding acne being the most prevalent skin condition in the U.S. affecting up to 50 million Americans annually1, the last FDA approval of an acne drug with a new mechanism of action (MOA) occurred nearly 40 years ago.

Acne is a multifactorial skin condition, affected by four distinct pathways: excess oil (sebum) production, clogged pores (hyperkeratinization), bacteria growth (C. acnes), and inflammation2. Topical treatment options that target androgens, which largely drive sebum production and inflammation, presented a significant unmet need in the acne treatment market until now.

“The approval of WINLEVI is an exciting breakthrough in acne treatment. This game-changing topical drug offers a non-antibiotic approach to people with acne, by targeting the androgen receptors directly in the skin. It fills a longstanding gap in acne therapy,” said Michael Gold, M.D., Investigator and Medical Director, Gold Skin Care Center and Tennessee Clinical Research Center. “After 40 years, it provides a much-anticipated, complementary new approach to treat acne.”

Cassiopea’s first-in-class topical androgen receptor inhibitor, WINLEVI, tackles the androgen hormone component of acne in both males and females. Androgen receptor inhibitors act by limiting the effects of these hormones on increasing sebum production and inflammation3.

In pivotal clinical trials, WINLEVI demonstrated treatment success and reductions in acne lesions and was well tolerated when used twice a day. The most frequently observed local skin reaction was mild erythema4,5.

Diana Harbort, CEO of Cassiopea, said: “This milestone approval marks the introduction of a new class of topical medication in Dermatology. Dermatologists have said targeting androgen hormonal activity in the skin is ‘the holy grail’ of acne treatment for both males and females. We are proud to bring this new innovation to acne patients. This approval rewards many years of hard work and positions Cassiopea as a leader in Dermatology. Now we look forward to expanding our franchise and advancing our next investigational drug candidate for androgenetic alopecia.”

WINLEVI is expected to be available in the United States in early 2021. Complete prescribing information is available on www.WINLEVI.com.

About Winlevi® (clascoterone cream 1%):

Winlevi® (clascoterone cream 1%) is approved for the treatment of acne vulgaris in people aged 12 and older. Although WINLEVI’s exact mechanism of action is unknown, laboratory studies suggest the active ingredient, clascoterone, competes with androgens, specifically dihydrotestosterone (DHT), for binding to the androgen receptors within the sebaceous gland and hair follicles6.

Indication

Winlevi® (clascoterone cream 1%), is an androgen receptor inhibitor indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older.

Important Safety Information

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
None.

WARNINGS
Local Irritation: Pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling may be experienced with WINLEVI cream. If these effects occur, discontinue or reduce the frequency of application of WINLEVI cream.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression may occur during or after treatment with WINLEVI. In the PK trial, HPA axis suppression was observed in 1/20 (5%) of adult subjects and 2/22 (9%) of adolescent subjects at Day 14. All subjects returned to normal HPA axis function at follow-up 4 weeks after stopping treatment. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the use of occlusive dressings. Attempt to withdraw use if HPA axis suppression develops.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity.

Hyperkalemia: Elevated potassium levels were observed in some subjects during the clinical trials. Shifts from normal to elevated potassium levels were observed in 5% of WINLEVI-treated subjects and 4% of vehicle-treated subjects.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions occurring in 7 to 12% of patients are erythema/reddening, pruritus and scaling/dryness. Additionally, edema, stinging, and burning occurred in >3% of patients and were reported in a similar percentage of subjects treated with vehicle.

 Result: P-III study showed 40 % reduction in the IVCM total score across all corneal layers from baseline to 90 days and P-I/IIa study demonstrated a 30 % decrease in IVCM total score that was maintained for the 5 year study period
 Cystadrops (cysteamine ophthalmic solution) 0.37% is a cystine-depleting agent indicated for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal deposits in adults and children with cystinosis. It is the 1st and only FDA-approved cysteamine eye drop formulation","LEBANON, N.J., Aug. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Recordati Rare Diseases Inc., today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved CYSTADROPS® (cysteamine ophthalmic solution) 0.37%. CYSTADROPS is a new, viscous eye drop solution that depletes corneal cystine crystal deposits in people living with cystinosis. CYSTADROPS demonstrated a significant reduction in cystine crystal deposits in the cornea of the eye and is the first and only FDA-approved cysteamine drop formulation with four times a day dosing. Cystinosis is a rare genetic condition present from birth that leads to the build-up of cystine crystals throughout the body, causing widespread tissue and organ damage and significant impact on the eyes.

“Cystinosis is a complex disease and early detection and prompt treatment are critical in slowing the development and progression of symptoms. Improvements in the treatment of cystinosis in the last few decades has led to increased life expectancies. Despite these advances, eye manifestations of the disease are a continual struggle for patients,” said Clinton Moore, President, Cystinosis Research Network. “Cystinosis patients live with sensitivity to light, eye discomfort, and pain. They often wear sunglasses even when indoors and fight to keep up with daily activities like school and work.”

The FDA approval of CYSTADROPS was supported by data from two clinical trials, both in which patients received CYSTADROPS at a median frequency of four times per day. A Phase 3 open-label, randomized, controlled, two-arm multicenter trial, with 15 patients in the CYSTADROPS arm, investigated the reduction in corneal cystine crystal density as assessed by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). In the CYSTADROPS arm, the trial showed a 40 percent reduction in the IVCM total score across all corneal layers from baseline to 90 days.

A Phase 1/2a open-label, adaptive dose-response clinical trial of eight cystinosis patients showed that treatment with CYSTADROPS resulted in a 30 percent decrease in IVCM total score that was maintained for the five-year study period.

“People living with cystinosis and their caregivers have to manage multiple medications every day. To reduce their daily burden, Recordati worked to develop a new viscous eye drop formulation for treating corneal cystine crystals,” said Andrea Recordati, CEO. “We are pleased to bring Cystadrops® to patients in the U.S., the first FDA-approved cysteamine eye drop formulation that reduces corneal crystals with a practical four times a day dosing.”

The safety of CYSTADROPS was evaluated in two clinical trials. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were eye pain (stinging), blurred vision, eye irritation (burning), eye redness, discomfort at instillation site (sticky eyes or sticky eyelids), eye itching, watery eyes, and medicine deposit on the eye lashes or around the eyes.

About Cystinosis
Cystinosis is a rare genetic disorder affecting multiple organs and systems that most frequently begins in infancy. Cystinosis requires patients and caregivers to manage multiple different medications every day. It is estimated that approximately 600 people in the U.S. have cystinosis. Cystinosis is caused by a mutation in the cystinosin gene (CTNS) that impairs the transport of the amino acid cystine out of lysosomes in cells. This, in turn, results in formation and accumulation of cystine crystals in cells, causing damage to organs throughout the body and significant impact on the eyes.

The cornea, or front layer of the eye, is the part of the eye that may be most affected. The first and most frequently reported ocular symptom is photophobia — sensitivity to light that results in discomfort. It is thought that photophobia is mainly due to the presence of corneal cystine crystals that cause light entering the eye to scatter. As the disease progresses, ocular symptoms increase in number and intensity, daily activities become more difficult to carry out, and severe complications may develop, including visual impairment and potential corneal transplant.

 Result: Xaracoll provided statistically significant pain relief through 24 hrs. vs PBO, the primary endpoint for both studies. Median time in study 1 (11hrs. vs 1 hrs.) and in study 2 (6hrs. vs 1 hrs.)
 Xaracoll is a unique, non-injectable drug-device combination in the form of a fully bioresorbable collagen implant containing bupivacaine hydrochloride which is placed directly into the surgical site during surgery and, after placement, releases bupivacaine immediately and over time","ATHLONE, Ireland, Aug. 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Innocoll Holdings Limited, a specialty pharmaceutical company and portfolio business of Gurnet Point Capital, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Xaracoll®  for acute postsurgical pain relief for up to 24 hours in adults following open inguinal hernia repair, a painful and commonly-performed surgery.1

XARACOLL is a unique, non-injectable drug-device combination in the form of a fully bioresorbable collagen implant containing bupivacaine hydrochloride. XARACOLL is placed directly into the surgical site during surgery and, after placement, releases bupivacaine immediately and over time.1,2

“XARACOLL is an advancement in the management of postsurgical pain as it is the first and only drug-device combination product to provide local pain relief following open inguinal hernia repair in adults,” said Innocoll CEO Rich Fante. “The FDA approval is an important milestone for Innocoll and we are excited to bring XARACOLL to market later this year as an effective and well-tolerated, non-opioid treatment option for surgeons.”

The efficacy and safety of XARACOLL was evaluated in two Phase III studies of identical design in open inguinal hernia repair. The Phase III studies were performed as outpatient surgeries in adults across 39 sites (N=610, XARACOLL Arm N=404, Placebo Arm N=206) in the US. XARACOLL provided statistically significant pain relief through 24 hours versus placebo, the primary endpoint for both studies. The first secondary endpoint of total use of opioid analgesia through 24 hours was also statistically significant. Additionally, the proportion of patients who did not receive opioid rescue analgesia through 72 hours in the XARACOLL and placebo treatment groups was 36% and 22%, respectively, in Study 1, and 28% and 12%, respectively, in Study 2.  The median time to first opioid rescue analgesia in the XARACOLL and placebo treatment groups was 11 hours and 1 hour, respectively, in Study 1, and 6 hours and 1 hour, respectively in Study 2. The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (incidence ≥2% and higher than placebo) included incision site swelling, dysgeusia, headache, tremor, blurred vision, seroma, scrotal swelling, pyrexia, oral hypoesthesia, and post procedural discharge.1,3

“In Phase III studies XARACOLL was shown to provide local pain relief in patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair while also decreasing the amount of opioids needed,” said Wendy Niebler DO, MBA, Chief Medical Officer at Innocoll. “We look forward to sharing our Phase III data with surgeons as we introduce this new option to manage acute pain following open inguinal hernia repair in adults.”

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

XARACOLL contains an amide local anesthetic and is indicated in adults for placement into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia for up to 24 hours following open inguinal hernia repair.

Limitations of Use

Safety and effectiveness have not been established in other surgical procedures, including orthopedic and boney procedures.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

XARACOLL is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to bupvicaine or to any local anesthetic of the amide type or other components of XARACOLL, in addition to use in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. Cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and consciousness should monitored after placement of XARACOLL, especially in patients with hepatic impairment. Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with use of local anesthetics. Additional anesthetic administration should be avoided within 96 hours following XARACOLL implantation. Local anesthetics may cause fetal harm based on animal data.

48692,GSK's Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) Receives the US FDA's Approval as a Monotherapy Treatment for Multiple Myeloma,FDA approves GSK’s BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma,"The approval is based on a pivotal study, DREAMM-2 assessing Blenrep (2.5 mg/kg, q3w) in 218 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had actively progressing disease that had worsened despite current SoC
 Results: Blenrep demonstrated an ORR (31%), DoR not reached at the 6-mos. analysis, but 73% of responders had a DoR ≥ 6 mos. Continued approval for this indication depends upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials
 Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) is an antibody drug conjugate comprising a humanised anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F. Blenrep is the 1st anti-BCMA therapy approved globally and 5th major medicine approval for GSK in 2020","GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. BLENREP is the first anti-BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) therapy approved anywhere in the world.[i]

Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “As the second most common form of blood cancer in the US, multiple myeloma is an incurable and devastating disease. BLENREP is the first approved anti-BCMA therapy and has the potential to transform the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who have limited treatment options today.’’

BLENREP is GSK’s fifth major medicine approval in 2020 across areas of significant unmet medical need such as cancer, HIV and chronic kidney disease. This approval marks the second FDA approval for GSK’s oncology portfolio in four months.

BLENREP employs a multi-faceted mechanism of action and is directed toward BCMA, a cell-surface protein that plays an important role in the survival of plasma cells and is expressed on multiple myeloma cells.[ii] The approval of BLENREP was based on six-month primary results from the pivotal DREAMM-2 study, which enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had actively progressing disease that had worsened despite current standard of care.

Dr Sagar Lonial, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, Chair of Emory Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology and Principal Investigator for DREAMM-2, said: “While treatable, refractory multiple myeloma is a significant clinical challenge with poor outcomes for patients whose disease has become resistant to the current standard of care. Due to the limited options currently available, these patients are often retreated with drugs from the same classes after they relapse, which is why the approval of BLENREP, the first anti-BCMA therapy, is significant for both patients and physicians alike.”

In the DREAMM-2 study, treatment with single-agent BLENREP 2.5 mg/kg every three weeks demonstrated a clinically meaningful overall response rate (ORR) of 31% (97.5% CI; 21-43) in patients who had received a median of seven prior lines of treatment (n=97). The median duration of response (DoR) had not been reached at the six-month analysis, but 73% of responders had a DoR equal to or greater than six months. The most commonly reported adverse events (≥20%) were keratopathy, decreased visual acuity, nausea, blurred vision, pyrexia, infusion-related reactions, and fatigue. Keratopathy is characterised as changes in the corneal epithelium as seen on eye examination, which can manifest with or without symptoms.

Ocular adverse reactions occurred in 77% of the 218 patients in the pooled safety population and included keratopathy (76%), changes in visual acuity (55%), blurred vision (27%) and dry eye (19%). Corneal adverse events were monitored with eye exams prior to each dose, allowing for dose reductions or interruptions as appropriate. Patients also used preservative-free eye drops. Keratopathy leading to treatment discontinuation affected 2.1% of patients in the 2.5 mg/kg cohort.[iii]

BLENREP is available through participation in the BLENREP Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which was developed to ensure appropriate use of the medicine. The programme requires education for all physicians prescribing BLENREP and their patients regarding the ocular risks associated with treatment as well as monitoring. Additional information about the BLENREP REMS can be found at www.blenreprems.com or 1-855-209-9188.

Paul Giusti, President and CEO of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF), said: “The approval of BLENREP is an important advancement for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, as it brings a much-needed new treatment to patients who face limited options due to their progressing disease. We are grateful for GSK’s continued commitment to myeloma patients and their families.”

In 2017, BLENREP was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, which is intended to facilitate the development of investigational medicines that have shown clinical promise for conditions where there is significant unmet need.

About multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer in the US and is generally considered treatable, but not curable.[iv] In the US, more than 32,000 people are estimated to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma this year and nearly 13,000 people will die from the disease.[v] Research into new therapies is needed as multiple myeloma commonly becomes refractory to available treatments.[vi]

About B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)
The normal function of BCMA is to promote plasma cell survival by transduction of signals from two known ligands, BAFF (B-cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand). This pathway has been shown to be important for myeloma cell growth and survival. BCMA expression is limited to B cells at later stages of development. BCMA is expressed at varying levels in myeloma patients and BCMA membrane expression is universally detected in myeloma cell lines.iii

About BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf)
BLENREP is an antibody drug conjugate comprising a humanised anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F via non-cleavable linker. The drug linker technology is licensed from Seattle Genetics; monoclonal antibody is produced using POTELLIGENT Technology licensed from BioWa.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR BLENREP

WARNING: OCULAR Toxicity
BLENREP caused changes in the corneal epithelium resulting in changes in vision, including severe vision loss and corneal ulcer, and symptoms such as blurred vision and dry eyes.

Conduct ophthalmic exams at baseline, prior to each dose, and promptly for worsening symptoms. Withhold BLENREP until improvement and resume, or permanently discontinue, based on severity.

Because of the risk of ocular toxicity, BLENREP is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the BLENREP REMS.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Ocular Toxicity: Ocular adverse reactions occurred in 77% of the 218 patients in the pooled safety population. Ocular adverse reactions included keratopathy (76%), changes in visual acuity (55%), blurred vision (27%), and dry eye (19%). Among patients with keratopathy (n = 165), 49% had ocular symptoms, 65% had clinically relevant visual acuity changes (decline of 2 or more lines on Snellen Visual Acuity in any eye), and 34% had both ocular symptoms and visual acuity changes.

Keratopathy: Keratopathy was reported as Grade 1 in 7% of patients, Grade 2 in 22%, Grade 3 in 45%, and Grade 4 in 0.5% per the KVA scale. Cases of corneal ulcer (ulcerative and infective keratitis) have been reported. Most keratopathy events developed within the first 2 treatment cycles (cumulative incidence of 65% by Cycle 2). Of the patients with Grade 2 to 4 keratopathy (n = 149), 39% recovered to Grade 1 or lower after median follow-up of 6.2 months. Of the 61% who had ongoing keratopathy, 28% were still on treatment, 9% were in follow-up, and in 24% the follow-up ended due to death, study withdrawal, or lost to follow-up. For patients in whom events resolved, the median time to resolution was 2 months (range: 11 days to 8.3 months).

Visual Acuity Changes: A clinically significant decrease in visual acuity of worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye was observed in 19% of the 218 patients and of 20/200 or worse in the better-seeing eye in 1.4%. Of the patients with decreased visual acuity of worse than 20/40, 88% resolved and the median time to resolution was 22 days (range: 7 days to 4.2 months). Of the patients with decreased visual acuity of 20/200 or worse, all resolved and the median duration was 22 days (range: 15 to 22 days).

Monitoring and Patient Instruction: Conduct ophthalmic examinations (visual acuity and slit lamp) at baseline, prior to each dose, and promptly for worsening symptoms. Perform baseline examinations within 3 weeks prior to the first dose. Perform each follow-up examination at least 1 week after the previous dose and within 2 weeks prior to the next dose. Withhold BLENREP until improvement and resume at same or reduced dose, or consider permanently discontinuing based on severity. Advise patients to use preservative-free lubricant eye drops at least 4 times a day starting with the first infusion and continuing until end of treatment. Avoid use of contact lenses unless directed by an ophthalmologist. Changes in visual acuity may be associated with difficulty for driving and reading. Advise patients to use caution when driving or operating machinery. BLENREP is only available through a restricted program under a REMS.

BLENREP REMS: BLENREP is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the BLENREP REMS because of the risks of ocular toxicity. Notable requirements of the BLENREP REMS include the following:

Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training in the BLENREP REMS.
Prescribers must counsel patients receiving BLENREP about the risk of ocular toxicity and the need for ophthalmic examinations prior to each dose.
Patients must be enrolled in the BLENREP REMS and comply with monitoring.
Healthcare facilities must be certified with the program and verify that patients are authorized to receive BLENREP.
Wholesalers and distributers must only distribute BLENREP to certified healthcare facilities.
Further information is available at www.BLENREPREMS.com and 1-855-209-9188.

Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia occurred in 69% of 218 patients in the pooled safety population, including Grade 2 in 13%, Grade 3 in 10%, and Grade 4 in 17%. The median time to onset of the first thrombocytopenic event was 26.5 days. Thrombocytopenia resulted in dose reduction, dose interruption, or discontinuation in 9%, 2.8%, and 0.5% of patients, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 bleeding events occurred in 6% of patients, including Grade 4 in 1 patient. Fatal adverse reactions included cerebral hemorrhage in 2 patients. Perform complete blood cell counts at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Consider withholding and/or reducing the dose based on severity.

Infusion-Related Reactions: Infusion-related reactions occurred in 18% of 218 patients in the pooled safety population, including Grade 3 in 1.8%. Monitor patients for infusion-related reactions. For Grade 2 or 3 reactions, interrupt the infusion and provide supportive treatment. Once symptoms resolve, resume at a lower infusion rate. Administer premedication for all subsequent infusions. Discontinue BLENREP for life-threatening infusion-related reactions and provide appropriate emergency care.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action, BLENREP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it contains a genotoxic compound (the microtubule inhibitor, monomethyl auristatin F [MMAF]) and it targets actively dividing cells. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BLENREP and for 4 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BLENREP and for 6 months after the last dose.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
The pooled safety population described in Warnings and Precautions reflects exposure to BLENREP at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg (1.4 times the recommended dose) administered intravenously once every 3 weeks in 218 patients in DREAMM-2. Of these patients, 194 received a liquid formulation (not the approved dosage form) rather than the lyophilized powder. Among the 218 patients, 24% were exposed for 6 months or longer.

The safety of BLENREP as a single agent was evaluated in DREAMM-2. Patients received BLENREP at the recommended dosage of 2.5 mg/kg administered intravenously once every 3 weeks (n = 95). Among these patients, 22% were exposed for 6 months or longer.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of patients who received BLENREP. Serious adverse reactions in >3% of patients included pneumonia (7%), pyrexia (6%), renal impairment (4.2%), sepsis (4.2%), hypercalcemia (4.2%), and infusion-related reactions (3.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.2% of patients, including sepsis (1%), cardiac arrest (1%), and lung infection (1%).

Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 8% of patients who received BLENREP; keratopathy (2.1%) was the most frequent adverse reaction resulting in permanent discontinuation.

Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 54% of patients who received BLENREP. Adverse reactions which required a dosage interruption in >3% of patients included keratopathy (47%), blurred vision (5%), dry eye (3.2%), and pneumonia (3.2%).

Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 29% of patients. Adverse reactions which required a dose reduction in >3% of patients included keratopathy (23%) and thrombocytopenia (5%).

The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were keratopathy (71%), decreased visual acuity (53%), nausea (24%), blurred vision (22%), pyrexia (22%), infusion-related reactions (21%), and fatigue (20%). The most common Grade 3 or 4 (≥5%) laboratory abnormalities were lymphocytes decreased (22%), platelets decreased (21%), hemoglobin decreased (18%), neutrophils decreased (9%), creatinine increased (5%), and gamma-glutamyl transferase increased (5%).

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Lactation: There is no data on the presence of belantamab mafodotin-blmf in human milk or the effects on the breastfed child or milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with BLENREP and for 3 months after the last dose.

Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: BLENREP can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no available data on the use of BLENREP in pregnant women to evaluate for drug-associated risk. No animal reproduction studies were conducted with BLENREP.

Pregnancy Testing: Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating BLENREP.

Infertility: Based on findings in animal studies, BLENREP may impair fertility in females and males. The effects were not reversible in male rats but were reversible in female rats.

Geriatric Use: Of the 218 patients who received BLENREP in DREAMM-2, 43% were aged 65 to less than 75 years and 17% were aged 75 years and older. Keratopathy occurred in 80% of patients aged less than 65 years and 73% of patients aged 65 years and older. Among the patients who received BLENREP at the 2.5-mg/kg dose in DREAMM-2 (n = 95), keratopathy occurred in 67% of patients aged less than 65 years and 73% of patients aged 65 years and older.

Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2 as estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation). The recommended dosage has not been established in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 not on dialysis or requiring dialysis.

Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤upper limit of normal [ULN] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >ULN or total bilirubin 1 to ≤1.5 × ULN and any AST). The recommended dosage of BLENREP has not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN and any AST).

INDICATION
BLENREP is indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least 4 prior therapies, including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor, and an immunomodulatory agent.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

48743,AstraZeneca Acquires Dogma Therapeutics' Oral PCSK9 Inhibitor Program,Dogma Therapeutics Announces Global Acquisition of Oral PCSK9 Inhibitor Program by AstraZeneca,"Dogma to receive upfront along with global regulatory and commercial milestones. AstraZeneca to get the rights to an orally active drug inhibiting PCSK9, offering a patient-friendly alternative to current cholesterol-lowering therapies that are delivered via a needle
 The agreement allows the AstraZeneca to develop the first small molecule, orally bioavailable PCSK9 inhibitor for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease
 PCSK9 is considered the exemplary target accredited by human genetics, as variants found in humans establish the needed directionality of a therapeutic","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Dogma Therapeutics (“Dogma“) has reached an agreement for the acquisition of its oral PCSK9 program by AstraZeneca.  Dogma will receive upfront as well as downstream payments linked to global regulatory and commercial milestones.

The pursuit of a convenient, oral PCSK9-based therapy has been the singular focus of Dogma scientists for nearly a decade.  PCSK9 is widely considered the exemplary target accredited by human genetics, as variants found in humans establish the needed directionality of a therapeutic.  Both from a patient convenience standpoint and the potential for combination therapy, there is a need for widely-accessible oral therapies for the millions of people at risk for cardiovascular events.

Through a series of comprehensive hit-finding and validation efforts, the Dogma team discovered small molecules that directly bind to a novel binding pocket in PCSK9.  Dozens of high-resolution x-ray structures of Dogma inhibitors bound to PCSK9 allowed rapid optimization to picomolar affinity with exquisite physicochemical attributes and robust LDL-C lowering when dosed orally in preclinical models of hypercholesterolemia.

“We have built a robust data package that highlights the cholesterol-lowering and safety potential of our oral PCSK9 program,” noted Dogma CEO Brian Hubbard, Ph.D.  “This agreement with AstraZeneca meets our strategic goal to accelerate access to patients unable to meet target LDL-C.  I would like to especially thank our scientific partners – Charles River Laboratories, Viva Biotech, Anji Pharmaceuticals, and our CRO partners – for their commitment to this project and their world-class problem solving.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca said: “Raised LDL cholesterol is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is estimated to cause 2.6 million deaths worldwide every year. Whilst PCSK9 is a well validated target for lowering LDL cholesterol it has been a hugely challenging target to inhibit with small molecules. This agreement with Dogma Therapeutics offers us the opportunity to develop the first small molecule, orally bioavailable PCSK9 inhibitor, for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease.”

Since inception, Dogma has developed a highly collaborative research model that leverages scientific expertise across the globe. This collaborative model was first created with Charles River, a leading, full-service drug discovery and early-stage development company, who, with its global, integrated drug discovery and safety assessment platform, has worked on 85% of drugs approved by the FDA in 2019. In tackling this previously considered ‘small molecule undruggable’ target, Charles River scientists and project leads contributed medicinal and computational chemistry, structural biology, biophysics, cell biology, ADME, and PK/PD expertise. “Charles River has played an integral role in the launch and progression of Dogma with their compelling drug discovery expertise and knowledge,” noted Hubbard.

“Our team is extremely proud to have worked closely with Dogma throughout the development of its oral PCSK9 inhibitor program,” said Birgit Girshick, Executive Vice President, Discovery & Safety Assessment at Charles River. “This ground-breaking project could prove transformational in the management of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease.”

Another key partner, Viva Biotech, is a leading structure-based, integrated drug discovery platform company. Viva has a full spectrum of early-stage drug discovery technologies from hit identification to development candidate nomination, combined with a unique equity-for-service (EFS) model. Viva has incubated more than 50 startup biotech companies similar to Dogma and plans to work with 100 more in the next 2 years.

“It was an exceptionally rewarding experience for our team to have a close partnership with Dogma during the exciting discovery phase,” said Dr. Zhixiong Ye, Chief Scientific Officer at Viva Biotech. “An orally-bioavailable small molecule PCSK9 inhibitor will greatly impact the unmet medical needs of cardiovascular patients.”

In addition to Viva’s equity-for-service investment, Dogma received support from a syndicate of cross-border investors and corporate collaborators including JMCR Partners, CR Capital, and Anji Pharmaceuticals.

The Foley Hoag LLP team of Hemmie Chang, Adrienne Ellman, David Halstead, Nicola Lemay, Kathryn Lumb, Laura Trumbull, Yuliya Kozachenko, Chasse Osborn and Kyrsten Lundh represented Dogma.

The test  targets antibodies against the spike protein. This is the focus of vaccines in development and convalescent plasma therapy.1
Using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-COV-2 S antibody test, together with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2* test launched in May, can help to more effectively determine the percentage of a population who already have antibodies against SARS-COV-2.

Basel, 18 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the launch of its Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody test for markets accepting the CE Mark. Roche has filed for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology test can be used to quantitatively measure antibodies in people who have been exposed to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can play an important part in characterising a vaccine-induced immune response.1 Specifically, the test targets antibodies which are directed against the particular region of the viral spike protein responsible for binding to the host cell receptor, which is required for the virus to enter the host cell. The majority of current candidate vaccines aim to induce an antibody response against the spike protein.

“As the possibility of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes a reality, quantitative measurement of antibodies will be crucial in the evaluation of any potential vaccine. The new quantitative Elecsys antibody test can play a pivotal role in vaccine clinical trials as well as helping clinicians assess patients immune response.This will be instrumental in protecting people most vulnerable to the virus, as well as in overcoming COVID-19 for society in general.” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “This new test, the twelfth in the Roche SARS-CoV-2 testing portfolio, is another essential addition to support healthcare systems and patients as we jointly fight COVID-19.”

Before a vaccine is administered it is important to know the starting level of antibodies a person has, in order to evaluate any change in antibody levels that the vaccine induces, especially the development of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These antibodies have been shown to have potent antiviral activity and correlate to potential immunity.2 Measuring antibody levels could also be vital in establishing vaccine efficacy in the prevention of infection and/or the development of severe COVID-19.1

Alongside its importance to vaccine design and efficacy evaluations, the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S serology test can be used to determine antibody levels in plasmapheresis donations. Performing a combination of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 tests can also help to more effectively define what percentage of a given population has developed antibodies (seroprevalence) against SARS-COV-2, especially in low to moderate seroprevalence settings.3 Knowing a given population’s seroprevalence is important in understanding how to contain the spread of the virus, as well as how to safely ease lockdown restrictions.

The test is the latest addition to the comprehensive Roche diagnostic portfolio to help healthcare systems combat COVID-19 through testing in the laboratory and at the point of care. Currently, this portfolio includes molecular, serology and digital solutions which help diagnose and manage COVID-19 during the initial stages of infection, during the recovery phase, as well as following the resolution of infection.

About SARS-CoV-2
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain which has not previously been identified in humans.

Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and fever. In more severe cases, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death can occur.4

About potential SARS-COV-2 vaccines
As of 3 September  2020, 47 candidate vaccines are in clinical evaluation and 3 vaccines have been approved for early or limited use, while at least 91 preclinical vaccines are under active investigation.1,5 All candidate vaccines in Phase III or approved for limited / early use aim to induce an antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Any potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 would work (amongst other mechanisms) by triggering the immune response to develop neutralising antibodies, in the person receiving the vaccine. In doing so, the vaccine trains the body’s immune system to recognize and fight an exposure to SARS-CoV-2, in a controlled way, without being exposed to the actual virus.1

About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology tests
The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S is an immunoassay for the quantitative, in vitro determination of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma. Through a blood sample, the test can measure the quantity of antibodies to the spike protein of the coronavirus, which could signal whether a person has been already infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. This can also be used to determine antibody levels in plasmapheresis donations. Plasmapheresis is a procedure which separates and removes the plasma from a patient’s blood. This plasma is then replaced with plasma from a donor.  It is assumed that plasma from a donor who has already had SARS-CoV-2 will have direct antiviral properties for the donor recipient.6 This is being explored as an adjunctive treatment for the management of COVID-19.6 The test has both a high clinical specificity of 99.98% (N=5991) and sensitivity of 98.8% (N=1423), 14 days or later after diagnosis with PCR. Additionally, across panels of potentially cross-reactive samples (N=1100) from endemic human coronaviruses, infectious respiratory diseases, other infectious diseases, auto-immune and liver related diseases, the test demonstrated zero cross-reactivity.

Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analyzers which are widely available around the world. These fully-automated systems can provide SARS-CoV-2 test results in approximately 18 minutes, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyzer.3

*The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the qualitative, in vitro detection of antibodies (including IgG) to SARS-CoV-2. The test can detect antibodies to the coronavirus, which could signal whether a person has been already infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. This test can also help in the determination of seroprevalence (i.e. the frequency of individuals with antibody to the virus), in a given population, as well as a complement test to Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The test runs on Roche’s cobas e analyzers which are widely available around the world.3

About Roche response to COVID-19 section
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with varying developments from country to country and we are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients receive the tests, treatment and care they need. This new test is an additional step in Roche’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already included:

Launching COVID-19 diagnostic tests for active infection and the detection of antibodies in patients who have been exposed to the virus,
Investigating treatments from our existing portfolio to better understand their potential to treat patients with COVID-19,
Increasing manufacturing and supply chain capacity to meet product demand across our portfolio within the wider context of COVID-19 treatment,
Ensuring the supply of our existing medicines and diagnostics to patients around the world under exceptional conditions.
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 13 March we received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Also in June we received an FDA EUA for the Elecsys® IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as launching Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic. In July, we added a Rapid Antibody Test, with SD Biosensor as distribution partner, to our portfolio, that allows the detection of antibodies against Covid-19 at the point of care. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are researching options for the future. Roche has an ongoing clinical trial program evaluating the role of Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) in COVID-19 pneumonia. On 29 July we announced that the COVACTA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient mortality. The study was the first global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial investigating Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Roche remains committed to continuing the Actemra/RoActemra clinical trial programme in COVID-19 to further explore Actemra/RoActemra in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral. In addition to COVACTA, Roche has initiated several studies to further investigate Actemra/RoActemra as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including two phase III clinical trials, REMDACTA and EMPACTA, as well as the phase II MARIPOSA trial. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations. On 19 August, we announced a partnership with Regeneron to develop, manufacture and distribute REGN-COV2, Regeneron’s investigational antiviral antibody combination, to people around the globe.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

48769,AstraZeneca and MSD Report Five Year Data of Lynparza in P-III SOLO-1 Study for 1L Maintenance Treatment in Patients with BRCA-Mutated Ovarian Cancer,Lynparza improved median time patients lived without disease progression to over four and half years in BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer vs. just over one year with placebo,"The P-III SOLO-1 study involves assessing of Lynparza (300mg, bid) as a maintenance monothx. vs PBO in 391 patients in a ratio (2:1) with newly diagnosed BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer following 1L Pt.-based CT for ~2yrs. or until disease progression
 Five-year follow-up data demonstrated a 67% reduction in risk of disease progression or death, improvement in PFS (56 vs 13.8mos.), patients remained free from disease progression (48.3% vs 20.5%), the median duration of treatment (24.6 vs 13.9mos.), presented at ESMO 2020
 The P-III SOLO-1 met its 1EPs of PFS in Jun’2018, which formed the basis of approvals in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and other countries. Lynparza is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor acts by targeting DDR in cells/tumors harboring a deficiency in HRR (BRCA1& 2 mutation)","18 September 2020 08:00 BST
Five-year data from the SOLO-1 Phase III trial is the longest follow-up
analysis for any PARP inhibitor in the 1st-line maintenance setting
AstraZeneca and MSD’s Lynparza (olaparib) demonstrated a long-term progression-free survival (PFS) benefit versus placebo as a 1st-line maintenance treatment in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) ovarian cancer who had a complete or partial response following platinum-based chemotherapy.

Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer death in women worldwide and in 2018, there were nearly 300,000 new patients diagnosed and around 185,000 deaths globally.1 Approximately 22% of patients with ovarian cancer have a BRCA1/2 mutation.2

Five-year follow-up data from the SOLO-1 Phase III trial showed Lynparza reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 67% (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.43) and improved PFS to a median of 56.0 months versus 13.8 months for placebo. At five years, 48.3% of patients treated with Lynparza remained free from disease progression versus 20.5% on placebo. The median duration of treatment with Lynparza was 24.6 months versus 13.9 months with placebo.

Susana Banerjee, one of the investigators from the SOLO-1 trial and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and Reader at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: “For patients with newly-diagnosed BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer, the benefit derived from two years of maintenance treatment with Lynparza continued long after treatment ended. After five years, almost half of women were free of cancer progression. These results represent a significant step forward in the treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Once a patient’s ovarian cancer recurs, it historically has been incurable. Even at an advanced stage, we have shown that maintenance treatment with Lynparza can help patients achieve sustained remission. Today’s results further underline the critical importance of identifying a patient’s biomarker status at the time of diagnosis to offer a treatment that may help delay disease progression.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “This is the first trial of a PARP inhibitor to read out a five year follow up and showed Lynparza improved progression-free survival to over four and half years versus 13.8 months with placebo following response to 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy. This latest data represents a major and significant milestone in a disease which has historically had such a poor prognosis.”
Summary of results

summary of results
The safety profile of Lynparza was consistent with previous observations. The most common adverse events (AEs) ≥20% were nausea (77%), fatigue/asthenia (63%), vomiting (40%), anaemia (39%) and diarrhoea (34%). The most common ≥ grade 3 AEs were anaemia (22%) and neutropenia (9%). 12% of patients on Lynparza discontinued treatment due to an AE.

The results were presented on Friday 18 September during the 2020 European Society of Medical Oncology virtual congress.

The SOLO-1 Phase III trial met the primary endpoint of PFS in June 2018, which formed the basis of approvals in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries.

Ovarian cancer

For newly diagnosed patients with advanced ovarian cancer, the primary aim of first-line treatment is to delay progression of the disease for as long as possible and maintain the patient’s quality of life with the intent of achieving complete remission.3-6

About SOLO-1

SOLO-1 was a Phase III, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lynparza tablets (300mg twice daily) as a maintenance monotherapy compared with placebo in patients with newly-diagnosed BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The trial randomised 391 patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation who were in clinical complete or partial response following platinum-based chemotherapy.

Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive Lynparza or placebo for up to two years or until disease progression. Patients who had a partial response at two years were permitted to stay on therapy at the investigator’s discretion. The primary endpoint was PFS and key secondary endpoints included time to second disease progression or death, time to first subsequent treatment and overall survival.

Lynparza

Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.

Lynparza is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for patients with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive advanced ovarian cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. It is also approved in the US and several other countries for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US for HRR gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in several countries for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.

The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration 

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and Koselugo (selumetinib), a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

AstraZeneca in oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

There was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra/RoActemra or placebo
Roche plans to share these results with health authorities, including the US FDA

Basel, 18 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the phase III EMPACTA study met its primary endpoint, showing that patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia who received Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) plus standard of care were 44% less likely to progress to mechanical ventilation or death compared to patients who received placebo plus standard of care (log-rank p-value = 0.0348; HR [95% CI] = 0.56 [0.32, 0.97]). The cumulative proportion of patients who progressed to mechanical ventilation or death by day 28 was 12.2% in the Actemra/RoActemra arm versus 19.3% in the placebo arm. The EMPACTA study did not identify any new safety signals for Actemra/RoActemra.

“The EMPACTA trial demonstrated that Actemra/RoActemra can reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, an important outcome in this serious disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We plan to share this important data with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health authorities around the world.”

The study is the first global, phase III COVID-19 clinical trial to primarily enrol patient populations that are often underrepresented in clinical studies and have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 85% of the 389 patients were from minority racial and ethnic groups. The majority of patients were Hispanic, with significant representation of Native American and Black populations. The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Kenya, Brazil, Mexico and Peru.

“We have been striving to improve inclusion and diversity in our trials,” said Jamie Freedman, M.D., Ph.D., Head of U.S. Medical Affairs. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw how high the stakes were for many communities of colour and made diversity the centerpiece of this trial.”

The EMPACTA trial builds on Roche’s work in Advancing Inclusive Research, a cross-organisational US initiative to help address barriers in clinical research for underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.

Summary of Key EMPACTA Clinical and Safety Findings

Primary endpoint was met: patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia who received Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care were 44% less likely to progress to mechanical ventilation or death compared to patients who received placebo plus standard of care (log-rank p-value = 0.0348; HR [95% CI] = 0.56 [0.32, 0.97]). The cumulative proportion of patients who progressed to mechanical ventilation or death by day 28 was 12.2% in the Actemra/RoActemra arm versus 19.3% in the placebo arm.
Key secondary endpoints
The difference in time to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge” to day 28 was not significant (median (days): Actemra = 6; placebo (PBO) = 7.5; log-rank p-value = 0.2456; HR [95% CI] = 1.16 [0.90, 1.48])
The difference in time to improvement in ordinal clinical status to day 28 was not significant (median (days): Actemra = 6; PBO = 7; log-rank p-value = 0.2597; HR  [95% CI] = 1.15 [0.90, 1.47])
Time to clinical failure to day 28 was longer in the Actemra arm compared to the placebo arm (median (days): Actemra = not-estimable (NE); PBO = NE; log-rank p = 0.0217; HR [95% CI] = 0.55 [0.33, 0.92]). However, the difference cannot be considered statistically significant as other key secondary endpoints were not met.
There was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra or placebo by day 28 (Actemra = 10.4%; PBO = 8.6%, p-value = 0.5146, Difference [95% CI]: 2.0% [-5.2%, 7.8%].
At day 28, incidence of infections was 10% and 11% in the Actemra/RoActemra and placebo arms, respectively, and the incidence of serious infections was 5.0% and 6.3% in the Actemra/RoActemra and placebo arms, respectively. The most common adverse events in patients who received Actemra/RoActemra were constipation (5.6%), anxiety (5.2%), and headache (3.2%). The EMPACTA study did not identify any new safety signals for Actemra/RoActemra.
Results from the EMPACTA trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Actemra/RoActemra is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including in combination with an antiviral in the phase III REMDACTA clinical trial. Results from the phase III COVACTA trial in patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia were released in July. In addition, there are a number of independent trials of Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Actemra/RoActemra has not been approved by any health authority for COVID-19 associated pneumonia.

About the EMPACTA Trial
EMPACTA (Evaluating Minority Patients with Actemra) is a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study (EMPACTA, NCT04372186) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Actemra in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 associated pneumonia among patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials.

The trial enrolled hospitalised patients older than 18 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection with SpO2 <94% while on ambient air who did not require noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint is the cumulative proportion of participants dying or requiring mechanical ventilation by Day 28. Secondary objectives include: time to clinical failure, defined as the time to death, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, or withdrawal (whichever occurs first); mortality rate by Day 28; and time to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge.”

The study enrolled 389 patients in the United States, South Africa, Kenya, Brazil, Mexico and Peru.

About the REMDACTA Trial
REMDACTA is a two-armed global phase III, randomised, double-blind, multi-centre study (REMDACTA, NCT04409262) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Actemra/RoActemra plus remdesivir, versus placebo plus remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia receiving standard of care. The REMDACTA trial is being conducted in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. The primary endpoint of the study is clinical status as measured by a 7-Category Ordinal Scale by Day 28. Key secondary endpoints include mortality, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care variables. Patients will be followed for 60 days post-randomisation.

About Actemra/RoActemra
Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved anti-IL-6 receptor biologic available in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Actemra/RoActemra can be used alone or with methotrexate (MTX) in adult RA patients who are intolerant to, or have failed to respond to, other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In Europe, RoActemra IV and SC are also approved for use in adult patients with severe, active and progressive RA who previously have not been treated with MTX. Actemra/RoActemra IV and SC are approved globally for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and in the US and Europe for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in children two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra SC injection is also the first approved therapy for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) in more than 40 countries, including the US and Europe. In the US and Europe, Actemra/RoActemra IV injection is approved for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in people two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved treatment for CRS in this setting. A prefilled auto-injector ACTPen has been approved in the US and Europe. In Japan, Actemra is also approved for the treatment of Castleman’s disease, adult Still’s disease and Takayasu arteritis, in addition to the above mentioned indications. Actemra/RoActemra is part of a co-development agreement with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd and has been approved in Japan since April 2005. Actemra/RoActemra is approved in more than 110 countries worldwide.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with varying developments from country to country and we are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients receive the tests, treatment and care they need. This new test is an additional step in Roche’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already included:

Launching COVID-19 diagnostic tests for active infection and the detection of antibodies in patients who have been exposed to the virus,
Investigating treatments from our existing portfolio to better understand their potential to treat patients with COVID-19,
Increasing manufacturing and supply chain capacity to meet product demand across our portfolio within the wider context of COVID-19 treatment, and
Ensuring the supply of our existing medicines and diagnostics to patients around the world under exceptional conditions.
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 13 March we received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Also in June we received an FDA EUA for the Elecsys® IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as launching Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic. In July, we added a Rapid Antibody Test, with SD Biosensor as distribution partner, to our portfolio, that allows the detection of antibodies against Covid-19 at the point of care. On 1 September we announced that we will launch a SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test, in late September, for markets accepting the CE Mark. We also intend to file for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test is for use in point of care settings for both symptomatic and asymptomatic people. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are researching options for the future. Roche has an ongoing clinical trial program evaluating the role of Actemra/RoActemra (tocilizumab) in COVID-19 pneumonia. On 29 July we announced that the COVACTA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient mortality. The study was the first global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial investigating Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Roche remains committed to continuing the Actemra/RoActemra clinical trial programme in COVID-19 to further explore Actemra/RoActemra in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral. In addition to COVACTA, Roche has initiated several studies to further investigate Actemra/RoActemra as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including two phase III clinical trials, REMDACTA and EMPACTA, as well as the phase II MARIPOSA trial. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations. On 19 August, we announced a partnership with Regeneron to develop, manufacture and distribute REGN-COV2, Regeneron’s investigational antiviral antibody combination, to people around the globe.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic

CASPIAN Phase III trial data also at ESMO underscored long-term benefit in a proportion of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer

September 18, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
WILMINGTON, Del.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Updated results from the PACIFIC Phase III trial showed AstraZeneca’s IMFINZI® (durvalumab) demonstrated a sustained, clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in patients with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had not progressed following concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT).

One in three patients with NSCLC are diagnosed at Stage III, where the majority of tumors are unresectable (cannot be removed with surgery).1,2 Prior to the approval of IMFINZI in this setting, no new treatments beyond CRT had been available to these patients for decades.3,4,5

The results from the updated post-hoc analyses showed an estimated four-year overall survival rate of 49.6% for IMFINZI versus 36.3% for placebo after CRT. Median OS was 47.5 months for IMFINZI versus 29.1 for placebo. With a maximum treatment course of one year, an estimated 35.3% of patients treated with IMFINZI had not progressed four years after enrollment versus 19.5% for placebo. These data build on The New England Journal of Medicine publication from 2018 demonstrating a significant benefit for IMFINZI in the OS primary endpoint.6

Corinne Faivre-Finn, Professor at The University of Manchester and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, and a lead investigator in the PACIFIC Phase III trial, said: “Previously, only 15 to 30 percent of patients with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer survived five years, and the majority eventually progressed to metastatic disease. These data show about half of patients treated with IMFINZI survived four years, and an estimated 35 percent had not progressed, a remarkable advance in this curative-intent setting.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “These unprecedented four-year results reinforce IMFINZI as the established standard of care in unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer and set a new survival benchmark in a setting where cure is the treatment goal. With data also at ESMO for CASPIAN in small cell lung cancer patients, IMFINZI continues to deliver impressive long-term benefits across different types of lung cancer.”

In the primary OS analysis of the PACIFIC Phase III trial, the most common adverse events (AE) (greater than or equal to 20%) among patients treated with IMFINZI versus placebo were cough (35.2% versus 25.2%), fatigue (24.0% versus 20.5%), dyspnea (22.3% versus 23.9%) and radiation pneumonitis (20.2% versus 15.8%). A grade 3 or 4 AE was experienced by 30.5% of patients treated with IMFINZI versus 26.1% for placebo, and 15.4% of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs with IMFINZI versus 9.8% for placebo.

CASPIAN Phase III Trial Exploratory Subgroup Analyses in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020

New exploratory subgroup analyses from the CASPIAN Phase III trial of IMFINZI were conducted to characterize patients deriving long-term benefit. More than three times as many patients treated with IMFINZI plus chemotherapy were alive and progression free for one year or more (PFS ≥12 months) versus chemotherapy alone (17% versus 4.5%). Across all treatment arms, the subgroup of patients who were progression free at one year had a 75% chance of being alive at two years. In comparison, the subgroup of patients whose disease had progressed within one year (PFS <12 months) had a 10% chance of being alive at two years. Clinical characteristics did not appear to identify patients who derived long-term benefit.

Patients with PFS ≥12 months received more cycles of IMFINZI treatment compared to patients with PFS <12 months (median of 25 cycles versus 7). Although patients with greater exposure to IMFINZI had numerically higher rates of immune-mediated AEs, the two subgroups had similar rates of severe AEs, serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation.

The CASPIAN trial met the primary endpoint of OS in 2019, reducing the risk of death by 27% in patients with ES-SCLC treated with IMFINZI plus a choice of chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The safety and tolerability of IMFINZI plus chemotherapy were consistent with the known safety profiles of these medicines. These results were published in The Lancet in 2019 and formed the basis of regulatory approvals around the world.7

Results from the PACIFIC and CASPIAN Phase III trials were presented during the ESMO Virtual Congress on September 19 and September 21, 2020.

Important Safety Information

There are no contraindications for IMFINZI® (durvalumab).

IMFINZI can cause serious, potentially fatal adverse reactions including immune-mediated pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatologic reactions, other immune-mediated adverse reactions, infection, and infusion-related reactions. Please refer to the full Prescribing Information for important dosage modification and management information specific to adverse reactions.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and evaluate with radiographic imaging when suspected. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold IMFINZI for Grade 2 pneumonitis; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, pneumonitis occurred in 5% of patients, including Grade 3 (0.8%), Grade 4 (<0.1%), and Grade 5 (0.3%) pneumonitis. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 1.5% of the 1889 patients. The incidence of pneumonitis (including radiation pneumonitis) was higher in patients in the PACIFIC study who completed treatment with definitive chemoradiation within 42 days prior to initiation of IMFINZI (34%) compared to patients in other clinical studies (2.3%) in which radiation therapy was generally not administered immediately prior to initiation of IMFINZI. In the PACIFIC study, the incidence of Grade 3 pneumonitis was 3.4% and of Grade 5 pneumonitis was 1.1% in the IMFINZI arm. In the PACIFIC study, pneumonitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 6% of patients.

The frequency and severity of immune-mediated pneumonitis were similar whether IMFINZI was given as a single agent in patients with various cancers or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatitis during and after discontinuation of IMFINZI, including clinical chemistry monitoring. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or higher elevations of ALT, AST, and/or total bilirubin. Withhold IMFINZI for ALT or AST greater than 3 but less than or equal to 8 times the ULN or total bilirubin greater than 1.5 but less than or equal to 5 times the ULN; permanently discontinue IMFINZI for ALT or AST greater than 8 times the ULN or total bilirubin greater than 5 times the ULN or concurrent ALT or AST greater than 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 times the ULN with no other cause.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, hepatitis occurred in 12% of patients, including Grade 3 (4.4%), Grade 4 (0.4%), and Grade 5 (0.2%) hepatitis. Hepatitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 0.7% of the 1889 patients.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis or diarrhea. Withhold IMFINZI for Grade 2 colitis or diarrhea; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 colitis or diarrhea.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, colitis or diarrhea occurred in 18% of patients, including Grade 3 (1.0%) and Grade 4 (0.1%) immune-mediated colitis. Diarrhea or colitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 0.4% of the 1889 patients.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated endocrinopathies, including thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and hypophysitis/hypopituitarism. Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies.

Thyroid disorders—Monitor thyroid function prior to and periodically during treatment. Initiate hormone replacement therapy or medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold IMFINZI for Grades 2–4 hyperthyroidism, until clinically stable. Continue IMFINZI for hypothyroidism.
In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, hypothyroidism occurred in 11% of patients, while hyperthyroidism occurred in 7% of patients. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.9% of patients, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) thyroiditis. Hypothyroidism was preceded by thyroiditis or hyperthyroidism in 25% of patients.
Adrenal insufficiency—Administer corticosteroids as clinically indicated and withhold IMFINZI until clinically stable for Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency. In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.7% of patients, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) adrenal insufficiency.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus—Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold IMFINZI for Grades 2–4 type 1 diabetes mellitus, until clinically stable. In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in <0.1% of patients.
Hypophysitis—Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated and withhold IMFINZI until clinically stable for Grade 2 or higher hypophysitis. Hypopituitarism leading to adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus occurred in <0.1% of 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated nephritis, defined as evidence of renal dysfunction requiring use of corticosteroids. Fatal cases have occurred. Monitor patients for abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment with IMFINZI. Administer corticosteroids as clinically indicated. Withhold IMFINZI for creatinine greater than 1.5 to 3 times the ULN; permanently discontinue IMFINZI and administer corticosteroids in patients with creatinine greater than 3 times the ULN.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, nephritis (reported as any of the following: increased creatinine or urea, acute kidney injury, renal failure, decreased glomerular filtration rate, tubulointerstitial nephritis, decreased creatinine clearance, glomerulonephritis, and nephritis) occurred in 6.3% of the patients including Grade 3 (1.1%), Grade 4 (0.2%), and Grade 5 (0.1%) nephritis. IMFINZI was discontinued in 0.3% of the 1889 patients.

Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Reactions

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated rash. Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has occurred with other products in this class. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 rash or dermatitis lasting for more than 1 week or for Grade 3 or 4 rash or dermatitis. Withhold IMFINZI for Grade 2 rash or dermatitis lasting longer than 1 week or Grade 3 rash or dermatitis; permanently discontinue IMFINZI in patients with Grade 4 rash or dermatitis.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, 26% of patients developed rash or dermatitis and 0.4% of the patients developed vitiligo. Rash or dermatitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 0.1% of the 1889 patients.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

IMFINZI can cause severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system. While immune-mediated reactions usually manifest during treatment with IMFINZI, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of IMFINZI. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, exclude other causes and initiate corticosteroids as clinically indicated. Withhold IMFINZI for Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reactions, unless clinical judgment indicates discontinuation; permanently discontinue IMFINZI for Grade 4 adverse reactions.

The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of less than 1% each in 1889 patients who received IMFINZI: aseptic meningitis, hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, myocarditis, myositis, and ocular inflammatory toxicity, including uveitis and keratitis. In patients who received IMFINZI in clinical studies outside of the pooled dataset, myasthenia gravis occurred at an incidence of less than 0.1%. Permanently discontinue IMFINZI if myasthenia gravis does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 30 days or if there are signs of respiratory and/or autonomic insufficiency. Additional clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions have been seen with other products in this class (see Warnings and Precautions Section 5.7 of IMFINZI full Prescribing Information).

Infection

IMFINZI can cause serious infections, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as clinically indicated. Withhold IMFINZI for Grade 3 or 4 infection, until clinically stable.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, infections occurred in 43% of patients, including Grade 3 (8%), Grade 4 (1.9%), and Grade 5 (1.0%). The overall incidence of infections in IMFINZI-treated patients in the PACIFIC study (56%) was higher compared to patients in other clinical studies (38%) in which radiation therapy was generally not administered immediately prior to initiation of IMFINZI. In patients with UC in Study 1108 (n=182), the most common Grade 3 or higher infection was urinary tract infections, which occurred in 4% of patients. In patients with Stage III NSCLC in the PACIFIC study, the most common Grade 3 or higher infection was pneumonia, which occurred in 5% of patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions

IMFINZI can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grades 1–2 infusion-related reactions; permanently discontinue for Grades 3–4 infusion-related reactions.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% of patients, including Grade 3 (0.3%).

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no data on the use of IMFINZI in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of IMFINZI.

Lactation

There is no information regarding the presence of IMFINZI in human milk; however, because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants from IMFINZI, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.

Most Common Adverse Reactions

In patients with UC in Study 1108 (n=182), the most common adverse reactions (≥15%) were fatigue (39%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), constipation (21%), decreased appetite (19%), nausea (16%), peripheral edema (15%), and urinary tract infection (15%). The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥3%) were fatigue, urinary tract infection, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, dehydration, and general physical health deterioration
In patients with UC in Study 1108, discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 3.3% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (>2%) were acute kidney injury (4.9%), urinary tract infection (4.4%), musculoskeletal pain (4.4%), liver injury (3.3%), general physical health deterioration (3.3%), sepsis, abdominal pain, and pyrexia/tumor associated fever (2.7% each)

The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥3%) were pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis (3.4%) and pneumonia (7%)
In patients with Stage III NSCLC in the PACIFIC study (IMFINZI n=475), discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients in the IMFINZI arm. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients receiving IMFINZI. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2% of patients) were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis (7%) and pneumonia (6%). Fatal pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis and fatal pneumonia occurred in <2% of patients and were similar across arms
In patients with extensive-stage SCLC in the CASPIAN study (n=265), the most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were nausea, fatigue/asthenia, and alopecia. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction (≥3%) was fatigue/asthenia (3.4%)
In patients with extensive-stage SCLC in the CASPIAN study (n=265), IMFINZI was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of the patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 31% of patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of patients were febrile neutropenia (4.5%), pneumonia (2.3%), anemia (1.9%), pancytopenia (1.5%), pneumonitis (1.1%), and COPD (1.1%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4.9% of patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy
The safety and effectiveness of IMFINZI have not been established in pediatric patients.

NOTES TO EDITORS

About Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one fifth of all cancer deaths.8 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and SCLC, with about 85% classified as NSCLC and 15% classified as SCLC.9

Stage III NSCLC (locally advanced) is commonly divided into three sub-categories (IIIA, IIIB and IIIC), defined by how much the cancer has spread locally and the possibility of surgery.10 Stage III disease is different from Stage IV disease, when the cancer has spread (metastasized), as the majority of Stage III patients are treated with curative intent.10,11 In 2015, Stage III NSCLC was estimated to affect nearly 200,000 patients in the following eight key countries: China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, and the US, with approximately 43,000 cases in the US alone.2

SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly, despite initial response to chemotherapy.12,13 About two thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.14 Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.14

About PACIFIC

The PACIFIC trial was a Phase III, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial of IMFINZI (durvalumab) as treatment in “all-comer’” patients (regardless of PD-L1 status) with unresectable, Stage III NSCLC whose disease had not progressed following concurrent platinum-based CRT.

The trial was conducted at 235 centers across 26 countries involving 713 patients. The primary endpoints of the trial were PFS and OS, and secondary endpoints included landmark PFS and OS, objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR).

About CASPIAN

CASPIAN is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, global, Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of 805 patients with ES-SCLC. The trial compared IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy, or IMFINZI and chemotherapy with the addition of a second immunotherapy, tremelimumab, versus chemotherapy alone. In the experimental arms, patients were treated with up to four cycles of chemotherapy. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation. The trial is being conducted in more than 200 centers across 23 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is OS in each of the experimental arms.

About IMFINZI® (durvalumab)

IMFINZI is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumor’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

IMFINZI is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. IMFINZI is approved for the 1st-line treatment of ES-SCLC in combination with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy in the US and Singapore. IMFINZI is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and a small number of other countries.

As part of a broad development program, IMFINZI is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumors.

About AstraZeneca Support Programs

AstraZeneca strives to ensure that appropriate patients and their oncologists have access to IMFINZI and relevant support resources. These include educational resources, an Oncology Nurse Educator program and affordability and reimbursement programs, such as Access 360™.

Additionally, AstraZeneca has launched Lighthouse, a program that provides support to patients during any immune-mediated adverse events they may encounter during treatment, through medically trained Lighthouse Advocates. The program aims to make patients’ treatment experience as comfortable as possible. Find out more about Lighthouse at LighthouseProgram.com or call 1-855-LHOUSE1(1-855-546-8731).

About AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action.

An extensive Immuno-Oncology development program focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represent up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.15 IMFINZI, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (POSEIDON and PEARL Phase III trials) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially curative settings (MERMAID-1, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC Phase III trials) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy.

About AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology (IO)

Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumors. Our IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumor immune suppression. We are invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumor types.

We are pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial program that includes IMFINZI as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumor types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumors.

About AstraZeneca in Oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, we are committed to advancing oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca’s main capabilities, we are actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in hematology.

By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumor Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalized combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

 Tagrisso is an irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against CNS metastases and has received BT designation in Jul’2020 for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage EGFRm NSCLC after complete tumor resection with curative intent","ADAURA Phase III trial data at ESMO reinforce the proven clinical activity of TAGRISSO in treating central nervous system metastases

September 19, 2020 01:04 PM Eastern Daylight Time
WILMINGTON, Del.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Results from a prespecified exploratory analysis of the positive ADAURA Phase III trial showed AstraZeneca’s TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in central nervous system (CNS) disease-free survival (DFS) in the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage (IB, II and IIIA) epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), after complete tumor resection.

While up to 30% of all patients with NSCLC may be diagnosed early enough to have potentially curative surgery, disease recurrence is still common in early-stage disease.1-3 CNS recurrence, when cancer spreads to the brain, is a frequent complication of EGFRm NSCLC and these patients have an especially poor prognosis.4,5

Results were presented on September 19, 2020 during the Presidential Symposium of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020 (abstract #LBA1) and simultaneously published with the primary results in The New England Journal of Medicine.

This analysis showed that fewer patients treated with TAGRISSO in the adjuvant setting had recurrence events or deaths compared to placebo (11% versus 46%). Among patients whose cancer recurred, 38% of those treated with TAGRISSO had a metastatic recurrence compared to 61% of patients on placebo. TAGRISSO showed an 82% reduction in the risk of CNS recurrence or death (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.33; p<0.0001). Median CNS DFS was not yet reached in either arm.

In a post-hoc analysis, the estimated probability of observing disease recurrence in the brain at 18 months for patients treated with TAGRISSO was less than 1% versus 9% for placebo among patients who had not experienced another type of recurrence. On the primary endpoint of DFS in patients with Stage II and IIIA disease, TAGRISSO in the adjuvant setting reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 83% (HR 0.17; 95% CI 0.12-0.23; p<0.0001).

Masahiro Tsuboi, MD, PhD, director of the Department of Thoracic Surgery and Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East in Japan, and a principal investigator in the ADAURA Phase III trial, said: “It’s time to change the notion that treatment for early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer ends after surgery, since recurrence rates are still very high even after adjuvant chemotherapy. These new data showing low rates of recurrence, particularly in the brain, combined with the remarkable disease-free survival benefit, clearly demonstrate that TAGRISSO provides patients with more time living cancer-free.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Once lung cancer has spread to the brain, outcomes are typically devastating for patients. We are now seeing TAGRISSO expanding on its proven efficacy in treating progression in the brain in the metastatic setting as a result of its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The striking new data show that TAGRISSO prevents the development of brain metastases in patients with early disease and reinforce that this medicine is truly transformative for patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. TAGRISSO should become the standard of care in the adjuvant setting, just as it is for patients with metastatic disease around the world.”

The safety and tolerability of TAGRISSO in this trial was consistent with previous trials in the metastatic EGFRm NSCLC setting. Adverse events at Grade 3 or higher from all causes occurred in 10% of patients in the TAGRISSO arm versus 3% in the placebo arm as assessed by investigators.

TAGRISSO is not currently approved in the adjuvant setting in any country. TAGRISSO received Breakthrough Therapy Designation in July 2020 for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage EGFRm NSCLC after complete tumor resection with curative intent. TAGRISSO is approved for the 1st-line treatment of patients with metastatic EGFRm NSCLC and for the treatment of metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many other countries around the world.

TAGRISSO IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

There are no contraindications for TAGRISSO
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% of the 1142 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.4% of cases were fatal. Withhold TAGRISSO and promptly investigate for ILD in patients who present with worsening of respiratory symptoms which may be indicative of ILD (eg, dyspnea, cough and fever). Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO if ILD is confirmed
Heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation occurred in TAGRISSO-treated patients. Of the 1142 TAGRISSO-treated patients in clinical trials, 0.9% were found to have a QTc >500 msec, and 3.6% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc >60 msec. No QTc-related arrhythmias were reported. Conduct periodic monitoring with ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs/symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia
Cardiomyopathy occurred in 2.6% of the 1142 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.1% of cardiomyopathy cases were fatal. A decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥10% from baseline and to <50% LVEF occurred in 3.9% of 908 patients who had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment. Conduct cardiac monitoring, including assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment, in patients with cardiac risk factors. Assess LVEF in patients who develop relevant cardiac signs or symptoms during treatment. For symptomatic congestive heart failure, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO
Keratitis was reported in 0.7% of 1142 patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical trials. Promptly refer patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis (such as eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye) to an ophthalmologist
Postmarketing cases consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme major (EMM) have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO. Withhold TAGRISSO if SJS or EMM is suspected and permanently discontinue if confirmed
Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TAGRISSO. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 6 weeks after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception for 4 months after the final dose
Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were diarrhea, rash, dry skin, nail toxicity, stomatitis, fatigue and decreased appetite
INDICATIONS

TAGRISSO is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test
TAGRISSO is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy

About Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.6 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.7 The majority of all NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease while approximately 25-30% present with resectable disease at diagnosis.1-3

For those with resectable tumors, the majority of patients eventually develop recurrence despite complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.8 Early-stage lung cancer diagnoses are often only made when the cancer is found on imaging for an unrelated condition.9,10

Approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and Europe, and 30-40% of patients in Asia have EGFRm NSCLC.11-13 These patients are particularly sensitive to treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which block the cell-signaling pathways that drive the growth of tumor cells.14

About ADAURA

ADAURA is a randomized, double-blinded, global, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with Stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated. Patients were treated with TAGRISSO 80 mg once-daily oral tablets or placebo for three years or until disease recurrence.

The trial enrolled in more than 200 centers across more than 20 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is DFS in Stage II and IIIA patients and a key secondary endpoint is DFS in Stage IB, II and IIIA patients. The data readout was originally anticipated in 2022. The trial will continue to assess OS.

About TAGRISSO

TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against central nervous system metastases. TAGRISSO 40 mg and 80 mg once-daily oral tablets have received approval in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many countries around the world for 1st-line EGFRm advanced NSCLC and EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC.

ALUNBRIG IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Severe, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have occurred with ALUNBRIG. In the ALUNBRIG arm of trial ALTA 1L (180 mg once daily), ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 5.1% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG. ILD/pneumonitis occurred within 8 days of initiation of ALUNBRIG in 2.9% of patients, with Grade 3 to 4 reactions occurring in 2.2% of patients. In Trial ALTA, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group (90 mg once daily) and 9.1% of patients in the 90→180 mg group (180 mg once daily with 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily). Adverse reactions consistent with possible ILD/pneumonitis occurred early within 9 days of initiation of ALUNBRIG (median onset was 2 days) in 6.4% of patients, with Grade 3 to 4 reactions occurring in 2.7%. Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, etc.), particularly during the first week of initiating ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG in any patient with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, and promptly evaluate for ILD/pneumonitis or other causes of respiratory symptoms (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tumor progression, and infectious pneumonia). For Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis, either resume ALUNBRIG with dose reduction after recovery to baseline or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis or recurrence of Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis.

Hypertension: In the ALUNBRIG arm of trial ALTA 1L (180 mg once daily), hypertension was reported in 32% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG; Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 13% of patients. In ALTA, hypertension was reported in 11% of patients in the 90 mg group who received ALUNBRIG and 21% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 5.9% of patients overall. Control blood pressure prior to treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and at least monthly thereafter during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy. Upon resolution or improvement to Grade 1, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose. Consider permanent discontinuation of treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 hypertension or recurrence of Grade 3 hypertension. Use caution when administering ALUNBRIG in combination with antihypertensive agents that cause bradycardia.

Bradycardia: In the ALUNBRIG arm of trial ALTA 1L (180 mg once daily), heart rates less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) occurred in 8.1% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG.

Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 2.7% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurred in 4.6% of patients in the 90 mg group and 5.5% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Monitor lipase and amylase during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzyme elevation. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose or at a reduced dose.

Hyperglycemia: In the ALUNBRIG arm of trial ALTA 1L (180 mg once daily), 56% of patients who received ALUNBRIG experienced new or worsening hyperglycemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory assessment of serum fasting glucose levels, occurred in 7.5% of patients. In ALTA, 43% of patients who received ALUNBRIG experienced new or worsening hyperglycemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory assessment of serum fasting glucose levels, occurred in 3.7% of patients. Two of 20 (10%) patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance at baseline required initiation of insulin while receiving ALUNBRIG. Assess fasting serum glucose prior to initiation of ALUNBRIG and monitor periodically thereafter. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as needed. If adequate hyperglycemic control cannot be achieved with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG until adequate hyperglycemic control is achieved and consider reducing the dose of ALUNBRIG or permanently discontinuing ALUNBRIG.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALUNBRIG.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration of ALUNBRIG with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice as it may also increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib. If coadministration of a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG.

CYP3A Inducers: Avoid coadministration of ALUNBRIG with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. If coadministration of moderate CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided, increase the dose of ALUNBRIG.

CYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of ALUNBRIG with sensitive CYP3A substrates, including hormonal contraceptives, can result in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy of sensitive CYP3A substrates.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Pregnancy: ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.

Lactation: There are no data regarding the secretion of brigatinib in human milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Because of the potential adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with ALUNBRIG.

Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:

Pregnancy Testing: Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ALUNBRIG.

Contraception: Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 3 months after the final dose.

Infertility: ALUNBRIG may cause reduced fertility in males.

Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ALUNBRIG in pediatric patients have not been established.

Geriatric Use: Of the 359 patients enrolled in the ALTA 1L ALUNBRIG arm and in ALTA, 26.7% were 65 and older and 7.5% were 75 and older. No clinically relevant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years and younger patients.

About the NLRP3 Inflammasome

Activated NLRP3 acts as a ‘danger sensor’ in the body to release the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-18 and induce uncontrolled, lytic cell death (pyroptosis). These processes lead to chronic inflammation, and as such, NLRP3 has been implicated in a large number of diseases.

48835,AstraZeneca and MSD's Lynparza (Olaparib) Receives the CHMP's Positive Opinion as 1L Maintenance Treatment for HRD-Positive Advanced Ovarian Cancer,Lynparza recommended for approval in EU by CHMP as 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer,"The CHMP has recommended the approval of Lynparza + bevacizumab for the 1L maintenance treatment of patients with HRD+ advanced ovarian cancer. The positive opinion is based on a biomarker subgroup analysis of P-III PAOLA-1 study
 The P-III PAOLA-1 study involves assessing of Lynparza + bevacizumab vs bevacizumab as monothx. for newly diagnosed advanced FIGO Stage III-IV high-grade serous/ endometroid ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer patients who had a complete or partial response to 1L treatment with Pt. based CT and bevacizumab
 The study resulted in 67% reduction the risk of disease progression or death, improved PFS (37.2 vs 17.7 mos.). Further results of PAOLA-1 trial demonstrated improvement in the time to second disease progression, PFS2 (50.3 vs 35.3 mos.), presented at ESMO 2020","Patients treated with Lynparza and bevacizumab lived without disease progression for a median of 37.2 months vs. 17.7 months for bevacizumab alone
One in two women with advanced ovarian cancer has an HRD-positive tumour

AstraZeneca and MSD’s Lynparza (olaparib) has been recommended for marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) for the 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab of patients with homologous recombination deficient (HRD)-positive advanced ovarian cancer.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency based its positive opinion on a biomarker subgroup analysis of the PAOLA-1 Phase III trial, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The trial showed that Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab maintenance treatment reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 67% (based on a hazard ratio of 0.33; 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.45). The addition of Lynparza improved progression-free survival (PFS) to a median of 37.2 months versus 17.7 months with bevacizumab alone in patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer.

For patients with advanced ovarian cancer, the primary aim of 1st-line treatment is to delay disease progression for as long as possible with the intent to achieve long-term remission.1-3

Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in Europe and the five-year survival rate is approximately 45%, due in part because women are often diagnosed with advanced disease (Stage III or IV).4,5

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Half of all newly diagnosed patients with advanced ovarian cancer have HRD-positive tumours. Lynparza together with bevacizumab has demonstrated a median progression-free survival benefit of more than three years, offering new hope for women in this setting. This recommendation is a vital step toward addressing a significant unmet need and could bring a new treatment option that delays relapse in this devastating disease.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “HRD is an important biomarker of advanced ovarian cancer that can inform how physicians in the EU treat this aggressive type of cancer. This recommendation and the results from the PAOLA-1 trial underscore the importance of HRD testing at diagnosis to determine the best course of treatment for women with advanced ovarian cancer.”

The CHMP recommendation is for Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and whose cancer is associated with HRD positive status defined by either a breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) mutation and/or genomic instability.

Further results from the PAOLA-1 trial recently presented during the 2020 European Society for Medical Oncology virtual congress showed that Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab maintenance treatment demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the time to second disease progression (PFS2) versus bevacizumab alone in patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer, a key secondary endpoint. The results showed Lynparza with bevacizumab provided benefit beyond first disease progression, improving PFS2 to a median of 50.3 months versus 35.3 months with bevacizumab alone.

Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab is approved in the US and several other countries as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer and is currently under regulatory review in other countries around the world.

Ovarian cancer

In 2018, there were nearly 68,000 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in Europe and around 45,000 deaths.4 Approximately 50% of ovarian cancers are HRD-positive including BRCA1/2 mutation.6,7 Approximately 22% of ovarian cancers have a BRCA1/2 mutation.6-8

Homologous recombination deficiency

HRD, which defines a subgroup of ovarian cancer, encompasses a wide range of genetic abnormalities, including BRCA mutations and beyond. As with BRCA gene mutations, HRD interferes with normal cell DNA repair mechanisms and confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitors including Lynparza.9

PAOLA-1

PAOLA-1 is a double-blind Phase III trial testing the efficacy and safety of Lynparza added to standard-of-care bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone, as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for newly diagnosed advanced FIGO Stage III-IV high-grade serous or endometroid ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer patients who had a complete or partial response to 1st-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. AstraZeneca and MSD announced in August 2019 that the trial met its primary endpoint of PFS in the overall trial population.

Lynparza

Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.

Lynparza is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer (BRCAm and/or genomic instability). Lynparza is approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. It is also approved in the US and several other countries for the treatment of germline BRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US for HRR gene-mutated mCRPC (BRCAm and other HRR gene mutations). Regulatory reviews are underway in several countries for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.

The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and Koselugo (selumetinib), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

AstraZeneca in oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

LAVAL, QC and SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif., Sept. 21, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC) (“Bausch Health”) and Bausch + Lomb, its leading global eye health business, and Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC (Allegro), a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies that regulate integrin functions for the treatment of ocular diseases, announced today that Bausch Health (through its affiliate) has entered into an agreement to acquire an option to purchase all ophthalmology assets of Allegro (the “Option”), including global rights for risuteganib (Luminate®)1, Allegro’s lead investigational compound in retina, which is believed to simultaneously act on the angiogenic, inflammatory and mitochondrial metabolic pathways implicated in diseases such as intermediate dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

(PRNewsfoto/Bausch Health Companies Inc.)
It is estimated that as many as 16 million people in the United States have AMD2, and globally, the prevalence of AMD is expected to reach 196 million people worldwide this year and to increase to 288 million by 2040.3 Approximately 90 percent of people diagnosed with AMD have dry AMD, for which there are currently no treatments.4

“As part of the ongoing transformation of Bausch Health, we continue to seek strategic opportunities to build-up our pipeline in core businesses, including Bausch + Lomb, our global eye health business. The addition of the ophthalmic assets of Allegro would significantly enhance our comprehensive portfolio of products for AMD,” said Joseph C. Papa, chairman and CEO of Bausch Health. “If approved, risuteganib may be the first treatment indicated to help reverse vision loss due to dry AMD and would address a significant unmet medical need affecting millions of people globally.”

“Allegro is excited to partner with Bausch Health, an established global player in ophthalmology that values the potential of risuteganib and our integrin-regulating platform as much as we do,” said Vicken Karageozian, M.D., president and CEO, Allegro. “As we prepare for our Phase 3 clinical program, we look forward to working closely with Bausch Health on the united goal of one day being able to offer a treatment option to the millions of people who are currently losing their vision to dry AMD.”

Risuteganib is an investigational integrin-regulating therapy that is believed to reduce mitochondrial dysfunction involved in intermediate dry AMD. By targeting multiple pathways, risuteganib may help reduce the cellular burden of oxidative stress and restore retinal homeostasis.5 Two concurrent Phase 3 studies evaluating the use of intravitreal risuteganib to treat intermediate dry AMD are expected to begin within the next 12 months.

Other ophthalmology assets of Allegro include ALG-1007, a topical integrin regulator under investigation for the treatment of dry eye disease. It is currently in Phase 2 development outside the United States.

The Option payment totaling $50 million would be made in two tranches, with the first payment of $10 million upon signing. Allegro intends to raise additional funding, following which, Bausch Health will make a second payment of $40 million, which is expected to be made in 2021. If Bausch Health then elects to exercise the Option, additional payments will be payable.

48854,Roche Presents New P-III Data of Tecentriq in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer at ESMO Virtual Congress 2020,Roche presents new data from multiple Phase III studies of Tecentriq in triple-negative breast cancer at ESMO Virtual Congress 2020,"Roche divulges results from three P-III studies of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) clinical development program in TNBC at the ESMO Virtual Congress 2020. The P-III IMpassion031 assessing Tecentriq + CT vs PBO + CT demonstrated improvement in pathological complete response (pCR: 57.6% vs 41.1%) in early TNBC patients
 The P-III IMpassion130 study assessing Tecentriq + nab-paclitaxel vs PBO + nab-paclitaxel, as a 1L treatment for patients with m-TNBC. Results: increment in 7.5mos. in median OS, no new safety concerns were identified with longer follow-up
 Lastly, the company presented P-III IMpassion131 study assessing Tecentriq + paclitaxel vs PBO + paclitaxel, as a 1L treatment for patients with m-TNBC. The study did not meet its 1EPs of PFS in the PD-L1+ population, OS data showed a negative trend","Data from the Phase III IMpassion031 study demonstrated that Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy improved pathological complete response for patients with early triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), when compared to placebo plus chemotherapy
Final overall survival data from the Phase III IMpassion130 study were consistent with prior interim analyses in patients with metastatic TNBC, whose tumours expressed PD-L1 and who received Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel
Results from the Phase III IMpassion131 study, evaluating Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of people with metastatic TNBC and whose tumours expressed PD-L1, did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival
Basel, 19 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that it presented the latest results from three Phase III studies from the Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) clinical development programme in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020.

“While we have made great progress in the treatment of many forms of breast cancer, TNBC remains an aggressive and difficult-to-treat disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are proud of our work to address challenges and advance scientific understanding of cancer immunotherapy in the context of distinct chemotherapy regimens and in various TNBC treatment settings. Although the IMpassion131 study did not reach its endpoint, we are pleased to bring new treatment options for some TNBC patients, and remain committed to improving the lives of all women with early and advanced stages of this disease.”

Results from the Phase III IMpassion031 study, evaluating Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy (Abraxane®, albumin-bound paclitaxel; nab-paclitaxel; followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) in comparison to placebo plus chemotherapy (including nab-paclitaxel), demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in pathological complete response (pCR) for the treatment of people with early TNBC, regardless of PD-L1 expression. pCR was observed in 57.6% (95% CI: 49.7–65.2) of patients treated with Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy, an increase of 16.5% from 41.1% (95% CI: 33.6–48.9) in patients treated with placebo plus chemotherapy (one-sided p=0.0044, significance boundary = 0.0184) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The safety profile was consistent with the established profile of the individual drugs and no new safety concerns were identified.

The IMpassion031 study is the second positive Phase III study from Roche demonstrating the benefit of Tecentriq in TNBC, and the first Tecentriq study to demonstrate benefit in early TNBC. Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is currently approved in more than 70 countries worldwide, including the US and across Europe, for the treatment of adults with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC in people whose tumours express PD-L1 (IC≥1%).

The final overall survival (OS) analysis of the Phase III IMpassion130 study, evaluating Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel, compared with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel, as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic TNBC, was consistent with the first and second interim analyses. There was no significant difference in OS between the treatment groups in the ITT population. Clinically meaningful improvements in OS were seen with Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel in PD-L1-positive patients. The magnitude of OS improvements with Tecentriq in PD-L1-positive patients remained clinically meaningful, with an increase of 7.5 months in median OS with Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel, compared with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR]=0.67; 95% CI: 0.53–0.86). However, this result could not be formally tested due to the prespecified statistical testing hierarchy. The cumulative safety of the Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel combination remains consistent with the previously reported safety data for this study and the known risks of individual study drugs. No new safety concerns were identified with longer follow-up.

Finally, results from the Phase III IMpassion131 study, evaluating Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel, compared with placebo plus paclitaxel, as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic TNBC, did not show significant improvement for progression-free survival in the PD-L1-positive population (HR=0.82; 95% CI: 0.60–1.12). The OS data showed a negative trend; however, the study was not powered for the secondary endpoint of OS, and OS data were immature at time of analysis (initial HR=1.55 [95% CI: 0.86-2.80] in the PD-L1 positive population, based on 21% of patients with an event; updated HR=1.12 [95% CI: 0.76-1.65]), updated analysis based on 41% of patients with an event). The safety profile of Tecentriq plus paclitaxel was consistent with the established safety profile of the individual study drugs and no new safety concerns were identified.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMpassion031 study
The IMpassion031 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy (Abraxane®, albumin-bound paclitaxel; nab-paclitaxel; followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) in comparison to placebo plus chemotherapy, in people with previously untreated, early TNBC. The study enrolled 333 people who were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive Tecentriq or placebo plus chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) setting. Treatment with Tecentriq continued adjuvantly (after surgery) for those in the Tecentriq arm of the study. The primary endpoint is pCR using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system in the ITT population and in the PD-L1-positive population. Secondary endpoints include OS, event-free survival, disease-free survival and quality of life measures.

About the IMpassion130 study
The IMpassion130 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel compared with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel in people with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer (mBC). The study enrolled 902 people who were randomised equally (1:1). The co-primary endpoints are PFS per investigator assessment (RECIST 1.1) and OS in the ITT population and in the PD-L1-positive population. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate and duration of response.

About the IMpassion131 study
The IMpassion131 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel, in comparison to placebo plus paclitaxel, in people with previously untreated, inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. The study enrolled 651 people who were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive Tecentriq or placebo plus paclitaxel. The primary endpoint is PFS per investigator assessment (RECIST 1.1) in the PD-L1-positive population followed by ITT populations. Secondary endpoints include OS, ORR and duration of response in the PD-L1-positive and ITT populations.

About triple-negative breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women with more than 2 million diagnosed worldwide each year.1 TNBC represents ~15% of all breast cancers and is more common in women under the age of 50, compared with other forms of breast cancer.2-4 It is defined by the lack of expression and/or amplification of the targetable receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and HER2 amplification.5 Patients with metastatic TNBC generally experience rapid progression and shorter OS compared to other subtypes of breast cancer.3

About Roche in breast cancer
Roche has been advancing breast cancer research for more than 30 years with the goal of helping as many people with the disease as possible. Our medicines, along with companion diagnostic tests, have contributed to bringing breakthrough innovations in HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancers. As our understanding of breast cancer biology rapidly improves, we are working to identify new biomarkers and approaches to treatment for all forms of early and advanced breast cancer, including triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive.

Our targeted medicines Herceptin, Perjeta, Kadcyla and Tecentriq are continuing to transform the treatment of early and advanced HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancers and, through our Tecentriq and ipatasertib clinical programmes, we hope to bring new treatment combinations to people with breast cancer, ultimately improving outcomes.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for people with unresectable or metastatic HCC.

48861,Lilly's Olumiant (baricitinib) Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,CHMP Recommends Approval of Lilly’s Baricitinib for the Treatment of Adults with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,"The positive opinion is based on P-III BREEZE-AD program including BREEZE-AD1 & BREEZE-AD2 studies assessing baricitinib as monothx. in mod. to sev. AD patients
 The CHMP’s recommendation also involves a BREEZE-AD4 study assessing baricitinib + topical corticosteroids in patients with mod. to sev. AD who have failed or who are intolerant to or have contraindications to cyclosporine and BREEZE-AD7 study assessing baricitinib + topical corticosteroids in patients with mod. to sev. AD
 The positive opinion marks the first step toward EU approval for baricitinib for patients with AD. If approved, the therapy would become the first JAK inhibitor for AD with expected EC’s decision in the next 2mos.","Positive Opinion is the First Regulatory Action for Baricitinib as an Atopic Dermatitis Medicine
INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) announced today that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion for baricitinib for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are candidates for systemic therapy.

This opinion marks the first step toward European regulatory approval for baricitinib (marketed as OLUMIANT®) for patients with AD. If approved, baricitinib would become the first JAK inhibitor indicated to help treat patients with AD. The CHMP opinion is now referred for action to the European Commission, which grants approval in the European Union. A final decision is expected from the European Commission in the next one-two months.

“Due to the limited treatment options currently available for adult patients with AD, we’re excited to further explore baricitinib’s potential benefit for patients,” said Patrik Jonsson, Lilly senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. “At Lilly, we aspire to elevate treatment standards for patients with dermatologic conditions. Today’s CHMP opinion brings us closer to providing a new medicine for adults living with AD in Europe.”

The positive opinion was based on Lilly’s Phase 3 BREEZE-AD clinical development program for baricitinib evaluating the medicine’s potential to treat AD including BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, monotherapy studies investigating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in moderate to severe AD patients; BREEZE-AD4, a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in combination with topical corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe AD who have failed or who are intolerant to, or have contraindications to cyclosporine; and BREEZE-AD7, a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in combination with topical corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe AD.

“Patients living with AD face difficulties on a daily basis, and this CHMP opinion marks an important milestone in providing adult AD patients with a new potential treatment option,” said Prof. Thomas Bieber, M.D., Ph.D., M.D.R.A., Professor of Dermatology and Allergy, University Hospital in Bonn, Germany.

OLUMIANT® is already approved in more than 70 countries as a treatment for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Lilly has exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights for baricitinib and certain follow-on compounds for patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases under a license and collaboration agreement with Incyte.

Information on the previously approved EU OLUMIANT indication (Rheumatoid Arthritis) can be found here.

Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients

OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS 

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. If positive, start treatment for latent infection prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:

Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT ≥5x upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST ≥10x ULN were observed in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

HYPERSENSITIVITY: Reactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug sensitivity have been observed in patients receiving Olumiant, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue Olumiant while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg and placebo, respectively.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

About OLUMIANT®

OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderately- to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies, and approved outside of the U.S. for patients with moderately- to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs.1 There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.2 OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.1 OLUMIANT is approved in more than 70 countries. OLUMIANT is developed by Lilly under license from Incyte Corporation.

About Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis (AD), or atopic eczema, is a chronic, relapsing skin disease characterized by intense itching, dry skin and inflammation that can be present on any part of the body.3 AD is a heterogeneous disease both biologically and clinically, but may be characterized by chronic symptoms of itch, redness and skin damage that are often punctuated with episodic, sometimes unpredictable, flares or exacerbations.4,5 AD affects approximately one-three percent of adults worldwide.6 

Moderate to severe AD is characterized by intense itching, resulting in visibly damaged skin.7 Like other chronic inflammatory diseases, AD is immune-mediated and involves a complex interplay of immune cells and inflammatory cytokines.8

48870,Novartis' Kisqali (ribociclib) Receives Highest Score on the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale,Novartis Kisqali receives the highest rating of any CDK4/6 inhibitor on the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scal,"Novartis’ Kisqali + endocrine therapy has achieved 5 out of 5 scores on ESMO-MCBS, confirming substantial benefit for premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- aBC, based on OS benefit and improved QoL in the P-III MONALEESA-7 study
 Kisqali is also the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to receive a score of 4 out of 5 in combination with fulvestrant for 1L postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- aBC based on the OS benefit and maintained QoL observed in P-III MONALEESA-3. Additionally, Kisqali + fulvestrant receive a score of 4 out of 5 in a 2L setting based on the MONALEEA-3 study
 New data presented at ESMO 2020 add to the substantial body of evidence further differentiating Kisqali as the only CDK 4/6 inhibitor that improves OS in two P- III trials, with consistent results across patient subgroups, and with QoL benefits. Kisqali in patients with endocrine resistance led to a 30% & 41% reduction in the risk of death in the MONALEESA-3 & -7 studies over standard endocrine therapy respectively","Kisqali is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor, in combination with endocrine therapy, to achieve a perfect 5 out of 5 score – confirming substantial benefit for premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (aBC), based on significant overall survival (OS) benefit and improved quality of life, in the MONALEESA-7 study1
Kisqali is also the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to receive a score of 4 out of 5 for first-line postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- aBC based on the OS benefit and maintained quality of life observed in MONALEESA-32
New data at ESMO Virtual Congress 2020 add to the substantial body of evidence further differentiating Kisqali as the only CDK 4/6 inhibitor that significantly improves OS in two phase III trials, with consistent results across patient subgroups, and with quality of life benefits
Basel, September 21, 2020 — Novartis proudly announces that Kisqali® (ribociclib) has achieved a score of five out of five on the European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) for first-line premenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer1. This perfect score was achieved as a result of the significant overall survival benefit and the quality of life improvements demonstrated by Kisqali plus endocrine therapy for premenopausal women in the Phase III MONALEESA-7 trial.

Kisqali also received an ESMO-MCBS score of four out of five, the highest score achieved by any CDK 4/6 inhibitor in combination with fulvestrant for first-line postmenopausal patients, based on the statistically significant overall survival benefit observed in the Phase III MONALEESA-3 study and maintained quality of life2. A score of four out of five was also granted for Kisqali plus fulvestrant in the second-line setting based on the MONALEEA-3 study.



Achieving a five on the ESMO-MCBS is the highest grade in the non-curative setting, and Kisqali received the highest scores across the board in advanced or metastatic breast cancer due to the body of evidence supporting the overall survival and quality of life benefits it provides. The ESMO-MCBS is a validated tool for physicians to assess the value of cancer treatments, and ultimately make informed treatment decisions for their patients.

Additionally, new Kisqali data will be presented during the ESMO Virtual Congress 2020 further build on the robust body of evidence. Key presentations include:

An analysis that found Kisqali plus endocrine therapy demonstrated consistent improvement in overall survival in patients with endocrine-resistant HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, which is typically more challenging to treat. Treatment with Kisqali in patients with endocrine resistance led to a 30% and 41% reduction in the risk of death in the MONALEESA-3 and -7 studies over standard endocrine therapy, respectively. Safety was consistent with the overall study populations in both trials4.
An oral presentation of a robust pooled analysis of patient-reported outcomes from MONALEESA-2, -3, and -7 trials in first-line patients, which demonstrated improvement in quality of life for patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer upon receiving Kisqali plus endocrine therapy with consistency in different subgroups analyzed5.
A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), a method used to estimate the comparative effectiveness of treatments after adjusting for differences in the patient populations where head-to-head trials do not exist, indicated that patients taking Kisqali plus fulvestrant as first-line therapy may live significantly longer than those taking palbociclib plus letrozole, based on the MONALEESA-3 and PALOMA-1 trials, respectively6. A trend toward improved progression free survival (PFS) for Kisqali plus fulvestrant versus palbociclib plus letrozole was also observed.
“The totality of these data presented at ESMO confirm the proven overall survival and quality of life benefits with Kisqali, reinforcing it as the standard of care for advanced breast cancer patients,” said Susanne Schaffert, PhD, President, Novartis Oncology. “We are proud to continue advancing the science across multiple breast cancer patient populations, including exploring the potential of Kisqali in early breast cancer.”

About Kisqali® (ribociclib)
Kisqali is the CDK4/6 inhibitor with the largest body of first-line clinical trial evidence demonstrating consistent and sustained efficacy compared to endocrine therapy alone. Overall survival results from MONALEESA-7 and MONALEESA-3 were presented at ASCO 2019 and ESMO 2019 respectively, demonstrating Kisqali plus endocrine therapy significantly extends life in pre/perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. Overall survival follow-up is ongoing for the Phase III MONALEESA-2 trial.

Kisqali was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 and by the European Commission (EC) in August 2017, as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial. Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor was approved for the treatment of pre-, peri- or postmenopausal women as initial endocrine based therapy, and also indicated for use in combination with fulvestrant as both first- or second-line therapy in postmenopausal women by the FDA in July 2018 and by the EC in December 2018. Regulatory filings are underway with other health authorities worldwide.

Novartis is continuing to reimagine cancer by investigating Kisqali in early breast cancer. The NATALEE study is a Phase III clinical trial of Kisqali with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- early breast cancer being conducted in collaboration with Translational Research In Oncology (TRIO).

Kisqali was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals.

Our priority over the past 30 years and today is to deliver treatments proven to improve and extend lives for those diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.

Important Safety Information from the Kisqali EU SmPC
Kisqali® (ribociclib) is a prescription medicine approved in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine – based therapy in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer or fulvestrant as initial endocrine – based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. It is not known if Kisqali is safe and effective in children or adolescents. Kisqali can cause a heart problem known as QT prolongation. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and may lead to death. Kisqali is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen due to an increased risk of QT prolongation. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have a change in their heartbeat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if they feel dizzy or faint. Kisqali can cause serious liver problems. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they get any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark or brown (tea-colored) urine, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, pain on the upper right side of the stomach area (abdomen), and bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. Low white blood cell counts are very common when taking Kisqali and may result in infections that may be severe. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have signs and symptoms of low white blood cell counts or infections such as fever and chills. Before taking Kisqali, patients should tell their health care provider if they are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant as Kisqali can harm an unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant and who take Kisqali should use highly effective birth control during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Do not breastfeed during treatment with Kisqali and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Patients should tell their health care provider about all of the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements since they may interact with Kisqali. Patients should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking Kisqali. The most common side effects (incidence >=20%) include infections, white blood cell count decreases, headache, cough, nausea, tiredness, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, hair loss and rash. The most common Grade 3/4 side effects (incidence >5%) were infections, low neutrophils, low leukocytes, low red blood cells, abnormal liver function tests, low lymphocytes, low phosphate levels and vomiting. Abnormalities were observed in hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory tests.

Genetic modifiers are genes that counteract the effect of a disease-causing gene. They may explain why some people with genetic mutations linked to severe disease end up having only mild or no symptoms. Also known as disease suppressors, genetic modifiers therefore positively influence the severity of disease and act as a ‘natural form of protection’. Their discovery is leading to a completely new class of drug targets.

Under the terms of the agreement, Scenic will utilize its Cell-Seq platform and its data warehouse of genetic modifiers to identify drug targets in multiple therapeutic areas. The collaboration enables Genentech to select multiple targets for further development with an option to extend the collaboration. Scenic will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and is eligible to receive additional target selection fees for drug targets taken forward by Genentech. In addition, Scenic is eligible for success-based payments for each target based on achievement of certain predetermined milestones, as well as royalties on sales of certain products resulting from the collaboration. Total deal value could exceed US $375M.

Scenic has built an extensive proprietary data warehouse of genetic modifiers and its Cell-Seq platform enables the development of potential disease modifying therapeutics for devastating diseases with an in-house focus on inherited rare diseases and immuno-oncology/inflammation.

The Company was founded in 2017 as a spin-out of the Netherlands Cancer Institute, and Oxford University and recently appointed Oscar Izeboud, PhD as its Chief Executive Officer.

Dr Sebastian Nijman, Co-founder and CSO of Scenic Biotech said: “Genentech is the pioneer in innovative biotech and has world leading research and development capabilities. Scenic is a science-driven company and having Genentech as our first major industry partner is a great validation of our technology and by working together it will extend the utility of our platform beyond our current therapeutic areas of interest. The collaboration also brings significant strategic value for Scenic as it enables us to realise the potential of our genetic modifier expertise alongside independently advancing our own programs towards clinical development.”

48885,Alexion's Ultomiris (ravulizumab) Receives the CHMP's Positive Opinion for its New Advanced Formulation,Alexion Receives CHMP Positive Opinion for New Advanced Formulation of ULTOMIRIS (ravulizumab) with Significantly Reduced Infusion Time,"The CHMP has adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization in the EU for a new 100 mg/mL (IV) advanced formulation of Ultomiris (ravulizumab). The positive opinion is based on CMC submission and a supplementary clinical data set showing that the safety, PK, and immunogenicity following administration of Ultomiris (10mg/mL & 100mg/mL) were comparable
 Results: no effect in efficacy measure of mean LDH; reduction in infusion time by more than half (1.3 to 3.3hrs.) & (0.4 to 1.3hrs.) depending on the body weight, respectively. If approved, the new 100 mg/mL formulation will reduce infusion time by ~60%, lessening the burden on patients and health systems
 The company plans to submit regulatory filings in the US and EU in the Q3’21 for an Ultomiris (SC) and device combination for PNH and aHUS that can be self-administered at home, pending completion of the ongoing P-III study and collection of 12mos. safety data. Additionally, Alexion expands the clinical program of Ultomiris across hematology, nephrology, neurology, and for severe COVID-19, with 7 P-III programs that are ongoing or have planned clinical trial initiations in 2020","– If approved, the new 100 mg/mL formulation will reduce infusion time by approximately 60%, lessening the burden on patients and health systems –

– ULTOMIRIS is approved for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) –

– European Commission decision anticipated in November 2020 –

BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Sep. 21, 2020– Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion, recommending marketing authorization in the European Union for a new 100 mg/mL intravenous (IV) advanced formulation of ULTOMIRIS® (ravulizumab). ULTOMIRIS is the first and only long-acting C5 inhibitor administered every eight weeks for the treatment of two ultra-rare diseases—paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). ULTOMIRIS 100 mg/mL would constitute an advancement in the treatment experience for patients with aHUS and PNH by reducing average annual infusion times by approximately 60 percent compared to ULTOMIRIS 10 mg/mL while delivering comparable safety and efficacy. With ULTOMIRIS 100 mg/mL, most patients will spend six hours or less a year receiving treatment.

“ULTOMIRIS is anticipated to be the new standard of care for people with PNH and aHUS and the advanced formulation would reduce the time they spend receiving their infusion. Lessening the overall burden on healthcare systems, especially at a time when many are already under strain due to the pandemic, is an important advance,” said Professor Röth, Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.

PNH is a blood disorder characterized by complement-mediated destruction of the red blood cells that can cause a wide range of debilitating symptoms and complications, including thrombosis, which can occur throughout the body, and result in organ damage and premature death. Atypical HUS can cause progressive injury to vital organs, primarily the kidneys, via damage to the walls of blood vessels and blood clots. Affecting both adults and children, aHUS patients can present in critical condition, often requiring supportive care, including dialysis, in an intensive care unit. The prognosis of both aHUS and PNH can be poor in many cases, so a timely and accurate diagnosis—in addition to appropriate treatment—is critical to improving patient outcomes.

“The advanced formulation of ULTOMIRIS marks continued progress in Alexion’s ongoing efforts to innovate for patients, and we expect it will represent yet another step in refining the treatment schedule for patients,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research & Development at Alexion. “Importantly, it would mean that most patients would spend only six hours or less a year receiving treatment, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their lives.”

The CHMP positive opinion is based on a comprehensive chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) submission and a supplementary clinical data set showing that the safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity following administration of ULTOMIRIS 10 mg/mL and ULTOMIRIS 100mg/mL were comparable. Similarly, the data set showed no notable effect in the efficacy measure of mean lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels across the two formulations. The new proposed formulation requires an infusion time of 0.4 to 1.3 hours (25 to 75 minutes) depending on body weight, reducing the infusion time by more than half compared with the currently available 10mg/mL IV formulation, which ranges from 1.3 to 3.3 hours (77 to 194 minutes) depending on body weight.

The European Commission typically reaches a decision on approval in approximately two months of the CHMP recommendation.

Alexion continues to innovate with ULTOMIRIS, with the goal of improving the patient experience. We plan to submit regulatory filings in the U.S. and EU in the third quarter of 2021 for an ULTOMIRIS subcutaneous formulation and device combination for PNH and aHUS that can be self-administered at home, pending completion of the ongoing Phase 3 study and collection of 12-month safety data. In addition, the collective ULTOMIRIS clinical development programs present an opportunity to expand the treated patient populations across hematology, nephrology, neurology and for the treatment of severe COVID-19, with seven Phase 3 programs that are ongoing or have planned clinical trial initiations in 2020.

About Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 

PNH is a serious ultra-rare blood disorder with devastating consequences. It is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, which is also referred to as hemolysis. PNH occurs when the complement system—a part of the body’s immune system—over-responds, leading the body to attack its own red blood cells. PNH often goes unrecognized, with delays in diagnosis from one to more than five years. Patients with PNH may experience a range of symptoms, such as fatigue, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, erectile dysfunction, dark-colored urine and anemia. The most devastating consequence of chronic hemolysis is the formation of blood clots, which can occur in blood vessels throughout the body, damage vital organs, and potentially lead to premature death. PNH can strike men and women of all races, backgrounds and ages without warning, with an average age of onset in the early 30s.

About Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS)

aHUS is an ultra-rare disease that can cause progressive injury to vital organs, primarily the kidneys, via damage to the walls of blood vessels and blood clots. aHUS occurs when the complement system—a part of the body’s immune system—over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. aHUS can cause sudden organ failure or a slow loss of function over time—potentially resulting in the need for a transplant, and in some cases, death. aHUS affects both adults and children, and many patients present in critical condition, often requiring supportive care, including dialysis, in an intensive care unit. The prognosis of aHUS can be poor in many cases, so a timely and accurate diagnosis—in addition to treatment—is critical to improving patient outcomes. Available tests can help distinguish aHUS from other hemolytic diseases with similar symptoms.

About ULTOMIRIS®

ULTOMIRIS® (ravulizumab) is the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor. The medication works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. ULTOMIRIS is administered intravenously every eight weeks or, for pediatric patients less than 20 kg, every four weeks following a loading dose. ULTOMIRIS is approved in the European Union (EU) for treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity and in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 6 months. It is also approved in the United States (US) and Japan as a treatment for adults with PNH. It is also approved in the U.S. for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients, as well as in the EU for the treatment of adults and children with a body weight of at least 10 kg with aHUS.

Posology and method of administration. Posology: The recommended dosing regimen consists of a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing, administered by intravenous infusion. The doses to be administered are based on the patient’s body weight. For adult patients (≥ 18 years of age), maintenance doses should be administered at a once every 8 week interval, starting 2 weeks after loading dose administration. Dosing schedule is allowed to occasionally vary by ± 7 days of the scheduled infusion day (except for the first maintenance dose of ravulizumab) but the subsequent dose should be administered according to the original schedule. For patients switching from eculizumab to ravulizumab, the loading dose of ravulizumab should be administered 2 weeks after the last eculizumab infusion, and then maintenance doses are administered once every 8 weeks, starting 2 weeks after loading dose administration. Ravulizumab has not been studied in patients with PNH who weigh less than 40 kg. There is no experience of concomitant PE/PI (plasmapheresis or plasma exchange, or fresh frozen plasma infusion) use with ravulizumab. Administration of PE/PI may reduce ravulizumab serum levels. In aHUS, ravulizumab treatment to resolve TMA manifestations should be for a minimum duration of 6 months, beyond which length of treatment needs to be considered for each patient individually. Patients who are at higher risk for TMA recurrence, as determined by the treating healthcare provider (or clinically indicated), may require chronic therapy. Special Populations: Paediatric patients with aHUS with body weight ≥ 40 kg are treated in accordance with the adult dosing recommendations. The weight-based doses and dosing intervals for paediatric patients ≥ 10 kg to 20 kg is once every 4 week interval, for paediatric patients ≥ 20 kg to 40 kg once every 8 weeks, starting 2 weeks after loading dose administration. Data to support safety and efficacy of ravulizumab for patients with body weight below 10 kg are limited. No recommendation on a posology can be made for patients below 10 kg body weight (please refer to the SmPC for currently available data). The safety and efficacy of ravulizumab in children with PNH aged 0 to < 18 years have not been established. No data are available. Method of administration: For intravenous infusion only. ULTOMIRIS must be diluted to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL. This medicinal product must be administered through a 0.2 μm filter and should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. ULTOMIRIS must be diluted prior to administration by intravenous infusion over a minimal period of 1.7 to 2.4 hours depending of body weight (please refer to the SmPC).

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients; in patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection at treatment initiation; in patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis unless they receive prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Special warnings and precautions for use. Traceability: In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. Serious meningococcal infection: Due to its mechanism of action, the use of ravulizumab increases the patient’s susceptibility to meningococcal infection/sepsis (Neisseria meningitidis). Meningococcal disease due to any serogroup may occur. To reduce this risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections at least two weeks prior to initiating ravulizumab unless the risk of delaying ravulizumab therapy outweighs the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. Patients who initiate ravulizumab treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine, must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines against serogroups A, C, Y, W135 and B where available, are recommended in preventing the commonly pathogenic meningococcal serogroups. Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national guidelines for vaccination use. If the patient is being switched from eculizumab treatment, physicians should verify that meningococcal vaccination is current according to national guidelines for vaccination use. Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. Cases of serious meningococcal infections/sepsis have been reported in patients treated with ravulizumab. Cases of serious or fatal meningococcal infections/sepsis have been reported in patients treated with other terminal complement inhibitors. All patients should be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infection and sepsis, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and treated with appropriate antibiotics. Patients should be informed of these signs and symptoms and steps should be taken to seek medical care immediately. Physicians should provide patients with a patient information brochure and a patient safety card. Immunization: Prior to initiating ravulizumab therapy, it is recommended that PNH and aHUS patients initiate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Vaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated diseases, including PNH and aHUS, may experience increased signs and symptoms of their underlying disease, such as haemolysis. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for disease symptoms after recommended vaccination. Patients below the age of 18 years old must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal infections, and strictly need to adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for each age group. Other systemic infections: Ravulizumab therapy should be administered with caution to patients with active systemic infections. Ravulizumab blocks terminal complement activation; therefore, patients may have increased susceptibility to infections caused by Neisseria species and encapsulated bacteria. Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis), including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. Patients should be provided with information from the Package Leaflet to increase their awareness of potential serious infections and their signs and symptoms. Physicians should advise patients about gonorrhea prevention. Infusion reactions: Administration of ravulizumab may result in infusion reactions. In clinical trials, with PNH and aHUS [(4 out of 296 in patients with PNH) and (4 of 89 patients with aHUS)] patients experienced infusion reactions which were mild in severity and transient [e.g., lower back pain, drop in blood pressure, elevation in blood pressure, limb discomfort, drug hypersensitivity (allergic reaction), and dysgeusia(bad taste)]. In case of infusion reaction, infusion of ravulizumab should be interrupted and appropriate supportive measures should be instituted if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur.

Treatment discontinuation for PNH: If patients with PNH discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of serious intravascular haemolysis, identified by elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels along with sudden decrease in PNH clone size or haemoglobin, or re-appearance of symptoms such as fatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), major adverse vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction. Any patient who discontinues ravulizumab should be monitored for at least 16 weeks to detect haemolysis and other reactions. If signs and symptoms of haemolysis occur after discontinuation, including elevated LDH, consider restarting treatment with ravulizumab. Treatment discontinuation for aHUS: There are no specific data on ravulizumab discontinuation. In a long-term prospective observational study, discontinuation of complement C5 inhibitor treatment (eculizumab) resulted in a 13.5-fold higher rate of TMA recurrence and showed a trend toward reduced renal function compared to patients who continued treatment. If patients must discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of TMA on an on-going basis. However, monitoring may be insufficient to predict or prevent severe TMA complications. TMA complications post-discontinuation can be identified if any of the following is observed: (i) At least two of the following laboratory results observed concurrently: a decrease in platelet count of 25% or more as compared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during ravulizumab treatment; an increase in serum creatinine of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during ravulizumab treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during ravulizumab treatment (results should be confirmed by a second measurement), or (ii) any one of the following symptoms of TMA: a change in mental status or seizures or other extra-renal TMA manifestations including cardiovascular abnormalities, pericarditis,

gastrointestinal symptoms/diarrhoea; or thrombosis. If TMA complications occur after ravulizumab discontinuation, consider reinitiation of ravulizumab treatment beginning with the loading dose and maintenance dose. This medicinal product when diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection contains 2.65 g sodium per 720 mL at the maximal dose, equivalent to 133 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction: No interaction studies have been performed. Chronic intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment may interfere with the endosomal neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies such as ravulizumab and thereby decrease serum ravulizumab concentrations. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation. Women of childbearing potential: Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception methods during treatment and up to 8 months after treatment. Pregnancy: There are no clinical data from the use of ravulizumab in pregnant women. Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with ravulizumab. Reproductive toxicology studies were conducted in mice using the murine surrogate molecule BB5.1, which assessed effect of C5 blockade on the reproductive system. No specific test-article related reproductive toxicities were identified in these studies. Human IgG are known to cross the human placental barrier, and thus ravulizumab may potentially cause terminal complement inhibition in the foetal circulation. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity. In pregnant women the use of ravulizumab may be considered following an assessment of the risks and benefits. Breast-feeding: It is unknown whether ravulizumab is excreted into human milk. Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies conducted in mice with the murine surrogate molecule BB5.1 identified no adverse effect to pups resulting from consuming milk from treated dams. A risk to infants cannot be excluded. Since many medicinal products and immunoglobulins are secreted into human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with ravulizumab and up to 8 months after treatment. Fertility: No specific non-clinical study on fertility has been conducted with ravulizumab. Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies conducted in mice with a murine surrogate molecule (BB5.1) identified no adverse effect on fertility of the treated females or males.

Undesirable effects. Summary of the safety profile: The most common adverse drug reactions (very common frequency) are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis and headache. The most serious adverse reactions in patients in clinical trials are meningococcal infection and meningococcal sepsis. Tabulated list of adverse reactions: Very common adverse reactions observed from PNH and aHUS clinical trials (≥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection, Nasopharyngitis, Headache, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Pyrexia, Fatigue. Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10): Dizziness, Abdominal pain, Vomiting, Dyspepsia, Rash, Pruritus, Arthralgia, Back pain, Myalgia, Muscle spasms, Influenza like illness, Asthenia. Uncommon adverse reactions (≥1/1,000 to <1/100): Meningococcal infection, Chills. In paediatric patients with evidence of aHUS (aged 10 months to less than 18 years) included in the clinical study, the safety profile of ravulizumab appeared similar to that observed in adult patients with evidence of aHUS. The safety profiles in the different paediatric subsets of age appear similar. The safety data for patient below 2 years of age is limited to four patients. The most common adverse reaction reported in paediatric patients was pyrexia. The safety of ravulizumab in children with PNH aged 0 to < 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

Transaction Details

Under the terms of the agreement, at closing, GRAIL stockholders (including Illumina) will receive total consideration of $8 billion, consisting of $3.5 billion in cash and $4.5 billion in shares of Illumina common stock, subject to a collar. Illumina currently holds 14.5% of GRAIL’s shares outstanding, and approximately 12% on a fully diluted basis.

The collar on the stock consideration will ensure that GRAIL stockholders excluding Illumina receive a number of Illumina shares equal to approximately $4 billion in value if the 20-trading-day volume weighted average price of Illumina stock as of 10 trading days prior to closing is between $295 and $399. GRAIL stockholders excluding Illumina will receive approximately 9.9 million Illumina shares if the 20-trading-day volume weighted average price of Illumina stock as of 10 trading days prior to closing is above $399 and approximately 13.4 million Illumina shares if the 20-trading-day volume weighted average price of Illumina stock as of 10 trading days prior to closing is below $295. Upon closing of the transaction, current Illumina stockholders are expected to own approximately 93% of the combined company, while GRAIL stockholders are expected to own approximately 7% based on the mid-point of the collar.

The cash consideration to GRAIL stockholders excluding Illumina of approximately $3.1 billion is expected to be funded using balance sheet cash of both Illumina and GRAIL plus up to $1 billion in capital raised through either a debt or equity issuance. In advance of this anticipated issuance, Illumina has obtained financing commitments for a $1.0 billion bridge facility with Goldman Sachs Bank USA.

In connection with the transaction, GRAIL stockholders will also receive contingent value rights, which will entitle holders to receive future payments representing a pro rata portion of certain GRAIL-related revenues each year for a 12-year period. This will reflect a 2.5% payment right to the first $1 billion of revenue each year for 12 years. Revenue above $1 billion each year would be subject to a 9% contingent payment right during this same period. Illumina will offer GRAIL stockholders the option to receive additional cash and/or stock consideration, in an amount to be determined prior to closing, in lieu of the contingent value rights.

We expect the transaction will be accretive to Illumina revenue starting in 2021, and to meaningfully accelerate revenue growth over time.

Structure and Approvals

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. Illumina expects to close the transaction in the second half of 2021.

Following the completion of the transaction, GRAIL will operate as a standalone division within Illumina with a dedicated leadership team to ensure continuation of GRAIL’s success.

 The 1EPs of the studies is ≥35% reduction in the volume of spleen size at the end of Cycle 6. Inrebic is a JAK inhibitor and is the first new treatment for patients with myelofibrosis in nearly a decade","INREBIC® provides new, once-daily oral option for patients affected
by rare bone marrow cancer

MONTREAL, Sept. 21, 2020 /CNW/ – Bristol Myers Squibb Canada (BMS) announced today that Health Canada has approved INREBIC® (fedratinib), a new once-daily oral medication used to treat adults with an enlarged spleen and associated symptoms caused by intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis.1

INREBIC® is the first new treatment for patients with myelofibrosis in nearly a decade to demonstrate a clinically meaningful reduction in spleen volume for patients in the approved population affected by this serious and rare bone marrow cancer.1 A new treatment provides Canadians living with myelofibrosis, and their caregivers, with more options to find a treatment that works for them.

Myelofibrosis is a serious and rare bone marrow disorder that disrupts the body’s normal production of blood cells.2 Bone marrow is gradually replaced with fibrous scar tissue, which limits the ability of the bone marrow to make blood cells.2 Currently, there are an estimated 1,400 to 2,177 Canadians who are living with myelofibrosis.3

“The approval of INREBIC® represents a milestone for the way healthcare practitioners treat this rare disorder, which can have debilitating symptoms,” said Dr. Vikas Gupta, Director, The Elizabeth and Tony Comper MPN Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto. “Canadians living with myelofibrosis now have a new treatment option that may be better suited to their needs and has shown promise for alleviating the symptom burden associated with myelofibrosis.”

INREBIC® is a janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor and is the first new treatment for patients with myelofibrosis in nearly a decade.1,4 JAK proteins send signals that tell the body to make more blood cells, but myelofibrosis makes it difficult for the bone marrow to create normal blood cells, which potentially moves blood cell production to the spleen.1 However, by blocking the activity of JAK proteins, INREBIC® can reduce the size of the spleen and improve symptoms.

“As part of our commitment to Canadians living with cancer, we are excited to provide INREBIC® as a new treatment option for those impacted by myelofibrosis,” said Al Reba, General Manager, Bristol Myers Squibb Canada. “We hope that the option of a once-daily oral treatment will have a positive and meaningful impact on Canadians living with the disease.”

Health Canada’s approval of INREBIC® included findings from the JAKARTA and JAKARTA2 clinical trials. The JAKARTA study, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, involved patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. The JAKARTA2 study, a multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study, involved patients previously exposed to ruxolitinib with a diagnosis of intermediate-1 with symptoms, intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis.

About Myelofibrosis
Myelofibrosis is classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm, a group of rare blood cancers that are derived from blood-forming stem cells.2 Myelofibrosis can lead to anemia and  thrombocytopenia, weakness, fatigue and enlargement of the spleen and liver, among other symptoms.2 In Canada, approximately 36 to 360 people will be diagnosed with myelofibrosis each year.3 Both men and women are affected, and while the disease can affect people of all ages, the median age at diagnosis is 69 years old.3  

About JAKARTA
JAKARTA was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis with splenomegaly and platelet count ≥50 x 109/L. A total of 289 patients were randomized to receive either INREBIC® 500 mg (N=97), 400 mg (N=96), or placebo (N=96) once daily for at least 6 cycles. The median age was 65 years (range 27 to 86 years), 47% of patients were older than 65 years, and 59% were male. Sixty-four percent (64%) of patients had primary MF, 26% had post-polycythemia vera MF, and 10% had post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Fifty-two percent (52%) of patients had intermediate-2 risk, and 48% had high-risk disease. The median hemoglobin count at baseline was 10.2 g/dL. The median platelet count at baseline was 213.5 x 109/L; 16.3% of patients had a platelet count <100 x 109/L, and 83.7% of patients had a platelet count ≥100 x 109/L. Patients had a median palpable spleen length of 15 cm at baseline and a median spleen volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of 2568 mL (range of 316 to 8244 mL) at baseline. (The median normal spleen volume is approximately 215 mL).1

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at the End of Cycle 6 as measured by MRI or CT and confirmed 4 weeks later.1

One of the secondary endpoints was the proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS) from baseline to the End of Cycle 6 as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptoms Assessment Form (MFSAF) v2.0 diary.1

About JAKARTA2
JAKARTA2 was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study in patients previously exposed to ruxolitinib with a diagnosis of intermediate-1 with symptoms, intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis with splenomegaly and platelet count ≥50 x 109/L.1

A total of 97 patients were enrolled and treated with INREBIC® 400 mg once daily. The median age was 67 years (range 38 to 83 years) with 58% of patients older than 65 years and 55% were male. Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients had primary MF, 26% had post-polycythemia vera MF, and 19% had post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Sixteen percent (16%) of patients had intermediate-1 with symptoms, 49% had intermediate-2, and 35% had high-risk disease. The median hemoglobin count was 9.8 g/dL at baseline. The median platelet count was 147.0 x 109/L at baseline; 34.0% of patients had a platelet count <100 x 109/L, and 66.0% of patients had a platelet count ≥100 x 109/L. Patients had a median palpable spleen length of 18 cm at baseline and a median spleen volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of 2893.5 mL (range of 737 to 7815 mL) at baseline.1

The median duration of prior exposure to ruxolitinib was 10.7 months (range 0.1 to 62.4 months). Seventy-one percent (71%) of patients had received doses of either 30 mg or 40 mg daily of ruxolitinib prior to study entry.1

The primary endpoint was the subject response rate, defined as the proportion of subjects who have a ≥35% reduction in volume of spleen size at the end of Cycle 6.1

One of the secondary endpoints was the proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS) from baseline to the End of Cycle 6 as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptoms Assessment Form (MFSAF) diary.1

– This accepted submission is supported by a robust data package including three Phase 3 studies which demonstrate superiority of bimekizumab to placebo, Stelara® (ustekinumab) and Humira® (adalimumab) in achieving skin clearance at week 16

(PRNewsfoto/UCB, Inc.)
BRUSSELS, Sept. 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — UCB, a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the FDA and EMA have accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), respectively, for bimekizumab for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

“After a series of positive Phase 3 data readouts, we are delighted to announce that the U.S. FDA and EMA have accepted our applications to file bimekizumab as a potential new treatment for psoriasis. This milestone brings us one step closer to being able to offer a meaningful new treatment option for people living with this debilitating disease. UCB is committed to providing innovative solutions for people living with serious inflammatory diseases like psoriasis,” said Emmanuel Caeymaex, Executive Vice President Immunology Solutions and Head of US, UCB.

The marketing application submissions for bimekizumab are based on data from a global Phase 3 clinical development program in psoriasis.1,2,3 All Phase 3 studies met their primary endpoints, demonstrating that bimekizumab-treated patients achieved superior skin clearance, at week 16, compared to those who received placebo and Humira® (adalimumab) as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) response of clear or almost clear skin (IGA 0/1).1,2,3

All the Phase 3 studies met their ranked secondary endpoints.1,2,3 Two studies demonstrated superior total skin clearance at week 16, as measured by PASI 100, confirming the superiority of bimekizumab over existing biologic treatments Stelara® (ustekinumab) and adalimumab.2,3 Furthermore, bimekizumab was superior to placebo, ustekinumab and adalimumab in achieving rapid response, defined as PASI 75 at week 4.3 Clinical responses were maintained up to one year in all studies.1,2,3 The safety profile of bimekizumab continues to be consistent with earlier clinical studies with no new safety signals identified.1,2,3,4,5

The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab have not been established and it is not approved by any regulatory authority worldwide. Bimekizumab is currently also being evaluated in Phase 3 trials for potential indications in psoriatic arthritis,6,7 ankylosing spondylitis,8 non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis9 and hidradenitis suppurativa.10,11

About Bimekizumab
Bimekizumab is an investigational humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits both IL-17A and IL-17F, two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.12 IL-17F has overlapping biology with IL-17A and drives inflammation independently to IL-17A.13,14,15,16,17 Selective inhibition of IL-17F in addition to IL-17A suppresses inflammation to a greater extent than IL-17A inhibition alone.10,11 The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab are being evaluated across multiple disease states as part of a robust clinical program.

About BE VIVID
BE VIVID is a randomized, 52-week, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.18 BE VIVID enrolled 570 participants with chronic plaque psoriasis for at least six months prior to screening and with an affected body surface area of at least 10 percent and PASI of at least 12 and IGA score >=3 on a 5-point scale.19

The co-primary endpoints of the study were PASI 90 response (defined as a patient who achieves 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score) at week 16, and Investigators’ Global Assessment (IGA) 0 or 1 response (defined as clear or almost clear with at least a 2-category improvement relative to baseline) at week 16.19 UCB announced topline findings from BE VIVID in October 2019.

About Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory disease with primary involvement of the skin. This skin condition affects men and women of all ages and ethnicities.21 Psoriasis signs and symptoms can vary but may include red patches of skin covered with silvery scales; dry, cracked skin that may bleed; and thickened, pitted or ridged nails.22

Psoriasis affects nearly three percent of the population, or about 125 million people worldwide.21 Unmet needs remain in the treatment of psoriasis. A population-based survey identified that approximately 30 percent of psoriasis patients reported that their primary goals of therapy, including keeping symptoms under control, reducing itching and decreasing flaking, were not met with their current treatment.23 Psoriasis has a considerable psychological and quality of life impact, potentially affecting work, recreation, relationships, sexual functioning, family and social life.24

Forward looking statements UCB
This press release may contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “seeks”, “estimates”, “may”, “will”, “continue” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and beliefs of management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial information, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements of UCB, or industry results, to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19, changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’ efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also, UCB or others could discover safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover, sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, including pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally, a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of UCB’s data and systems.

Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market, or at any particular time, nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.

UCB is providing this information, including forward-looking statements, only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release, either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

Additionally, information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

48942,Novartis to Initiate Pivotal Confirmatory Study of AVXS-101 Intrathecal Formulation in Older Patients with SMA,Novartis Provides Update on AVXS-101 Intrathecal Clinical Development Program,"Novartis has received the FDA’s feedback following their review of data from the STRONG study of AVXS-101 (IT) in older patients with SMA. The FDA has recognized the potential of therapy and recommends a pivotal confirmatory study to augment the existing STRONG data, further supporting the regulatory submission for IT formulation
 The new study will not be initiated in the US until the FDA has lifted the hold while the request for a study is unrelated to the partial clinical hold on AVXS-101 IT. Trial design and other details are being evaluated and an update on the overall SMA program will be provided following the discussions with health authorities
 Zolgensma is an approved therapy in the US, Japan, and Brazil for patients with SMA under the age of two. The company is also evaluating branaplam (LMI070, PO, qw) RNA splicing modulator to expand the treatment options for SMA patients","Novartis Gene Therapies to initiate new pivotal confirmatory study to evaluate use of AVXS-101 intrathecal (IT) formulation in older patients with SMA to further support registration

Basel, September 23, 2020 – Novartis Gene Therapies recently received feedback from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following their review of data from the STRONG study of the intrathecal (IT) formulation of AVXS-101 in older patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The FDA has acknowledged the potential of AVXS-101 IT in this patient population and recommends a pivotal confirmatory study to supplement the existing STRONG data and further support the regulatory submission for AVXS-101 IT.

This guidance provides clarity on the path to registration for AVXS-101 IT. Trial design and other details are being evaluated and a comprehensive update on the overall Novartis SMA clinical development program will be provided at a future time following further discussions with health authorities. This request for a study is unrelated to the partial clinical hold on AVXS-101 IT, and the new study will not be initiated in the US until the hold has been lifted by the FDA. Novartis Gene Therapies remains confident in the overall benefit-risk profile for patients on treatment. This does not impact marketed Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) and the company continues to advance its regulatory filings and intravenous clinical studies.

Novartis Gene Therapies reaffirms its commitment to the SMA community and to pursuing solutions for patients with all types of SMA, including older children and adults. All patients deserve a gene therapy designed to address the genetic root cause of their disease with a single dose.

Zolgensma is approved in the US, Japan and, most recently, Brazil, for patients with SMA under the age of two. Zolgensma also continues to have a strong launch in Europe where it is approved for babies and young children with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1 or SMA with up to three copies of the SMN2 gene, with dosing guidance provided up to 21 kg. More than 600 patients have benefited from Zolgensma, including through clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program. This number is expected to continue to grow as this transformative gene therapy is approved in additional markets and as the company pursues additional studies to fully explore the impact of Zolgensma across a broad population of patients with SMA.

The company’s commitment to SMA extends beyond gene therapy to branaplam (LMI070), an oral, once-weekly RNA splicing modulator also currently under development, to expand the treatment options for SMA patients.

About Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec)
Zolgensma® is designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by providing a functional copy of the human SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time IV infusion. Zolgensma was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in May 2019 and represents the first approved therapeutic in the company’s proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy. In addition to the US, Zolgensma is approved in Japan, Europe and Brazil. More than 600 patients have been treated with Zolgensma, including clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program. Novartis Gene Therapies is pursuing registration in close to three dozen countries with regulatory decisions anticipated in Switzerland, Canada, Israel, Australia, and South Korea in late-2020 or early 2021.

About Spinal Muscular Atrophy
SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death. If left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases.
SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene, resulting in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement. It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression. This is especially critical in SMA Type 1, where motor neuron degeneration starts before birth and escalates quickly. Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so SMA patients with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities. More than 30% of patients with SMA Type 2 will die by age 25.

  Ide-cel is the first CAR T cell therapy accepted for regulatory review for multiple myeloma

PRINCETON, N.J., & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and bluebird bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLUE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review their Biologics License Application (BLA) for idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel; bb2121), the companies’ investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 27, 2021.

“Today’s Priority Review milestone recognizes the potential of this first anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy to address a critical unmet need of patients with multiple myeloma,” said Stanley Frankel, M.D., senior vice president, Cellular Therapy Development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We are pleased by the significant progress that is being made in partnership with patients and the multiple myeloma community to bring ide-cel to adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who are triple-class exposed and may benefit from an important new therapeutic option.”

The BLA is based on results from the pivotal Phase 2 KarMMa study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in 128 adults with heavily pre-treated and highly refractory multiple myeloma exposed to an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody. Results from the study were shared during an oral presentation as part of the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program.1

“Today’s acceptance of the BLA for ide-cel for Priority Review by the FDA marks a key moment in our journey to bring this BCMA-directed CAR T cell therapy to multiple myeloma patients who are in desperate need of new options,” said Joanne Smith-Farrell, Ph.D., chief operating officer oncology, bluebird bio. “Based on the body of evidence we have generated in an advanced, heavily pre-treated patient population, our confidence in the potential of ide-cel as an important treatment option remains high. Together with our partners at Bristol Myers Squibb, we are committed to continue working with the FDA to deliver this promising therapy to patients in an expeditious manner.”

Ide-cel was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA, and PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation and validation of its Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) by the European Medicines Agency for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Bristol Myers Squibb plans regulatory submissions for ide-cel in additional markets outside the U.S. and EU.

Ide-cel is not approved for any indication in any geography.

For Holders of Contingent Value Rights (CVR), Ticker BMY-RT

U.S. FDA approval of ide-cel by March 31, 2021 is one of the required remaining milestones of the Contingent Value Rights issued upon the close of the Celgene acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2019. The other is U.S. FDA approval of liso-cel by December 31, 2020. The company is committed to working with FDA to progress both applications and achieve the remaining regulatory milestones required by the CVR.

About KarMMa

KarMMa (NCT03361748) is a pivotal, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, multinational, Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in North America and Europe. The primary endpoint of the study is overall response rate as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Complete response rate is a key secondary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints include time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease evaluated by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay and safety. The study enrolled 140 patients, of whom 128 received ide-cel across the target dose levels of 150-450 x 106 CAR+ T cells after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy. All enrolled patients had received at least three prior treatment regimens, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody, and were refractory to their last regimen, defined as progression during or within 60 days of their last therapy.

About Multiple Myeloma

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow.2 The exact cause of multiple myeloma is not known and currently there is no cure, however, there are a number of treatment options available to help manage the disease.2 Patients who have already been treated with some available therapies but continue to have progression of their disease have “relapsed” and “refractory” multiple myeloma, meaning their cancer has returned after they have received initial treatments.3

About Ide-cel

Ide-cel is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy. The ide-cel CAR is comprised of a murine extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) specific for recognizing BCMA, attached to a human CD8 α hinge and transmembrane domain fused to the T cell cytoplasmic signaling domains of CD137 4-1BB and CD3-ζ chain, in tandem. Ide-cel recognizes and binds to BCMA on the surface of multiple myeloma cells leading to CAR T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells.

Ide-cel is being developed as part of a Co-Development, Co-Promotion and Profit Share Agreement between Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird bio.

48959,Micreos Initiates P-I/IIa Study Evaluating XZ.700 as the World's First Endolysin Therapy for Atopic Dermatitis,Micreos initiates clinical trial to evaluate world’s first endolysin-drug as a therapy for Atopic Dermatitis,"The company has enrolled the first patient in P-I/IIa Study assessing XZ.700 in 48 patients with mild to moderate AD in the Netherlands. This marks the world’s 1st evaluation of a pharmaceutical endolysin for topical use in humans
 The patients will be treated for 14 days with a cream containing XZ.700 at 3 different concentrations vs PBO. The company expects to complete the study and report the results trial by the end of 2021
 XZ.700 is an endolysin targeting S. aureus, including the antibiotic-resistant MRSA, while preserving Staphylococcus epidermidis, that is beneficial on the skin and helps in healing wounds. XZ.700 targets multiple indications including AD, diabetic wound infections, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma","THE HAGUE, Netherlands, Sept. 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Dutch biotech company Micreos Human Health has enrolled the first patients in a Phase I/IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treated dose-ranging study to assess the safety and efficacy of XZ.700 in patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. The study marks the world’s first evaluation of a pharmaceutical endolysin for topical use in humans.

Endolysin XZ.700 killing S.aureus on the skin
Endolysins are highly specific enzymes that cut the bacterial cell wall, rapidly killing only the target bacteria, regardless of antibiotic resistance, while preserving the skin microbiome. XZ.700 specifically targets Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a bacterium that is considered to be a causative and aggravating trigger for atopic dermatitis, and viewed as an independent cause of itch, irritation and infection.

“The targeted removal of one particular bacterial species, S. aureus, from the skin microbiome, while preserving the beneficial ones is a fundamental new way to treat atopic dermatitis,” says dermatologist Dr. Peter Lio, Scientific Advisor for Micreos and Scientific Advisory Board member for the National Eczema Association. XZ.700 is one of several endolysins Micreos has in its portfolio. A structurally similar endolysin, SA.100, is used in the company’s over the counter (OTC) products for inflammatory skin disorders (e.g. acne and rosacea), found in the Gladskin range, which have been on the market since 2013. Data obtained in earlier Gladskin studies and feedback from doctors and thousands of customers support the pharmaceutical development program: “I am very encouraged by my experience with Gladskin and I am awaiting the findings with great anticipation.”

In this study, conducted in The Netherlands, XZ.700 will be tested for its safety as well as pharmacodynamics and efficacy in 48 patients with atopic dermatitis. They will be treated for 14 days with a cream containing XZ.700 at three different concentrations or placebo. Micreos expects to finish the study and report the results towards the end of 2021. More information about the study can be obtained at this link (www.trialregister.nl/trial/8876).

“Thanks to the targeted nature of endolysins and the fact that emergence of resistance is not expected, we can use them as effective precision tools in the post-antibiotic era, in both chronic and critical situations. With the start of the XZ.700 trial we take the technology to the next level and create tomorrow’s history,” says Mark Offerhaus, CEO Micreos.

About XZ.700

Endolysins are cell wall degrading enzymes, derived from naturally occurring phages. XZ.700 is Micreos’ endolysin in pharmaceutical development which targets S. aureus, including the antibiotic-resistant MRSA, while preserving Staphylococcus epidermidis, considered to be beneficial on the skin and conducive to wound healing. First targeted XZ.700 indications are Atopic Dermatitis, Diabetic Wound Infections caused by S. aureus, including MRSA, and Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma, targeting S. aureus as a possible trigger for malignancy in this form of cancer in the skin.

About Micreos

Micreos develops new biological therapies based on phage & endolysin technology and is considered the leader in this field. The company provides the world’s first targeted antibacterial products set to replace antibiotics. Headquartered in The Netherlands, with a central staff in The Hague, Micreos has a technology centre in Zurich, Switzerland, and three separate business units: Pharma, OTC and Food Safety with operations in the Netherlands and the USA.

48978,Sanofi's Supemtek Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Approval to Prevent Influenza,CHMP recommends approval of Supemtek (quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine) for the prevention of influenza in adults aged 18 years and older,"The CHMP’s recommendation is based on two P-III studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of Supemtek (quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine) in 10,000+ patients aged ≥18yrs. The company expects EC’s decision in Q4’20
 Supemtek is the first and only influenza vaccine to rely on recombinant manufacturing technology and is available in the US since 2017
 Additionally, CHMP also recommends the approval of MenQuadfi for active immunization of individuals aged ≥ 12yrs. against invasive meningococcal ACWY disease with expected EC’s decision by the end of 2020","Positive opinion based on clinical data demonstrating safety and efficacy of Supemtek® for adults aged 18 and older demonstrated in two Phase 3 randomized controlled trials involving more than 10,000 patients
The European Commission (EC) final decision is expected in Q4 2020
Sanofi and GSK’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate is based on the same technology platform
MEDIA UPDATE POSTED ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2020

The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Supemtek® (recombinant influenza vaccine) for active immunization for the prevention of influenza in adults. A final decision is expected in Q4 2020.

The recommendation is based on clinical data demonstrating safety and efficacy of Supemtek demonstrated in two Phase 3 randomized controlled trials involving more than 10,000 patients. In comparison with a standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine, Supemtek reduced the risk of influenza by an additional 30% for adults aged 50 years and above.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing influenza remains a public health priority. as health authorities worldwide seek to prevent what is preventable: influenza and its potentially severe complications, and the burden this causes on healthcare systems.
The risk factors for influenza and COVID-19 overlap, with cases and complications predominantly seen in people above 65 years old, adults with obesity and underlying comorbidities1,2. This led many national and international recommending bodies to reinforce the need for influenza vaccination in this season2,3 – including the World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization4,

Each year, influenza-associated deaths range from 290,000 to 650,0005,6 globally, and the burden on hospitals is around 10 million of influenza-related hospitalizations7.

Recent data also show that influenza can multiply the risk of heart attack by up to 10 times and the risk of stroke by up to 8 times in the week after influenza infection8, demonstrating that the burden of influenza goes beyond its well-known respiratory complications.

Supemtek is the first and only influenza vaccine to rely on recombinant manufacturing technology. This method for producing influenza vaccines differs significantly from the two other production platforms currently in use (egg-based and cell-based). Recombinant technology ensures an exact match of the hemagglutinin protein included in the vaccine to the influenza strains recommended seasonally by the World Health Organization for vaccines, which is an important factor when considering vaccine effectiveness.

Supemtek has been available in the US since 2017 – under Flublok brand name, with over ten million doses distributed since then.

This established technology is currently used for the development of one of Sanofi’s vaccines against COVID-19, developed in partnership with GSK and with the support of US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).

 The FDA’s submission is in addition to the EMA’s agreement on PIP for Xalkori for pediatric patients with r/r systemic ALK+ ALCL. Xalkori is a TKI indicated for metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are ALK+ or ROS1+ as detected by an FDA-approved test and has received FDA’s BTD for the ALK+ ALCL in May’2018","If approved, XALKORI would be the first biomarker-driven therapy for Pediatric ALK-positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma

NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted and granted priority review to the Company’s supplemental New Drug Application(sNDA)for XALKORI® (crizotinib) for the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) that is anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive. XALKORI received Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD) for the ALK-positive ALCL indication in May 2018 and if approved, would be the first biomarker-driven therapy for this type of pediatric lymphoma. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA is January 2020.

“Despite high survival rates for children with ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, many will relapse, requiring novel treatment approaches,” said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “Today’s FDA filing exemplifies Pfizer’s commitment to broadening the use of biomarker-driven therapies in areas with significant needs, such as rare, pediatric cancers. Given XALKORI’s proven efficacy in ALK-positive lung cancer and activity seen in clinical trials investigating relapsed or refractory ALK- and ROS-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, if approved, XALKORI could represent an important step toward improving outcomes for children with this type of cancer.”

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), divided into ALK-positive or ALK-negative disease.1,2 Though the five-year survival rate for children with cancer in the U.S. is now the highest it’s ever been at 80%, children with cancer continue to face challenges in treating their disease, including rare tumor types, variations in medicine response and prolonged risk of side effects. 3

“Children with cancer and their families have been desperate for new and innovative medicines. We applaud Pfizer’s commitment to drug discovery and development to help address childhood cancers, and continue to work together on behalf of patients with these cancers,” said George Dahlman, Chief Executive Officer, Children’s Cancer Cause. “We look forward to potentially having a new biomarker-driven therapy for children with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive ALCL that may help improve these children’s lives.”

The FDA submission is supported by the results from Study ADVL0912 (NCT00939770) and Study A8081013 (NCT01121588). Study ADVL0912 is a Phase 1/2 study conducted in collaboration with the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), evaluating the maximum dose that is safe and tolerable, and assessing clinical activity in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and ALCL. Pfizer provided funding and support to COG for this trial. Study A8081013 evaluated XALKORI in pediatric and adult patients with advanced malignancies known to be ALK-positive other than non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and included patients with relapsed or refractory ALCL. These two studies showed compelling antitumor activity in pediatric and adult patients who received XALKORI.4,5 Please visit clinicaltrials.gov for more information on these studies.

This FDA submission is in addition to the European Medicines Agency’s agreement on a Pediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for XALKORI including the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory systemic ALK-positive ALCL. This decision represents a step forward for potential regulatory submission for XALKORI in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive ALCL in the European Union.

The full prescribing information for XALKORI can be found here.

IMPORTANT XALKORI® (crizotinib) SAFETY INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Hepatotoxicity: Drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with XALKORI across clinical trials (n=1719). Increased transaminases generally occurred within the first 2 months. Monitor liver function tests, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, then once a month, and as clinically indicated, with more frequent repeat testing for increased liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin in patients who develop increased transaminases. Permanently discontinue for ALT/AST elevation >3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin elevation >1.5 times ULN (in the absence of cholestasis or hemolysis); otherwise, temporarily suspend and dose-reduce XALKORI as indicated.

Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis: Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur. Across clinical trials (n=1719), 2.9% of XALKORI-treated patients had any grade ILD, 1.0% had Grade 3/4, and 0.5% had fatal ILD. ILD generally occurred within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Monitor for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Exclude other potential causes and permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients with drug-related ILD/pneumonitis.

QT Interval Prolongation: QTc prolongation can occur. Across clinical trials (n=1616), 2.1% of patients had QTcF (corrected QT by the Fridericia method) ≥500 ms and 5% of 1582 patients had an increase from baseline QTcF ≥60 ms by automated machine-read evaluation of ECGs. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Monitor ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or who are taking medications that prolong the QT interval. Permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients who develop QTc >500 ms or ≥60 ms change from baseline with Torsade de pointes, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia. Withhold XALKORI in patients who develop QTc >500 ms on at least 2 separate ECGs until recovery to a QTc ≤480 ms, then resume at next lower dosage.

Bradycardia: Symptomatic bradycardia can occur. Across clinical trials, bradycardia occurred in 13% of patients treated with XALKORI (n=1719). Avoid use in combination with other medications known to cause bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. If bradycardia occurs, re-evaluate for the use of concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia. Permanently discontinue for life-threatening bradycardia due to XALKORI; however, if associated with concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia or hypotension, hold XALKORI until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of ≥60 bpm. If concomitant medications can be adjusted or discontinued, restart XALKORI at 250 mg once daily with frequent monitoring.

Severe Visual Loss: Across clinical trials, the incidence of Grade 4 visual field defect with vision loss was 0.2% of 1719 patients. Discontinue XALKORI in patients with new onset of severe visual loss (best corrected vision less than 20/200 in one or both eyes). Perform an ophthalmological evaluation. There is insufficient information to characterize the risks of resumption of XALKORI in patients with a severe visual loss; a decision to resume should consider the potential benefits to the patient.

Vision Disorders: Most commonly visual impairment, photopsia, blurred vision or vitreous floaters, occurred in 63% of 1719 patients. The majority (95%) of these patients had Grade 1 visual adverse reactions. 0.8% of patients had Grade 3 and 0.2% had Grade 4 visual impairment. The majority of patients on the XALKORI arms in Studies 1 and 2 (>50%) reported visual disturbances which occurred at a frequency of 4-7 days each week, lasted up to 1 minute, and had mild or no impact on daily activities.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 45 days (females) or 90 days (males) respectively, following the final dose of XALKORI.

ROS1-positive Metastatic NSCLC: Safety was evaluated in 50 patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC from a single-arm study, and was generally consistent with the safety profile of XALKORI evaluated in patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC. Vision disorders occurred in 92% of patients in the ROS1 study; 90% of patients had Grade 1 vision disorders and 2% had Grade 2.

Adverse Reactions: Safety was evaluated in a phase 3 study in previously untreated patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC randomized to XALKORI (n=171) or chemotherapy (n=169). Serious adverse events were reported in 34% of patients treated with XALKORI, the most frequent were dyspnea (4.1%) and pulmonary embolism (2.9%). Fatal adverse events in XALKORI-treated patients occurred in 2.3% of patients, consisting of septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Common adverse reactions (all grades) occurring in ≥25% and more commonly (≥5%) in patients treated with XALKORI vs chemotherapy were vision disorder (71% vs 10%), diarrhea (61% vs 13%), edema (49% vs 12%), vomiting (46% vs 36%), constipation (43% vs 30%), upper respiratory infection (32% vs 12%), dysgeusia (26% vs 5%), and abdominal pain (26% vs 12%). Grade 3/4 reactions occurring at a ≥2% higher incidence with XALKORI vs chemotherapy were QT prolongation (2% vs 0%), esophagitis (2% vs 0%), and constipation (2% vs 0%). In patients treated with XALKORI vs chemotherapy, the following occurred: elevation of ALT (any grade [79% vs 33%] or Grade 3/4 [15% vs 2%]); elevation of AST (any grade [66% vs 28%] or Grade 3/4 [8% vs 1%]); neutropenia (any grade [52% vs 59%] or Grade 3/4 [11% vs 16%]); lymphopenia (any grade [48% vs 53%] or Grade 3/4 [7% vs 13%]); hypophosphatemia (any grade [32% vs 21%] or Grade 3/4 [10% vs 6%]). In patients treated with XALKORI vs chemotherapy, renal cysts occurred (5% vs 1%). Nausea (56%), decreased appetite (30%), fatigue (29%), and neuropathy (21%) also occurred in patients taking XALKORI.

Drug Interactions: Use caution with concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice which may increase plasma concentrations of crizotinib. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers and inhibitors. Avoid concomitant use of CYP3A substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. If concomitant use of XALKORI is unavoidable, decrease the CYP3A substrate dosage in accordance with approved product labeling.

Lactation: Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with XALKORI and for 45 days after the final dose.

Hepatic Impairment: Crizotinib concentrations increased in patients with pre-existing moderate (any AST and total bilirubin >1.5x ULN and ≤3x ULN) or severe (any AST and total bilirubin >3x ULN) hepatic impairment. Reduce XALKORI dosage in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. The recommended dose of XALKORI in patients with pre-existing moderate hepatic impairment is 200 mg orally twice daily or with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment is 250 mg orally once daily.

Renal Impairment: Decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate occurred in patients treated with XALKORI. Administer XALKORI at a starting dose of 250 mg taken orally once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) not requiring dialysis.

 The company will continue to ramp up its manufacturing capacity to meet its goal of providing 1B doses/year. J&J anticipates the first batches of a COVID-19 vaccine to be available for EUS in early 2021, if proven to be safe and effective","First participants dosed in Phase 3 trial (ENSEMBLE) evaluating safety and efficacy of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, JNJ-78436735, also known as Ad26.COV2.S

NEW BRUNSWICK, New Jersey, Sept. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today announced the launch of its large-scale, pivotal, multi-country Phase 3 trial (ENSEMBLE) for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, JNJ-78436735, being developed by its Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies. The initiation of the ENSEMBLE trial follows positive interim results from the Company’s Phase 1/2a clinical study, which demonstrated that the safety profile and immunogenicity after a single vaccination were supportive of further development. These results have been submitted to medRxiv and are due to be published online imminently. Based on these results and following discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ENSEMBLE will enroll up to 60,000 volunteers across three continents and will study the safety and efficacy of a single vaccine dose versus placebo in preventing COVID-19.

Johnson & Johnson has continued the scaling up of its manufacturing capacity and remains on track to meet its goal of providing one billion doses of a vaccine each year. The Company is committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use and anticipates the first batches of a COVID-19 vaccine to be available for emergency use authorization in early 2021, if proven to be safe and effective.

Johnson & Johnson will develop and test its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles. The Company is committed to transparency and sharing information related to the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study – including the study protocol.

“As COVID-19 continues to impact the daily lives of people around the world, our goal remains the same – leveraging the global reach and scientific innovation of our company to help bring an end to this pandemic,” said Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “As the world’s largest healthcare company, we are bringing to bear our best scientific minds, and rigorous standards of safety, in collaboration with regulators, to accelerate the fight against this pandemic. This pivotal milestone demonstrates our focused efforts toward a COVID-19 vaccine that are built on collaboration and deep commitment to a robust scientific process. We are committed to clinical trial transparency and to sharing information related to our study, including details of our study protocol.”

“We remain fully focused on developing an urgently needed, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for people around the world,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “We greatly value the collaboration and support from our scientific partners and global health authorities as our global team of experts work tirelessly on the development of the vaccine and scaling up our production capacity with a goal to deliver a vaccine for emergency use authorization in early 2021.”

The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate leverages the Company’s AdVac® technology platform, which was also used to develop and manufacture Janssen’s European Commission approved Ebola vaccine and construct its Zika, RSV, and HIV vaccine candidates. Janssen’s AdVac® technology platform has been used to vaccinate more than 100,000 people to date across Janssen’s investigational vaccine programs.

With Janssen’s AdVac® technology, the vaccine, if successful, is estimated at launch to remain stable for two years at -20 °C and at least three months at 2-8° C. This makes the vaccine candidate compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels and would not require new infrastructure to get it to the people who need it.

PHASE 3 ENSEMBLE STUDY

The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single vaccine dose versus placebo in up to 60,000 adults 18 years old and older, including significant representation from those that are over age 60. The trial will include those both with and without comorbidities associated with an increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19, and will aim to enroll participants in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and the United States. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine, countries and clinical trial sites which have a high incidence of COVID-19 and the ability to achieve a rapid initiation will be activated.

Built on a legacy of purpose-driven actions and a commitment to diversity and inclusion, the Company aims to achieve representation of populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic in the implementation of its COVID-19 Phase 3 trial program. In the U.S., this includes significant representation of Black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian and Alaskan Native participants.

ENSEMBLE is being initiated in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under Other Transaction Agreement HHSO100201700018C, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at HHS.

In parallel, the Company has also agreed in principle to collaborate with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the UK Government) on a separate Phase 3 clinical trial in multiple countries to explore a two-dose regimen of Janssen’s vaccine candidate.

“With our vaccine candidate now in our global Phase 3 trial, we are one step closer to finding a solution for COVID-19. We used a highly scientific and evidence-based approach to select this vaccine candidate. We are extremely grateful for the tireless efforts of our researchers and for the vital contributions of those participants who have volunteered to take part in our studies. Together, we are working to help combat this pandemic,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Johnson & Johnson.

The Company is in ongoing discussions with many stakeholders, including national governments and global organizations, as part of its efforts to meet its commitment to make the vaccine candidate accessible globally, provided the vaccine is demonstrated to be safe and effective and following regulatory approval.

NfL is a highly specific biomarker for nerve cell injury measured in cerebral spinal fluid and blood. Blood NfL levels have been reported to change in a variety of serious neurological conditions, including MS and have been related to disease activity and disability outcomes.1

MS is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage in the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord.2 The Multiple Sclerosis Foundation estimates that more than 2.5 million people in the world and more than 400,000 people in the United States have MS. By 2025, an estimated $23 billion will be spent annually on treating the disease.3

Novartis, as a leading pharmaceutical company in neuroscience, has a strong ongoing commitment to bring transformative treatments to people suffering from neurological conditions, such as MS, where there is a high unmet need.

This collaboration will leverage Siemens Healthineers’ expertise in the development of innovative clinical diagnostic solutions that can run on Siemens Healthineers global population of ADVIA Centaur and Atellica immunoassay platforms designed for use in hospitals, reference laboratories, and specialty laboratories.

“We are looking forward to our collaboration with Novartis as it promises to yield innovative diagnostic solutions to address critical unmet clinical needs,” said Deepak Nath, PhD, President, Laboratory Diagnostics, Siemens Healthineers. “Our initial focus on blood-based diagnostic solutions for MS patients is another example of Siemens Healthineers commitment to shape the future of precision medicine.”

The global burden of chronic neurological diseases4 continues to increase, and a 2016 study concluded that neurology disorders are the second leading cause of death and leading cause of DALYs (disability-adjusted life-year). Serum NfL would expand Siemens Healthineers Laboratory Diagnostics Neurology test menu, which also targets AB42 and Tau assays for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The Siemens Healthineers AB42 and Tau assays were recently granted FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for expedited reviews.

Additionally, Siemens Healthcare Laboratory, based in Berkeley, CA, offers a range of neurobiomarker testing services, including serum NfL, for biopharmaceutical company therapy development programs. Siemens Healthineers also offers a comprehensive range of Neuroradiology products and services.

AC Immune remains in a strong financial position with operations fully financed through Q1 2024

LAUSANNE, Switzerland,, Sept. 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — AC Immune SA (NASDAQ: ACIU), a Swiss-based, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a broad pipeline focused on neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, has informed the Company of top line results from a Phase 2 trial of the anti-Tau antibody, semorinemab, in early (prodromal to mild) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) which show that semorinemab did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of reducing decline on Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) compared to placebo. Two secondary endpoints, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog13) and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Group – Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) were also not met.

Additional data analyses are ongoing and Genentech plans to present the results from TAURIEL at an upcoming medical congress. The second Phase 2 (LAURIET) study of semorinemab in patients with moderate AD remains ongoing.

Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune SA, commented: “Today’s news is surprising and disappointing, given what we as a field know about Tau and its strong spatiotemporal correlation with both symptoms and pathology in AD. We believe the full data analysis of this first-of-its-kind study will yield information about this promising target that will advance our understanding and inform future efforts to successfully develop effective therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). We would like to thank the patients, caregivers and investigators who participated in this important, ground-breaking trial and look forward to the final results from our partner, Genentech.”

Prof. Pfeifer continued, “Our proprietary technology platforms and proven business model of discovery, early development and partnering high-risk therapeutic candidates for AD have successfully generated CHF 334 million in non-dilutive funding and enabled us to accelerate clinical development of our product candidates in collaboration with world-leading partners. This strategy enables us to focus our resources on advancing the next generation of first-in-class or best-in-class assets. With current funding through Q1 2024, this robust risk-and-financial-sharing strategy will continue unaffected as we work diligently to mature our proprietary candidates and generate substantial future value for the Company.”

“One of AC Immune’s key strengths is our diversified approach and our broad pipeline of assets, fueled by our remarkably efficient SupraAntigen™ and Morphomer™ platforms and staff. This is evidenced by our novel therapeutic candidates targeting TDP-43 and alpha-synuclein, which have advanced rapidly from discovery into IND-enabling studies. Furthermore, we are particularly pleased with progress in our recently disclosed discovery program targeting the NLRP3–ASC inflammasome,” Prof. Pfeifer added.

Both TDP-43 and alpha-synuclein are major pathologies in NDD and are increasingly thought to be important co-pathologies in AD. AC Immune’s programs directed towards these targets are the most advanced and comprehensive in the field. AC Immune’s alpha-synuclein positron emission tomography (PET) tracer program for Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnostics was recently recognized by the Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) award. Activation of the NLRP3-ASC inflammasome leads to chronic and uncontrolled inflammation, which is understood to drive a number of neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. AC Immune’s approach has high potential for effective therapies, in NDD and non-NDD as mono- and/or combination therapy.

Broad Pipeline and Upcoming Milestones in 2020
AC Immune’s additional anti-Tau clinical assets are outlined below as well as additional milestone tables from the broader pipeline.

ACI-35.030 (anti-Tau vaccine): ACI-35.030 is the first anti-phospho-Tau (pTau) vaccine to reach Phase 2 clinical development. The vaccine generates a polyclonal antibody response that targets epitopes that differ from the epitope targeted by the monoclonal semorinemab. Importantly, these epitopes include an epitope specific to pTau, which is the pathological form of Tau protein responsible for the formation of tangles in AD. Additionally, the antibodies generated by this active immunization approach have pharmacokinetic properties that differ from those of injected semorinemab.
ACI-3024 (anti-Tau inhibitor): ACI-3024 is a first-in-class small molecule that passes through cell membranes to allow for the inhibition of intracellular Tau aggregates, which is not easily achieved with a large antibody like semorinemab. Phase 1 results in healthy volunteers and data disclosure are expected by Eli Lilly and Company in 2020.
Tau- PET tracer: AC Immune’s Tau-PET tracer has the potential to work as a critical tool in the further development of anti-Tau approaches by facilitating the design of clinical trials that hit on two key aspects of AC Immune’s Roadmap to Successful Therapies for Neurodegenerative Diseases – treating earlier and targeting more homogeneous populations. PI-2620 is currently being evaluated in a longitudinal Phase 2 study in patients with AD and a Phase 1 study (test/retest) in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
Details of the TAURIEL study
The Phase 2 TAURIEL study of semorinemab is a 73-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if it can slow the rate of clinical decline in early (prodromal to mild) AD. The study followed 457 participants across 97 study centers. The study did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of reducing decline on Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) compared to placebo, but did meet the primary safety endpoint. Overall, the incidence of adverse events was similar between semorinemab and placebo arms and further analysis of these safety data are currently underway. Two secondary endpoints, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog13) and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Group – Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) also were not met. Analysis of additional data, including biomarkers such as Tau-PET, are ongoing and Genentech plans to present the results from the study at an upcoming medical congress. The second Phase 2 (LAURIET) study of semorinemab, in a different patient population, moderate AD, is ongoing.
