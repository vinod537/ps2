Post,PharmaShots Interview: Astellas’ Txema Sanz Shares Insights on the Evrenzo (roxadustat) for Symptomatic Anemia Associated with Chronic Kidney Disease,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Txema Sanz, Senior Vice President and Head of the Global Medical Specialties at Astellas </strong>shared his views on the <strong>EC’s approval </strong>of <strong>Evrenzo (roxadustat)</strong> for the Treatment of<strong> symptomatic anemia associated with Chronic Kidney Disease</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The approval is based on the P-III program including 8 studies evaluating Evrenzo in 9600 patients with symptomatic anemia associated with CKD, regardless of dialysis status &amp; prior ESA treatment. Following the EC’s approval, FibroGen to receive $120M milestones along with royalties based upon EU sales</li><li>The results demonstrated that the therapy was effective in maintaining target Hb levels &amp; safety profile is reflective for CKD populations compared to ESAs</li><li>Roxadustat is a HIF-PH inhibitor &amp; is approved in EU member states, including the EEA countries, Japan, China, Chile &amp; South Korea for the same indication in adult patients on DD &amp; NDD</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss in brief, CKD, and anemia of CKD along with its epidemiology.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Txema Sanz:</strong><em>&nbsp;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a highly prevalent and underdiagnosed condition, affecting approximately one in 10 people globally. It is recognized as a global public health issue and is projected to become the fifth most common cause of premature death by 2040.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Anemia is a common and early complication of CKD affecting approximately 20% of CKD patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Multiple factors cause anemia of CKD, including reduced oxygen sensing in the kidney, reduced erythropoietin production, chronic inflammation that results in increased hepcidin levels, and iron deficiency.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Anemia of CKD has a significant negative impact on patients’ everyday lives, reducing their ability to exercise, work and perform everyday tasks. Additionally, anemia of CKD is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, cardiovascular (CV) complications, and worsening kidney function.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Despite this many patients with anemia of CKD remain untreated or undertreated, in part due to the complexities of current treatment approaches.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Give a brief description of EVRENZO’s work with the HIF-PH family.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Txema Sanz:</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>Astellas is very pleased EVRENZO (roxadustat) has been approved as the first orally administered hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase (PH) inhibitor and believes it offers an important new therapeutic option for the management of symptomatic anemia in adults with CKD in the EU.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>­The research teams that first identified the HIF protein complex and the way the body responds to low oxygen, were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2019 for their work. This award-winning discovery is the target pathway, integral to the mechanism of action of roxadustat&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oral EVRENZO supports the management of anemia by increasing hemoglobin (Hb) levels through a different mechanism of action (MoA) compared with the current standard of care, injectable erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), which are typically co-administered with IV iron.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>As a HIF-PH inhibitor, EVRENZO activates the body’s natural response to reduced oxygen levels in the blood.&nbsp;</li><li>This response involves the regulation of multiple, coordinated physiological processes that leads to increased stimulation of red blood cell production and increased availability of iron thus providing anemia management with a reduced need for IV iron.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Summarize the journey of EVRENZO’s clinical study. What benefits of EVRENZO have been shown in studies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Txema Sanz:</strong><em>&nbsp;The European Commission’s decision and the recent approval in the UK are based on the results from a comprehensive pivotal P-III program comprising eight multicenter and randomized studies, which involved 9,600 patients worldwide.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The results of the roxadustat clinical program support the efficacy of roxadustat in achieving and maintaining target Hb levels (10–12 g/dL) in patients with anemia of CKD regardless of dialysis status and irrespective of prior ESA treatment with a reduced need for IV iron.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The safety profile observed in the roxadustat development program is reflective of the CKD populations studied and comparable with ESAs.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you planning for the study of drugs on some other type of anemia?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Txema Sanz:</strong><em> In August 2019, Astellas’ co-development partner FibroGen initiated a P-II study in the U.S. investigating the efficacy and safety of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy for non-myeloid malignancies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>For more information about this study, visit&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.clinicaltrial.gov"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>www.clinicaltrial.gov</em></a><em>&nbsp;[NCT04076943]&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Roxadustat is in P-III development for the treatment of anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we have a discussion on the Rx+ healthcare solution? How can it be helpful to the patients?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Txema Sanz:</strong><em>&nbsp;At Astellas, Changing Tomorrow is the ethos that guides everything we do. We combine promising science and the latest technology with our expertise and passion to make a difference, to deliver treatments and solutions that improve the lives of patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our Rx+ story defines the type of society we want to realize through Rx+, the VALUE provided by it, as well as the business domains associated with this area.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We have identified key areas and priorities for Rx+, with the aim of realizing a world where people can live mentally and physically healthy lives and be true to themselves through healthcare solutions based on scientific evidence.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our three core VALUES include:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Preventing disease onset and slow progression by using personal data</em></li><li><em>Expanding options for people with limited access to current therapeutics</em></li><li><em>Supporting active living by enhancing physical and sensory function</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Several Rx+ programs are steadily progressing within our six established areas: (1) Chronic Disease Progression Prevention; (2) Motor Function Support/Replacement; (3) Digital × Neuroscience; (4) Patient w/o Effective Medicines; (5) Patient Outcome Maximization via Precise Surgery/Diagnosis; and (6) Sensory Function Support/Replacement.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How much EVRENZO sparked the economy of Astellas after the approval of EC? Do you think the product will boost more?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Txema Sanz:</strong><em>&nbsp;EVRENZO is an important medicine within our specialty care business and we hope that it will contribute to the management of the anemia of CKD in many patients worldwide. Current projected sales (potential peal sales) are between 50 and 100 billion yen in Astellas territories only.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you shed some light on Astellas' contribution to the healthcare sector?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Txema Sanz:</strong><em>&nbsp;At Astellas, we are working to turn innovative science into value for patients. Our research focuses predominantly on areas of high unmet need in under-served and serious diseases.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our current R&amp;D pipeline focuses on four key areas such as immune-oncology, genetic regulation (mainly for muscle diseases), regeneration (cell therapy mainly for ophthalmology), and mitochondrial biology (mainly for renal and muscle diseases).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In October 2019, - the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Astellas Fast Track designation for treatments focused on patients at increased risk of developing moderate to severe acute kidney injury (AKI) after coronary artery bypass and/or valve surgery.

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss about the terms and conditions of Syndax’s exclusive collaboration with Incyte.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Briggs:</strong><em>&nbsp;Syndax and Incyte are seeking to develop axatilimab as a backbone therapy for patients with cGVHD as well as in additional indications where CSF-1R-dependent monocytes and macrophages are believed to contribute to organ fibrosis.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Under the terms of the agreement, Incyte will lead global commercial activities for axatilimab across all indications. The companies will participate in a 50:50 profit share in the U.S., and Syndax will receive double-digit royalties on sales outside of the U.S. Syndax will retain the option to co-promote axatilimab for any approved indications in the U.S. In connection with the agreement, Syndax will receive an upfront payment of $117 million-plus a $35 million equity investment, which will be purchased at $24.62 per share, a 30% premium to the volume-weighted average price over the 10 days before September 24, 2021. Syndax will also be eligible to receive up to an additional $450 million in potential regulatory, development, and commercial milestone payments.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The companies will share development costs associated with global and U.S.-specific trials for all agreed-upon trials at a rate of 55% (Incyte) and 45% (Syndax), with Incyte responsible for 100% of future development costs for trials that are specific to ex-U.S. countries. Syndax will fund the initial development of axatilimab in IPF and Incyte will have the option to co-fund late-stage development for this indication.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Highlights the key features of Axatilimab (its MOA, ROA, etc.)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Briggs:&nbsp;</strong><em>Axatilimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that targets colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor or CSF-1R, a cell surface protein thought to control the survival and function of monocytes and macrophages. In pre-clinical models, inhibition of signaling through the CSF-1 receptor has been shown to reduce the number of disease-mediating macrophages along with their monocyte precursors, which has been shown to play a key role in the fibrotic disease process underlying diseases, such as chronic graft-versus-host disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the study design and the data of the P-I/II trial (AGAVE-201).</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Briggs:&nbsp;</strong><em>AGAVE-201 is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of axatilimab at 3 different dose levels in patients with recurrent or refractory active cGVHD who have received at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy due to progression of the disease, intolerability or toxicity. Disease progression is defined 1) by the NIH 2014 consensus criteria, either in terms of an organ-specific algorithm or global assessment, or 2) as active, symptomatic cGVHD for whom the physician believes that a new line of systemic therapy is required.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Enrollment continues in the ongoing global pivotal Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial of axatilimab monotherapy in patients with cGVHD, with topline data expected in 2023.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are Syndax's upcoming plans for Axatilimab to treat other indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Briggs:&nbsp;</strong><em>In addition to the AGAVE-201 trial, Syndax and Incyte have plans to expand the development of Axatilimab within cGVHD and beyond. Our initial steps toward this effort include expansion to earlier lines of cGVHD with the initiation of a Phase 2 trial in combination with a JAK inhibitor in patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD. And beyond cGVHD, to commence a Phase 2 proof of concept trial of axatilimab in patients with IPF, a serious, life-limiting orphan disease for which axatilimab could represent a much-needed treatment option with a novel mechanism of action. Both these trials are expected to commence in 2022 with the exploration of additional opportunities following over time.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we have a discussion on chronic Graft vs. Host Disease (cGVHD)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Briggs:&nbsp;</strong><em>cGVHD, an immune response of the donor-derived hematopoietic cells against recipient tissues, is a serious, potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which can last for years. cGVHD is estimated to develop in approximately 40% of transplant recipients and affects approximately 14,000 patients in the U.S.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>cGVHD typically manifests across multiple organ systems, with skin and mucosa being commonly involved, and is characterized by the development of fibrotic tissue. As a result of cGVHD, patients may experience symptoms including shortness of breath, muscle weakness, and cramps, painful mouth ulcers, rash and hair loss, as well as other potential symptoms in the mouth, lungs, liver, muscles and joints, genitalia, and GI tract, as well as on the skin and nails. Patients with more severe symptoms or multi-organ involvement typically require systemic treatment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you think Axatilimab will serve as a backbone therapy for patients with cGVHD and other immune-mediated diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Briggs:&nbsp;</strong><em>In clinical trials, Axatilimab has demonstrated deep, durable responses and multiorgan clinical benefit in patients with cGVHD refractory to multiple therapeutic agents. Based on this data, Axatilimab was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with cGVHD and is currently being evaluated in the global pivotal Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial in patients with cGVHD.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Through its ability to inhibit monocyte-derived macrophages, which play a key role in the fibrotic disease process, we believe axatilimab could represent a meaningful therapeutic approach for cGVHD, as well as other fibrotic diseases</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Put some light on your pipeline and the other indications, Syndax is currently working on.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Briggs:&nbsp;</strong><em>In addition to axatilimab, our pipeline includes SNDX-5613, a highly selective inhibitor of the Menin–MLL binding interaction, and entinostat, a class I HDAC inhibitor. SNDX-5613 is currently being evaluated in the Company's AUGMENT-101 Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial for the treatment of a subset of relapsed/refractory acute leukemias. Phase 1 topline data was presented in April 2021 which showcased its strong single-agent activity in patients with mixed lineage leukemia rearranged (MLLr) or nucleophosmin mutation (mNPM1). In June 2021, we announced that the FDA has granted Fast Track Designation to SNDX-5613 for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with either mutation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you open to more collaborations and agreements for the development of Axatilimab?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Briggs:&nbsp;</strong><em>We are thrilled to be working alongside the talented and determined Incyte team to combine our expertise as we strive to provide new treatment options for patients in desperate need of effective interventions. Incyte is a proven leader in the development and commercialization of many important innovative therapies, including treatment for GVHD, and the collaboration we have established is a global partnership for all indications. Depending on where we choose to develop axatilimab beyond cGVHD and IPF, we may of course pursue clinical collaborations, but we are excited to work with Incyte a leader in cGHVD, with a commercial footprint that can support and enable a global launch across multiple indications.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What next, we can expect from the Syndax in terms of clinical trials, collaborations, some HCPs programs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Briggs:&nbsp;</strong><em>At Syndax, we believe that it takes a community to build a great medicine, and that is why we are working to set the new standard for developing medicines in the field of oncology – one that revolves around collaboration, shared learning, and excellence. We remain committed to our mission to realize a future in which people with cancer live longer and better than ever before.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our Phase 1/2 AUGMENT-101 and Phase 2 AGAVE-201 clinical trials are currently recruiting patients, and we look forward to bringing our medicines to new patients with relapsed or refractory MLLr or mNPM1 acute leukemias and cGVHD, respectively.</em></p>

Additionally, BioCorRx has received the US FDA’s clearance to move into human trials for BICX104 and is expected to start the first-in-human clinical trial shortly</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you please share a brief description of the BICX104 naltrexone pellet?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brady:</strong>&nbsp;<em>BICX104 is a one-gram pellet of nearly pure naltrexone about the size of the tip of one’s pinky finger. It is subcutaneously implanted in the belly flat and should dissolve over three months. It is currently being studied and developed to address both opioid and alcohol use disorders.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How will this drug help people to overcome their addiction?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brady:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Once implanted, naltrexone, a drug that has been FDA-approved for many years, is released in the body and reaches the brain where it blocks the same receptors that opioids bind to. It’s designed to do this for a few months, thereby blocking the effects, as well as the cravings, for these substances. Naltrexone is a proven treatment and our pellet is a new delivery method aimed at aiding patient adherence to treatment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we take a quick look at the BICX104 study design for P-I?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Highlight BioCorRx’s agreement with Recro pharma. How will it be helpful in the advancement of BICX104?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brady:</strong>&nbsp;<em>IRISYS, a company now owned by Recro Pharma, has been our R&amp;D manufacturing partner since the early stages of the program. We have engaged with them to expand that relationship to clinical and commercial batch manufacturing. With Recro recently acquiring IRISYS, we feel it brings an added level of support and expertise to the overall project.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are there any other indications BioCorRx is accessing with BICX104?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brady:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We have guidance from the FDA via our initial Pre-IND meeting that we can use the data to seek approval for alcohol use disorder as well. There could be other indications in the future.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are there any other products in the BioCorRx pipeline?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brady:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We are always evaluating other products but they would be very early stage and as a small company, our main objective is to get this potentially life-saving product, BICX104, on the market.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we discuss the fund that BioCorRx received from NIDA? What more are you expecting from such authorities for the development of BICX104?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brady:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We have been very grateful for the support from NIH/NIDA over the years. They have been great partners and continue to be great partners. This is a very important project for them and the general public. We recently received an additional $3.4 million to support the project for a total of nearly $9.2 million to date and we are currently accessing what other needs we may have as we progress.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Tell us more about the statistical data of people in the US who are addicted to drugs or alcohol/the people suffering from substance use disorders.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brady:</strong>&nbsp;<em>According to the National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug overdoses have spiked almost&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>30 percent during</em></a><em>&nbsp;the coronavirus pandemic</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>More than 93,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2020, the highest number on record,&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&nbsp;</em></a><em>&nbsp;Fentanyl was involved in more than 60% of those overdoses deaths last year. The estimate of over 93,000 translates to an average of more than 250 deaths each day, or roughly 11 every hour.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><em>The&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance-covid-19/COVSALES.htm#fig21"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</em></a><em>&nbsp;(NIAAA) has stated that U.S. adults bought more alcohol during most months of 2020 than the previous 3 years.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: In</strong>&nbsp;<strong>comparison with other therapies that exist in the market for substance use disorders, how is BICX104 unique?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brady:</strong>&nbsp;<em>BICX104 is unique because it fills a current void in the currently available FDA-approved opioid antagonist treatments. Naltrexone is effective for opioid use disorder and other indications which is unique to other forms of medication-assisted treatment and it also doesn’t involve withdrawals once discontinued. When looking at strictly naltrexone products, it is unique in that it’s designed to last multiple months after one administration, however, it can be removed if required for any reason. Another characteristic, although not unique, is that it completely degrades over time and is absorbed by the body.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the key highlights of Trans-sodium crocetinate (TSC) and how it works in treating the condition of oxygen deprivation.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Cobuzzi:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Diffusion’s lead product candidate, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) has a novel mechanism of action. The compound was designed to treat hypoxia, defined as a non-physiologic level of tissue oxygen, which can lead to and complicate many familiar life-threatening conditions and diseases. These include trauma, heart attack, stroke, respiratory diseases (such as Covid-19), and tumor hypoxia – which is a primary factor leading to radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment resistance as well as increased metastatic potential.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Under normal physiologic conditions, oxygen transfer is highly efficient. However, under stressful conditions such as exercise or illness, the demand for oxygen delivery to the tissue often exceeds the supply. This means the efficiency with which oxygen diffuses from red blood cells to the target (hypoxic) tissue becomes a more important factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Multiple methods of treating hypoxia by augmenting oxygen delivery have been developed and are commonly used in modern medicine. These include mechanical methods to administer pure oxygen, improving cardiac output with medications and mechanical pumps, blood transfusions to supplement the supply of red blood cells, and the use of hormones to stimulate the production of red blood cells. All of these interventions can increase mass oxygen delivery in the body, but none of these interventions improve diffusion at the uptake or delivery points.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>TSC works by enhancing hydrogen bonding among water molecules in blood plasma, creating a more organized matrix that facilitates the passive diffusion of small molecules like oxygen (O2) and carbon monoxide (CO2) from areas of high concentration to areas of lower concentration. This mechanism of action improves the diffusion component of oxygen delivery through the blood in a manner that is independent of cardiac output, hemoglobin content, or oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin. Further, this passive diffusion process avoids over-oxygenating the body, where too much oxygen can itself cause tissue damage.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What drove Diffusion Pharma to develop such oxygen deprivation treatment therapy?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Cobuzzi:</strong>&nbsp;<em>TSC was designed and developed by Dr. John Gainer, who was a professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Virginia. Dr. Gainer was focused on identifying oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds to improve the treatment of hemorrhagic shock – low blood flow resulting in inadequate oxygen availability to tissue. This work was done under a grant from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and initially focused on a naturally occurring carotenoid called crocetin, derived from the spice saffron. Crocetin itself was not ideal, so Dr. Gainer and his lab worked to identify pharmacologically acceptable forms of crocetin, and in the process developed the synthetic analogue, TSC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In 2001, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals was formed. With the ONR grant money and private funding, the company set up a lab and worked with external collaborators to evaluate the use of TSC in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock and other hypoxic conditions, such as stroke and cancer.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What were the challenges Diffusion Pharma faced while developing TSC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Cobuzzi:</strong>&nbsp;<em>TSC development is still ongoing today. We are conducting what we have termed our Oxygenation Trials to determine the dose-response relationship between TSC and oxygenation in normal healthy volunteers and patients.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The company is small, and over the years it faced the most common challenge for early-stage biopharmaceutical companies: Obtaining adequate funding. A large amount of preclinical data has been generated by the Company, and early-stage clinical studies have been conducted evaluating the use of TSC in enhancing the standard of care treatment in peripheral artery disease, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; an aggressive form of brain cancer that is often hypoxic, leading to treatment resistance), acute stroke and more recently in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Across the clinical studies TSC was observed to be safe and well-tolerated, and there were signals of efficacy in all of the completed clinical studies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The COVID-19 study was also quite challenging – treating hospitalized patients during a pandemic for something other than the primary cause of their condition. Given the complexity of the study, operational challenges associated with enrolling patients internationally, and other factors, we made a strategic decision to end the study after the original 24 patients were enrolled and treated, and focused on the clinical development plan originally announced in November 2020. This was focused on optimizing the clinical dose and dosing frequency for TSC, including evaluating higher doses, to evaluate TSC in well-controlled and differentiated clinical models designed to establish proof of concept for improvement in oxygenation that we believe will position TSC as a platform therapeutic for hypoxia-related conditions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does TSC work in COVID hospitalized patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Cobuzzi:</strong>&nbsp;<em>In May 2021, we announced the final results of our COVID Trial, which was initiated in 2020 based upon the potential of TSC to improve low tissue oxygen levels in patients with COVID-19. The study’s primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TSC administered on a more frequent dosing regimen than we had previously tested in a clinical trial setting. The study tested doses of TSC ranging from 0.25 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg administered intravenously every six hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are pleased with the results of the study.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>TSC was found to be safe and well-tolerated when administered on a more frequent dosing regimen than previously tested in a clinical trial setting. Further, the study included secondary and exploratory endpoints to evaluate the efficacy, including time to improvement in World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale by day 7 and through day 29, time on oxygen supplementation, and hospital length of stay. Although this study was not specifically designed or powered to evaluate the efficacy, the study’s external safety monitoring committee observed that patients receiving the highest (1.5 mg/kg) dose of TSC had improved outcomes in the secondary and exploratory endpoints compared to those receiving lower doses of TSC. The clinical effects observed in patients afflicted with a complicated respiratory condition like COVID-19 provide further evidence of the therapeutic effects of TSC in indications complicated by hypoxia.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we discuss more about the interim results from the P-Ib study assessing TSC in hospitalized COVID patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Cobuzzi:</strong>&nbsp;<em>As noted, we are quite happy with the results of the Phase 1b COVID Trial.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This study was originally designed as a lead-in trial intended to obtain safety and dosing information to guide a larger, Phase 2b study. However, given the complexities encountered during the Phase 1b lead-in study and other factors, including the emphasis on the development and release of vaccines and a large number of antiviral therapy trials ongoing in the US and Europe, we turned our focus and resources to the execution of Oxygenation Trials announced in November 2020.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we know more about the other three clinical studies such as trial design, results (if any)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Cobuzzi:</strong>&nbsp;<em>In November 2020, we were a very new management team at Diffusion.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>So, we took the opportunity to conduct a thorough analysis of all available data to map our go-forward development strategy. The available data at that point supported TSC’s potential to enhance the standard of care for many hypoxia-related indications but did not yet provide direct evidence of TSC’s ability to enhance oxygenation in humans.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To address this gap, we announced plans to conduct a trilogy of short-term, clinical studies we collectively refer to as the Oxygenation Trials. These studies utilize three different experimental clinical models of oxygenation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The first of the Oxygenation Trials used transcutaneous oxygen monitoring (“TCOM”) technology to measure the direct effects of TSC on peripheral tissue oxygenation in healthy normal volunteers. Topline results from the TCOM Trial were reported in June 2021 and indicated increasing peripheral tissue oxygenation following TSC administration that persisted through the one-hour measurement period, particularly at the two highest doses tested (2.0 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg). Furthermore, TSC was safe and well-tolerated at all doses tested with no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities. Additionally, there was no evidence of hyperoxygenation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The second Oxygenation Trial has been named the Altitude Trial. We expect to initiate this study soon, in the fourth quarter of this year. It is designed to measure the effects of TSC on maximal oxygen consumption and partial pressure of blood oxygen in healthy normal volunteers exercising under conditions that simulate altitude and induce hypoxia.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The last of the planned Oxygenation Trials is what we call the ILD-DLCO Trial. We expect to initiate the ILD-DLCO study late in the fourth quarter of this year. This study is designed to measure the effects of TSC on the diffusion of carbon monoxide through the lungs (DLCO) as a surrogate measure of oxygen transfer efficiency, or uptake, from the alveoli of the lungs through the plasma and onto hemoglobin within red blood cells, in patients previously diagnosed with interstitial lung disease (ILD).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We believe the data we have obtained and expect to obtain from the Oxygenation Trials are very important, as we had relatively limited information on the dose-response relationship between TSC and oxygenation in either normal healthy volunteers or patients. Through the completion of our COVID-19 study last Spring, all of Diffusion’s completed clinical studies had been conducted in patients with complex conditions, such as peripheral artery disease and GBM. While we had preclinical data that showed there was a direct effect of TSC on oxygenation in multiple models, we did not have the equivalent human data. Since we believe TSC has the potential to be a platform therapeutic for a host of hypoxia-related conditions, we designed the Oxygenation Trials to specifically evaluate the effects of TSC in well-controlled and differentiated clinical models, each looking at a different aspect of oxygenation. The pharmacodynamic data from the Oxygenation Trials will guide the design of future studies and we believed this enhanced understanding will increase the probability of achieving successful study outcomes.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are more indications Diffusion Pharma is assessing and planning to assess/ test for TSC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Cobuzzi:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We are optimistic about the platform therapeutic potential of TSC. As noted, the Company previously has initiated studies in several different conditions where hypoxia is a complicating factor, including peripheral artery disease, cancer (GBM brain cancer), acute stroke, and COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We believe the remaining Oxygenation Trials will provide important additional data related to TSC dose and oxygenation as well as the mechanism of action. This includes data on the dose-response effects of TSC on peripheral oxygenation (TCOM Trial), oxygen availability and consumption under induced-hypoxic conditions (Altitude Trial), and the uptake of oxygen through the lungs (ILD-DLCO Trial). This information will supplement our selection of the initial TSC indication and dosing to be studied as we pursue a path to regulatory approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>While we get the remaining two Oxygenation Trials running, we are analyzing available data and discussing the next steps with our expert advisors so we can move quickly as we seek to pursue the most efficient path to approval with the highest probability of technical and regulatory success. We believe we owe that to both patients and shareholders.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss more about Diffusion’s pipeline?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Cobuzzi:</strong>&nbsp;<em>In addition to TSC, we have a second product candidate called DFN-529. This is a novel, allosteric inhibitor of the P13K/Akt/ mTOR (dual TORC1/TORC2) pathway, which is involved in the control of cell-cycle signaling and directly related to cellular proliferation and cancer. DFN 529 is in early-stage development. Two Phase 1 clinical trials were previously completed evaluating DFN-529 in age-related macular degeneration, and the FDA has granted Orphan Designation for DFN 529 in GBM for which preclinical studies have been conducted.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As discussed above, we believe TSC has the potential to be a platform therapeutic, or a pipeline in a product, that would be useful in many different indications.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We would like to explore all of these if possible, but time and money are the biggest limiting factors in any drug development program. Diffusion is a small company with limited resources, so TSC will remain the primary focus of our resources for the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Highlight the key features of positive top-line data of Dublin-3 registrational trial of plinabulin in combination with docetaxel to treat 2L and 3L treatment of NSCLC with EGFR wild type?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Dr. Trevor Feinstein:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>The key features of the positive topline data for plinabulin, a first-in-class selective immunomodulating microtubule-binding agent (SIMBA), in combination with docetaxel to treat 2nd and 3rd line EGFR wild type NSCLC included meeting the primary endpoint of significantly increasing overall survival (OS) for these cancer patients. In addition, overall survival was doubled for patients 24- and 36-months after treatment. The clinical trial also met key secondary endpoints including significantly reducing the incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia, which is a low count of neutrophils--a type of white blood cell, as well as improving overall response rate (p&lt;0.03) and progression-free survival(p&lt;0.01).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba<em>:&nbsp;</em>How will this drug transform the treatment for patients with NSCLC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Dr. Trevor Feinstein:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Plinabulin has the potential to transform treatment for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, an area of severe unmet medical need, as a new safe and tolerable therapeutic option that can dramatically increase the survival rate in patients. Currently, docetaxel-based therapies have limited survival benefits and very high rates of complications such as &gt;40% suffering from severe neutropenia. This combination therapy with plinabulin advances NSCLC patient care by significantly reducing severe neutropenia and allowing individuals to live longer without suffering as many adverse side effects, which is very meaningful to sick patients and their families. The success of this study proves the potential for plinabulin as a direct anti-cancer agent and supports the strategy of exploring its potential use in combination therapies for multiple tumor indications.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we talk about plinabulin as a product its MoA, ROA, what makes it different from other drugs of its class? How it works specifically for EGFRwt NSCLC and not other forms of NSCLC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Dr. Trevor Feinstein:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Plinabulin’s, a first-in-class selective immunomodulating microtubule-binding agent (SIMBA), has an MoA that is unique compared to other microtubule-binding agents due to its differentiated binding site on the microtubule. This unique binding site produces kinetics distinct from other similar agents but gives plinabulin great potential to help cancer patients in multiple different ways. As a result, clinical data have shown increased efficacy and safety in treating cancer, as seen with the recent NSCLC data.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the Phase 3 trial exploring plinabulin in combination with standard of care chemotherapy docetaxel in the treatment of NSCLC, the clinical trial protocol enrolled EGFR WT patients, which make up the bulk of NSCLC patients, and therefore that’s the population where there is data.&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""#_msocom_1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>[AB1]</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition, plinabulin promotes neutrophil survival providing a basis for its use in preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN). Plinabulin is given alongside chemotherapy via IV in week 1 along with G-CSFs, where it has been shown to help close the ‘neutropenia vulnerability gap’ in the first week of treatment cycles, as compared to the standard of care with GCSF which is not effective in reducing CIN until week two. A third important part of the plinabulin MOA is as a stimulator of dendritic cell maturation which helps immune cells increase antigen presentation, which would support plinabulin as a potentially critical part of a combination treatment strategy with immuno-oncology agents. At this year’s ASCO conference data supporting plinabulin as part of a triple-combination IO treatment (including an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy along with radiation/chemo) was presented and further studies are being performed to expand on these early findings.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the main features of plinabulin from which it gives immune-associated anti-cancer benefits &amp; in reducing severe neutropenia?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Dr. Trevor Feinstein:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Plinabulin is a selective immunomodulating microtubule-binding agent (SIMBA) that binds to ß-tubulin causing a release of the immune defense protein GEF-H1. This causes a dual-action maturation of dendritic cells and activation of T cells. These effects, in addition to the direct tumor-killing action of plinabulin, lead to dendritic cell and T-cell mediated tumor targeting and cause an increase in the secretion of IL-1. Upregulated IL-1 increases the number of LSK cells, causes maturation of neutrophils, and prevents the apoptosis of existing neutrophils. By increasing the number and preventing the loss of neutrophils, plinabulin helps prevent and combat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN).&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the plans regarding the approval of the therapy? After the US and China, what would be the targeted geographic locations?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Dr. Lan Huang:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>BeyondSpring is developing and initially commercializing treatments in two of the world’s largest markets, China and the United States, that will address the biggest clinical challenges and unmet needs in cancer care. We are open to commercializing our treatments in other markets globally and are committed to remaining transparent about those plans. The next targeted geographic location would be the EU and Japan.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our lead first-in-class asset, plinabulin, in combination with G-CSF, is currently undergoing regulatory review with breakthrough designation and priority review for potential approval in the U.S. and China for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN), with a U.S. PDUFA date of November 30, 2021.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition, in 1H 2022, the Company plans to apply for U.S. FDA and China NMPA approval for plinabulin in combination with docetaxel in NSCLC based on the demonstrated clinical benefit and safety profile.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the BeyondSpring plans to bring this drug to market for helping patients with NSCLC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Dr. Lan Huang:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Our commercial strategy has always been global at heart, we want to try and make any medicine we get approved available to as many patients in need as possible as quickly as is feasible. To support that we run large global registrational clinical trials with the intention of generating sufficient data for commercialization in multiple large markets. In the case of the DUBLIN-3, the trial was run in the U.S., China, and Australia. We are working to file NDA's in both the U.S. and China in NSCLC in 1H 2022 and will also work to bring access to additional markets in the future.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the other therapeutics areas in which BeyondSpring plans to seek treatment other than oncology?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Dr. Lan Huang:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>BeyondSpring is currently focused solely on the oncology space with first-in-class lead asset plinabulin, which is being developed as a “pipeline in a drug”.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition to being studied in CIN and lung cancer, plinabulin is also being studied as part of other regimens. This includes in combination with radiation and checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of a number of cancers. Lastly, BeyondSpring’s pipeline also includes three preclinical immuno-oncology assets and a subsidiary, SEED Therapeutics, that is leveraging a proprietary targeted protein degradation drug discovery platform.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you open to collaboration to advance your therapies?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Dr. Lan Huang:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We are always open to collaborating to help accelerate drug development and commercialization. We like to find synergy, which makes 1+1 &gt; 2. Our goal is always to bring transforming medicine to patients in a speedy manner, and in as many indications as possible in a timely manner, so patients can benefit quicker and plinabulin potentially has a wider reach. If a partner can help us do this better and faster, we are happy to collaborate.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: How did BeyondSpring make tremendous growth in oncology?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Dr. Lan Huang:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We are taking a science-driven approach to innovative drug development. As you see from our lead first in class asset Plinabulin’s journey, we discovered its immune mechanism from scratch, and then find the targeted patient populations to develop it properly, to target unmet medical needs. Cancer patients are always our “Northstar”; we develop differentiated medicine to help them.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are achieving such tremendous growth by targeting two of the largest oncology markets (US and China) with our first product candidate, plinabulin: a pipeline in a drug. Our development strategy for plinabulin, which includes advancing the agent for both prevention of CIN with a broad label targeting all non-myeloid solid cancer and all chemotherapy, as well as for direct cancer treatment with NSCLC as the lead indication, and in multiple cancer indications with IO combos.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To further increase our potential impact on the biggest clinical challenges and unmet needs in cancer care, we are developing and initially commercializing treatments in China, the fastest-growing global cancer market, and the United States, the largest market for cancer drug spending. </em></p>

<ul><li>The collaboration will expand AstraZeneca’s portfolio of targeted therapies for cancer &amp; other diseases.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the collaboration of Thermo Fisher with AstraZeneca to co-develop NGS-based CDx (deal terms, milestones, royalties, etc.)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Garret:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Thermo Fisher Scientific and AstraZeneca have signed a global, multi-year agreement to co-develop companion diagnostics to support AstraZeneca’s expanding portfolio of targeted therapies. Having companion diagnostics available as these therapies come to market will help enable access for more patients around the world.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What makes AstraZeneca an ideal partner to work with?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Garret:</strong>&nbsp;<em>AstraZeneca has already transformed countless patient lives through its leading oncology portfolio.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>With more than 90 percent of AstraZeneca’s clinical pipeline made up of targeted precision medicine therapies, they are helping drive the introduction of these therapies to the market. As we look to support broader genomic testing for patients, it makes sense for us to partner with a company that is equally committed to making these therapies available to patients.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Which therapy areas Thermo Fisher and AZ plans to target first &amp; what the basis of the selection (such as unmet need, market size, pricing, etc)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Garret:</strong>&nbsp;<em>This partnership will cover multiple diseases across AstraZeneca’s growing global portfolio of targeted precision medicines including oncology, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease, as well as metabolic and respiratory diseases. The first area we are exploring is oncology.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you planning to form an alliance with other global pharmaceuticals? Can we get insight into a few of them (if not in detail, but a glimpse)</strong>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Garret:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We are continuing to explore opportunities to partner with other global pharmaceutical companies to help ensure more patients can access new targeted therapies.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition to our partnership with AstraZeneca, this year we announced FDA approvals for companion diagnostics developed with&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.genomeweb.com/regulatory-news-fda-approvals/fda-clears-thermo-fisher-scientific-oncomine-assay-cdx-bile-duct"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Servier</em></a><em>&nbsp;for cholangiocarcinoma and&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.precisiononcologynews.com/sequencing/thermo-fisher-scientific-eli-lilly-develop-cdx-ret-inhibitor"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Eli Lilly</em></a><em><u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</u></em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/news/fda-thermo-fisher-cdx-nsclc/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Takeda</em></a><em>&nbsp;for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How is Thermo Fisher planning to harness the use of Precision medicine today and tomorrow?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Garret:</strong>&nbsp;<em>In the era of personalized medicine, molecular profiling has become essential for the treatment of cancer patients. With more genomic variations proving to be clinically relevant for matching patients with emerging targeted therapies, next-generation sequencing allows clinical labs to test for multiple alterations at once from a single, small amount of tissue.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We believe that everyone everywhere should have equal access to life-saving therapies. When available right away, genomic testing for disease helps unlock a broad array of targeted therapies. To realize this vision, we introduced the Ion Torrent Genexus System to simplify genomic testing so any hospital can provide clinically relevant next-generation sequencing (NGS) results in-house. It is the first automated NGS solution that delivers results economically in a single day, bringing us one step closer to a future where all cancer patients have access to precision medicine.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>It’s not hard to imagine how treatment for cancer, rare disease, and other conditions will change when the timing and precision of the diagnosis are no longer determined by where one lives, but instead by whether their unique cancer – be it a gene mutation, deletion or variation in their cancer – makes them a candidate for an existing therapy at the time when a biopsy is being tested with another standard of care technologies such immunohistochemistry.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In 2020 alone, the&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.personalizedmedicinecoalition.org/Userfiles/PMC-Corporate/file/PM_at_FDA_The_Scope_Significance_of_Progress_in_2020.pdf?_zs=02X7b&amp;_zl=ihuQ2"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>FDA approved 20 new personalized drugs and biologics</em></a><em>. As the industry continues to increase the numbers of newly available targeted therapies CDx development will be become a standard part of the development process As the pipeline for targeted therapies becomes larger, and countries establish new regulatory pathways to ensure access to these therapies, it is becoming increasingly important for pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies to work hand-in-hand to ensure access to precision medicine. Equity and early access can improve outcomes at a population level, and that’s what we’re driving toward.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you put some light on your globally distributed NGS CDx solution, the Oncomine Dx Target Test?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Garret:</strong>&nbsp;<em>The Oncomine Dx Target Test (ODxTT) is the first globally distributable NGS-based CDx and was the first targeted NGS-based in vitro diagnostic test for NSCLC. Since it was first introduced in 2015, Thermo Fisher has partnered with pharmaceutical companies leveraging the Oncomine Dx Target Test, receiving 12 approvals and registrations across 17 countries. This test has 12 targeted therapies on its label, helping identify patients who may benefit from pharmaceutical drug launches around the world. We are continuing to work with our pharmaceutical partners to the expanded clinical utility of the test; for example, we recently announced that it received FDA approval as a CDx for cholangiocarcinoma.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are also working with pharmaceutical partners to develop new CDx tests using the Oncomine Precision Assay, which runs on the Genexus System. The Oncomine Precision Assay is used to detect key biomarkers from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue or liquid biopsy specimen. The assay contains more than 50 cancer-related biomarkers and, when run on the Genexus System, features an automated workflow with a one-day turnaround time and the lowest sample requirements on the market for detection of both DNA and RNA variants.&nbsp;</em></p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we discuss the trial design &amp; results of VOYAGE in detail?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong>&nbsp;<em>VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 are important P-III, randomized, double-blind trials comparing TREMFYA® (guselkumab) with placebo and adalimumab in over 825 adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. The results showed patients treated with TREMFYA, a selective interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitor therapy, had greater improvements in the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe plaque PsO versus placebo and adalimumab based on Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 90 response and Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 at week 16. The post-hoc analyses we presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) also show that TREMFYA provided durable skin clearance responses and was well-tolerated for up to five years (week 252). With TREMFYA, the mean percentage improvement from baseline in PASI response at week 48 was 94% compared to 73.4% with adalimumab. At week 252, the mean percentage improvement from baseline in PASI response was 92.9% among patients who crossed over at week 48 from adalimumab to TREMFYA.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the trial design, patients were randomized to receive either placebo, TREMFYA, or adalimumab, with crossover from placebo taking place at weeks 16 and 20, and crossover from adalimumab occurring at week 52 in VOYAGE 1, and weeks 28-72 in VOYAGE 2. PASI 90 and IGA 0/1 were the co-primary endpoints of both studies. In VOYAGE 2, we conducted additional efficacy assessments that included proportions of patients achieving PASI 75, PASI 100, and IGA 0 (clear skin) responses, a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of 0/1, and a Psoriasis Signs and Symptoms Diary score of 0, as well as changes in baseline in SF-36, Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale, and the Work Limitations Questionnaire scores.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Let’s also discuss the trial design and results of the DISCOVER study in depth.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong>&nbsp;<em>DISCOVER-1 and -2 are Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA in over 1,900 adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The results showed that patients treated with TREMFYA had greater improvements in the signs and symptoms of active PsA, including joint and axial symptoms based on the American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR 20) response compared with placebo at week 24. TREMFYA treatment also resulted in lower mean scores for all six Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) components and greater improvements in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) compared with placebo through week 24 and as early as week 8, with similar mean scores at week 52 in patients with axial symptoms and sacroiliitis. TREMFYA was shown to have improved the signs and symptoms of active PsA regardless of patient baseline characteristics. TREMFYA treatment was well-tolerated through one year, with a safety profile in PsA that is consistent with the one established in the five-year Voyage 1 and 2 trials in PsO.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Both DISCOVER studies consisted of a screening phase of up to six weeks, a blinded treatment phase of 52 weeks in DISCOVER-1, and approximately 100 weeks in DISCOVER-2 that included a placebo-controlled period from week 0 to week 24 and a blinded active treatment period in the weeks following. They also included a safety follow-up phase through weeks 60 and 112, respectively. In each study, multiple other clinical outcomes were assessed in addition to ACR20, including ACR50/70, resolution of soft tissue inflammation, enthesitis and dactylitis, improvement in physical function, skin clearance (IGA score), and general health outcomes (SF-36 Physical Component Summary [PCS] and Mental Component Summary [MCS] scores).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is Janssen assessing Tremfya in H2H comparison with other competitors like Cosentyx, Humira?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We are focused on capturing the most useful data for our therapies in PsO and PsA that can help providers understand how treatment can work for patients. In addition to the head-to-head data from the VOYAGE study with adalimumab, we have also conducted ECLIPSE, a Phase 3, multicenter, 56-week, double-blinded, active-comparator study of TREMFYA versus secukinumab in 1,048 patients with moderate to severe PsO. At week 48, numerically greater proportions of patients achieved PASI 90 or PASI 100 and an IGA score of 0 or 0/1 with TREMFYA versus secukinumab, indicating completely clear or almost clear skin. These responses with TREMFYA were seen regardless of baseline age, body weight, body mass index, disease severity, body region, and prior medication – all of which are important to understand, as varying characteristics might affect a patient’s response to treatment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why did Janssen choose to do an H2H study with Humira only? Is there any specific reason?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Following our approach to investigate the underlying pathways of immune disease, we are continuing to evaluate TREMFYA as a first-in-class IL-23 inhibitor therapy so that we can work to bring more effective treatments to patients with immune-mediated diseases. In this process, we evaluated TREMFYA against an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha agent. We will continue to conduct comparative and head-to-head studies to help provide a clear data picture of available options to prescribers and patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you please tell our readers about PASI score? What is it and its significance?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong>&nbsp;<em>The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score is a measure of the amount of surface area covered by PsO plaques in each body region, as well as the degree of plaque redness, thickness, and scaliness. It is a way for physicians to assess the severity of a patient’s PsO, as well as the efficacy of a treatment in reducing these difficult symptoms. PASI 75/90/100 responses are defined as at least 75/90/100 percent improvement in the PASI score from baseline. Clinicians also use Absolute PASI as a reference for symptom assessment, with the achievement of an absolute PASI score lower than 2 or 3 as a proposed indication of treatment success. A score greater than 5 usually indicates that an alteration of treatment is needed. TREMFYA is the first-in-class IL-23 inhibitor to establish efficacy and safety through five years in PsO, with complete skin clearance rates maintained at five years in a majority of patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How is Tremfya better than Humira in terms of providing a better quality of life?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong>&nbsp;<em>PsO can have a significant impact on a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Data from an analysis of VOYAGE 1 presented at EADV demonstrated the correlation between skin clearance and improved HRQoL measures among people living with moderate to severe PsO. The data showed that the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) response mirrored PASI improvement, with 87.5% of TREMFYA patients with sustained skin clearance (PASI 0 for three years or more) reporting a DLQI score of 0 or 1 after 76 weeks of treatment. Overall, these VOYAGE data show TREMFYA is seen to improve both clinical and QoL scores and to maintain these improvements over time.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does this new data change the market dynamics in PsO &amp; PsA therapy area?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong>&nbsp;<em>TREMFYA is the first and only selective IL-23 inhibitor therapy approved in the U.S. to treat both adults with moderate to severe plaque PsO who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, as well as adults with active PsA. These data reinforce TREMFYA as a therapeutic option that targets a central disease-driving mechanism of action for patients impacted by PsO and PsA.</em></p>

Post,PharmaShots Interview: Genmab’s Jan van de Winkel Shares Insight on the Tivdak (tisotumab vedotin-tftv) for the Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Jan van de Winkel, co-founder, President, and CEO at Genmab</strong> shared his views on the<strong> US FDA’s Accelerated Approval </strong>of<strong> Tivdak (tisotumab vedotin-tftv)</strong> for the Treatment of<strong> Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Genmab and Seagen have reported the US FDA’s accelerated approval which is based on the P-II innovaTV 204 clinical trials evaluating tisotumab vedotin in 101 patients with r/mCC who had received no more than two prior systemic regimens in the recurrent or metastatic setting, including one prior Pt-based CT regimen</li><li>The results showed an ORR (24%) as assessed by IRC, m-DoR (8.3mos.)</li><li>Tivdak is the 1st approved ADC which is directed to TF &amp; Seagen’s ADC technology utilizes a protease-cleavable linker &amp; covalently attaches the microtubule-disrupting agent MMAE to Ab. The P-III innovaTV 301clinical trial of Tivdak is underway that is intended to support global registrations</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can we first talk about Tivdak, MoA, ROA, frequency, dosing, and its target?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jan van de Winkel: </strong><em>The approval of Tivdak is a milestone moment for women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy. It is a first-of-its-kind treatment that has demonstrated positive efficacy in clinical trials with durable responses and a well-tolerated safety profile in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Tivdak is an antibody-drug conjugate, often referred to as an ADC, that is directed to tissue factors. In cancer biology, tissue factor is a cell-surface protein that is associated with tumor growth, the formation of new blood vessels, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Tissue factor is prevalent in several solid tumors, including cervical cancer. Based on its elevated expression in multiple solid tumors, its rapid internalization, and compelling preclinical models, we selected tissue factor as a target for an ADC approach. Tivdak is Seagen’s third FDA-approved antibody-drug conjugate, and at Genmab it is our first U.S. FDA-approved medicine.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the pivotal Phase 2 innovaTV, 204 study with 101 patients treated with TIVDAK, the median duration of treatment was 4.2 months. The median number of cycles patients received was 6. The recommended dose of Tivdak is 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg for patients &gt;100 kg) administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Results from the trial showed a 24 percent confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (95% CI; 15.9-33.3), as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. The median duration of response (DOR) was 8.3 months (95% CI; 4.2 to not reached).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Tivdak is approved for intravenous infusion only and should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. Tivdak should not be mixed with, or administered as an infusion with, other medicinal products.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Please tell us about the innovaTV 204 trial and its eligibility criteria.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jan van de Winkel</strong><em>: The accelerated approval of Tivdak was based on the innovaTV 204 clinical trial in which it was evaluated in patients who had received no more than two prior systemic regimens in the recurrent or metastatic setting, including at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients were excluded if they had an active ocular surface disease, any prior episode of cicatricial conjunctivitis, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Grade =2 peripheral neuropathy, or known coagulation defect leading to an increased risk of bleeding.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As reported at ESMO 2020, key secondary endpoints from the innovaTV 204 trial included duration of response, time to response, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, complete response, and tolerability. In the Phase 2 innovaTV 204 trial, Tivdak was well-tolerated and manageable with most adverse reactions being mild to moderate, including peripheral neuropathy, ocular, and bleeding events.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Could you tell us briefly about the core opinions of the data presented at ESMO?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jan van de Winkel</strong><em>: We were very pleased with our data presence at ESMO. The data presented this year at the conference was from innovaTV 205, a different study than the innovaTV 204 study that supported Tivdak’s approval. In innovaTV 205, tisotumab vedotin in combination with carboplatin showed encouraging and durable anti-tumor activity as potential first-line treatment regimen with 55% objective response rate (ORR), and tisotumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab showed encouraging, durable anti-tumor activity in previously treated patients with 38% ORR. Interim results from the innovaTV 205 study demonstrate the potential for tisotumab vedotin in combination with currently used anti-cancer agents as treatment options for patients with advanced cervical cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How was the journey of gaining the US FDA’s approvals for Tivdak? Were there any roadblocks?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jan van de Winkel</strong><em>: The approval of Tivdak signifies our first step towards achieving our 2025 vision of transforming cancer treatment through our own innovative products. Tivdak represents the maturity of Genmab’s pipeline development and the growth of our organization as we work to make a difference in the treatment of people with cancer. Tivdak is being co-developed by Genmab and Seagen, under an agreement in which the companies share costs and profits for the product on a 50:50 basis.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Prior to the approval of Tivdak, women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer faced limited treatment options available to them once the disease has progressed beyond chemotherapy and no standard of care. Tivdak is helping to address an unmet need for more treatment options in this disease area.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What was the major supporting element in receiving the US FDA’s accelerated approval?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jan van de Winkel</strong><em>: The strength of the data, along with the drive of a large unmet need both went into supporting Tivdak’s approval by the FDA. The results of the Phase 2 innovaTV 204 clinical trial demonstrate clinically meaningful, durable responses with a well-tolerated safety profile for patients with a disease that has limited treatment options. In clinical studies, Tivdak has demonstrated clinically meaningful and durable antitumor activity, rapid time to response, and a well-tolerated safety profile in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the recommended doses for Tivdak?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jan van de Winkel</strong><em>: The recommended dose of Tivdak is 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg for patients &gt;100 kg) administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tivdak is approved for intravenous infusion only and should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. It should not be mixed with, or administered as an infusion with, other medicinal products.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What will be the Company’s commercialization strategies for Tivdak?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Jan van de Winkel</strong><em>: Our 1st priority is to continue our work with our partner Seagen towards the successful launch of TV, now that we received FDA approval. We have a fully trained field team in place (across OAMs &amp; MSLs) to launch TV in m/r CC with Seagen. We also have a robust launch plan in place to ensure broad awareness and adoption of TV upon approval. As we build our capabilities in commercialization, I continue to be impressed with the caliber, experience, and top-tier talent we continue to attract from top oncology companies to join our team.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Please comment about the expected progress of Tivdak’s ongoing trials for various other indications.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jan van de Winkel</strong><em>: We are deeply committed to helping patients with cancer, and in addition to recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, we believe that there may be other opportunities for Tivdak. Tissue factor is expressed in a variety of tumors including (in addition to cervical and ovarian cancers) lung, head &amp; neck, esophageal, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, many of which are difficult to treat.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In January 2021, we announced the initiation of the innovaTV 301 trial, a phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy of Tivdak compared to chemotherapy in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. This trial is intended to serve as a confirmatory trial for the US and is intended to support global regulatory applications</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Tuba: What are the possible side effects of Tivdak?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jan van de Winkel</strong><em>: In the innovaTV 204 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of treatment with Tivdak, ocular adverse reactions occurred in 60% of patients with cervical cancer. Grade 3 ocular adverse reactions occurred in 3.8% of patients, including severe ulcerative keratitis in 3.2% of patients. The most common were conjunctival adverse reactions, dry eye, corneal adverse reactions, and blepharitis. In some cases, Tivdak caused changes in the corneal epithelium and conjunctiva resulting in changes in vision, including severe vision loss, and corneal ulceration.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>I recommend carefully reading the prescribing information for more background on dosing and the boxed warning which states Tivdak caused changes in the corneal epithelium and conjunctiva resulting in changes in vision, including severe vision loss, and corneal ulceration. Conduct an ophthalmic exam at baseline, prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Adhere to premedication and required eye care before, during, and after infusion. Withhold Tivdak until improvement and resume, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue, based on severity.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How are you planning to overcome the risk of ocular adverse reactions related to its administration?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jan van de Winkel</strong><em>: Genmab, along with our Seagen partner, are committed to developing therapies that offer meaningful treatment outcomes with patient safety in mind. During clinical trials, we found that ocular adverse reactions associated with Tivdak were manageable with consistent implementation of the required eye care, working closely with oncology care teams and eye care professionals.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We have taken careful consideration of the patient experience to better understand how we can support healthcare practitioners and patients at numerous touchpoints throughout the treatment journey and help minimize any barriers to adherence.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To support required eye care and reduce barriers to treatment, patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals will be provided with educational resources and services. Financial assistance programs and referral support for an eye care provider can be accessed through Seagen Secure® (SGS), a patient services hub.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Christopher J. Calhoun:</strong><em>&nbsp;Paracrine is a biopharmaceutical company that is currently developing the world’s first device-based, autologous cell therapy platform that is focused on late-stage clinical trials for some of the greatest unmet needs in healthcare today.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>With 20 years of development and upwards of $400 million invested into this technology, the design, engineering, and manufacturing of the Celution System, as well as the basic science, pre-clinical studies, and extensive clinical development work have all been completed. This positions us to entirely focus on executing pivotal (e.g., approval) trials to rapidly get this to market and the patients in need.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>An estimated 8,000 to 10,000 people have already been treated with Paracrine’s Celution System worldwide, including 80 investigator-led studies and 9 sponsored clinical trials.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This not only provides tremendous confidence that the therapy is safe but it provides valuable insight into how it’s working; what indications it’s working in, and most importantly, where it may not yet be working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Building on this knowledge and all our clinical experience, we are now advancing three late-stage trials with a high probability of success.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the Paracrine procedure?</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Christopher J. Calhoun:<em><u>&nbsp;</u></em></strong><em>This is an easy 3-step process.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>First, a small amount of fat– half a can of coke worth, is removed from the belly or thighs of a patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Second, it is then processed in the Celution System via a single-use consumable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Third, the patient’s rich population of stem and regenerative cells are ready to be delivered back to the patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-full is-resized""><img src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-1.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-66437"" width=""428"" height=""215"" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why Fat?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Christopher J. Calhoun:&nbsp;</strong>Adipose Tissue (fat) is well known as the body’s “energy storage” department. Recently, the role and importance of adipose tissue have been expanded and adipose tissue is now recognized as&nbsp;<strong><u>the body’s largest endocrine organ</u></strong>, secreting more than 600 different proteins, hormones, peptides, and cytokines - called&nbsp;<strong>“Adipokines”</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adipokines are essentially chemical messages or instructions—that is, a way for cells to communicate with each other. We call this the Language of Healing. These molecules participate through paracrine and&nbsp;<em>endocrine “cross-talk” in a great variety of physiological processes, thereby regulating numerous biological functions including the immune system, inflammation, and vascular function (among many others).&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Whereas endocrine communications are generally thought of as long-distance calls—typically using the vascular system to transport messages—</em><strong><em>Paracrine</em></strong><em>&nbsp;signals are short-distance communications typically between cells that are local. ADRCs likely employ both endocrine and paracrine signaling, with an emphasis on paracrine—or local, messaging and cross-talk.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Furthermore, adipose has also recently been described as&nbsp;</em><strong><em><u>the body’s most active immune organ</u></em></strong><em>. Adipose Tissue contains all types of immune cells including approximately 30% of the body’s regulatory T-Cells (Tregs). Approximately a quarter of the ADRCs in Paracrine Cell Therapy are macrophages.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Macrophages are best known for a classical pro-inflammatory phenotype and secretion of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), which has a reputation as one of the more notorious pro-inflammatory cytokines. But, macrophages have the unique ability to flip or “polarize” into an opposing M2 phenotype. So, the M2 macrophage secretes immunosuppressive factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-1Ra result in a reduction of IL-6. The majority of macrophages in adipose tissue are M2 phenotype and are likely responsible for the beneficial anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects we have documented in clinical and pre-clinical studies with ADRCs.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Therefore, ADRC’s amplify the body’s innate ability to heal itself through dynamic signaling (cross-talk) that reduces inflammation, suppresses the immune system, improves local blood flow &amp; vascular structures, and repairs damaged tissue.</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This is the world’s first 3-in-1 cell therapy: Vascular Therapy, Immunotherapy, and Regenerative Therapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is cell therapy’s role in treating diabetes-related complications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;Christopher J. Calhoun:&nbsp;</strong><em>The common pathology behind many diabetes complications starts with endothelial dysfunction, which leads to micro and macrovascular damage and more specifically – local tissue ischemia (or impaired blood flow), global and localized inflammation, and subsequently, tissue damage. This creates a negative spiral of progressive disease which worsens over time. This can also be accelerated by an event such as a stroke or a heart attack which triggers the spiral of progressive disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Paracrine Cell Therapy is ideally positioned to address conditions with these common underlying integers. Unlike most drug therapy which typically targets a single mechanism of action and focus on symptoms (block the pain receptor and your headache goes away for a while), our cells respond dynamically to the local environmental cues, addressing each of the core structural issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Initially, the cells respond to the local ischemia by releasing various pro-angiogenic factors that repair or rebuild necessary vascular structures to improve the local blood flow. Then they begin to suppress the local immune system and down-regulate inflammation – that is, switching from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory positioning. Finally, they recruit and direct the rebuilding and remodeling of tissue that has been damaged. This restores function and may alleviate chronic symptoms like pain or heal otherwise non-healing wounds.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Complex conditions such as these require dynamic (biologic) multi-modality therapy. In other words, a silver bullet just isn’t going to work. By addressing the underlying structural issues, Paracrine effectively changes the pathophysiology, breaking the spiral of progressive disease</em>.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are Paracrine’s future plans?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Christopher J. Calhoun:&nbsp;</strong><em>My number one job is to get the clinical data needed by the FDA to gain approval as quickly as possible, to bring this important technology to many patients who need advanced therapy. We are focusing and resourcing the company exclusively around this core mission.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What’s different about Paracrine is the overwhelming amount of clinical data and experience that we already possess. This makes my job easier since we can select multiple indications with the highest probability of success and in parallel, significantly mitigate any clinical risks.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Keep in mind this does not mean targeting low-risk or inconsequential indications. We are targeting one of the leading causes of death in the ATHENA III Heart Failure Trial; the leading cause of hospitalizations of diabetics in the ASCEND Non-Healing Diabetic Foot Ulcer Trial, and the STAR II Trial we are currently treating the debilitating hand dysfunction due to scleroderma, a rare autoimmune rheumatic disorder that has confounded scientists for decades.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>For each trial, we are working with the topmost clinical specialists in the field, a fact of which I am very proud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Each of these indications shares a common underlying pathology including ischemia (impaired blood flow), inflammation, and tissue damage making them ideal targets for Paracrine’s “3-in-1” therapy.&nbsp; &nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>One more interesting point is in all of these trials, and more broadly in nearly all of the patients treated to date globally, is that this is a “one and done” therapy. Meaning, the patient needs only to be treated one time.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What makes Paracrine so cost-effective on the business end, and affordable for the patient?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Christopher J. Calhoun:&nbsp;</strong><em>Unlike many of the engineered therapies or allogenic cell therapies that typically require sophisticated and expensive manufacturing processes, Paracrine’s Cell Therapy is produced in real-time using the Celution System. This enables a per-patient price point in the $6,000 (non-vascular) to $9,000 (vascular) range and provides a clear pharmacoeconomic benefit to patients, physicians, and payers.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How has the capital raise process been for Paracrine in the past, and what is in store for the future?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Christopher J. Calhoun:&nbsp;</strong><em>This month, Paracrine is launching our Series A financing to bring in the necessary capital to fund the company and importantly, our clinical pipeline. Our laser-focused plan and extensive clinical experience, coupled with world-class clinical leadership in each of our trials and a lean, talented management team, distinguishes Paracrine as one of the most attractive investment opportunities in its field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Any plans on collaborations in the future?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Christopher J. Calhoun:&nbsp;</strong><em>Ischemia, inflammation, and tissue injury are common within many diseases and conditions, making our platform highly scalable across diverse therapeutic markets. Collaborations and partnerships are an essential part of our broader vision to expand and advance our clinical pipeline as well as to accelerate and broaden our reach into the market as we move closer to approval. Everything we do is a collaboration of sorts.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Tell us more about NVG-291. Discuss its key features, MoA, and its working principle on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paul Brennan:</strong><em>&nbsp;NVG-291 originated from the research of Dr. Jerry Silver at Case Western Reserve University. Dr. Silver and his team identified chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (“CSPGs”) as playing a key role in inhibiting repair following nervous system injury. In collaboration with researchers at Harvard University, Dr. Silver and his team also identified protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (“PTPs”) as the receptor through which CSPGs inhibit nervous system repair. His research team then identified a series of peptidic modulators that block CSPG signaling through the receptor, which enables neural repair and functional improvement in animal models. NVG-291 is a very close analog of one of the peptidic modulators identified.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The key features of NVG-291, and NervGen’s drug development program focusing on PTPs, are:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>our peptides are the only technology in a company that NervGen is aware of that is being developed to target the PTPs-CSPG mechanism; modulation of the receptor has multiple pharmacodynamic effects which include enhanced plasticity, axonal regeneration, and remyelination; and</em></li><li><em>we have demonstrated functional improvement in six different disease models, crossing the major neurological functions (fine and gross motor function, sensory function, autonomic function, and cognitive function).&nbsp;</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Mechanism of Action - Following an acute injury to the nervous system, such as spinal cord injury (“SCI”), or because of chronic neurodegenerative diseases in the central nervous system (“CNS”), such as multiple sclerosis (“MS”) or Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”), there is a dramatic upregulation in the CNS of a class of molecules called CSPGs. In the short term, CSPGs play a role in containing damage; however, chronically CSPGs inhibit CNS repair mechanisms, including axon regeneration, plasticity, and remyelination. PTPs was identified as the predominant receptor through which CSPGs mediate their inhibitory effect. NVG-291 is a peptide mimetic that attenuates the inhibitory signaling that would otherwise have been caused by CSPGs binding to PTPs. Functional efficacy has been demonstrated in animal models of MS, SCI, optic neuritis, cardiac arrythmia associated with heart attack, peripheral nerve injury, and stroke. CSPGs have been shown to be upregulated around sites of CNS damage in several diseases in humans, including AD, MS, and SCI.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Highlight your ongoing P-I trial &amp; its design.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paul Brennan:</strong><em>&nbsp;Our Phase 1 study is currently being conducted on healthy volunteers. The objective of the study is to determine the side effect profile of NVG-291, the maximum dose at which NVG-291 is well tolerated, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of NVG-291, and to set the dose for the subsequent trials in patients. The study is a two-part, triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Part one of the study was the single ascending dose (“SAD”) portion, which has now been completed. Pending successful review of the SAD data by the ethics review committee, NervGen will proceed to the second part of the study, which is the multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) portion, where subjects will be dosed with NVG-291 once a day for 14 consecutive days. The study is being conducted under a partial clinical hold by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) as they await results from additional preclinical studies that have been requested. Under the partial clinical hold, the SAD portion of the study is limited to females and the MAD portion of the study will be conducted in post-menopausal females. Following completion of the preclinical studies requested by the FDA, NervGen intends to apply to the FDA to remove the partial clinical hold and will then conduct bridging studies in healthy volunteers to include males and premenopausal females.&nbsp;</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Discuss in detail about clinical/preclinical results of NVG-291.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paul Brennan:</strong><em>&nbsp;NVG-291 has been studied in multiple in vitro and in vivo studies, showing functional benefits in animal models of SCI, peripheral nerve injury, MS, optic neuritis, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction. The results in each of the models are as follows:&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li><em>Spinal cord injury: In rat models of SCI, in which animals were treated with a subcutaneous (“s.c.”) dose once a day for 7 weeks, statistically significant improvements compared to control animals were seen in fine and gross motor function, sensory function (pain and temperature) and autonomic function (bladder control). In some cases, the amount of recovery was dramatic, including some animals that almost improved to full motor function following severe injury (Lang et al., Nature, 2015; Rink, S. et al., Experimental Neurology 309, 148–159 (2018)).&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Peripheral nerve injury: In rat models of peripheral nerve injury, in which animals were treated with an s.c. dose once a day for 3, 6, or 12 weeks, statistically significant improvements compared to control animals were seen in motor function, motoneuron survival and regeneration, as well as a reduction in muscle atrophy and a reduction in electromyography abnormalities (Li, H. et al., Scientific Reports, 5, 1–14. (2015); Lv, S.Q. et al., Neural Regen Res, 16, 1598. (2021)).&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Multiple sclerosis: In MS models, where myelin in the spinal cord has been damaged with a detergent, lysophosphatidylcholine (“LPC”), animals treated with NVG-291 have a more rapid and complete recovery of myelin compared to non-treated animals. The recovery in myelin is accompanied by a restoration of nerve conductance. In the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, NVG-291 treatment initiated either at symptom onset or when symptoms are fully developed promoted functional recovery in motor control (Luo, F. et al., Nature Communications, 9, 1–16. (2018)).&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Optic neuritis: Following lysolecithin/ LPC lesion of the optic chiasm, mice treated with an s.c. dose once daily for 3, 7, or 14 days showed statistically significant improvements in in-depth perception and enhanced visual signal conductance, as well as increased remyelination compared to control (Niknam, P. et al., Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, 99, 103391. (2019)).</em></li><li><em>Stroke: In the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) mouse model of stroke, animals treated with NVG-291 once daily for 28 days showed statistically significant enhanced axonal sprouting around the lesion and in the spinal cord, along with statistically significant improvements in spatial learning and memory, and in sensory and motor function (unpublished data provided by Dr. Agnes Luo, University of Cincinnati).&nbsp; &nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Myocardial infarction: In a mouse model of acute myocardial infarction, in which animals were treated with an intraperitoneal dose of NVG-291 once a day for 11 days, statistically significant sympathetic reinnervation of the heart lesion was observed along with higher levels of norepinephrine in the lesion of treated animals compared to control. A statistically significant reduction in arrhythmias was also seen in treated animals compared to control (Gardner, R.T. et al., Nature Communications, 6, 6235. (2015)).&nbsp; &nbsp;</em></li></ol>

<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>What makes NVG-291 different from other drugs in development in neurological disorders?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paul Brennan:</strong><em>&nbsp;There are multiple factors that differentiate NVG-291 from other drugs in development for neurological disorders.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>NVG-291’s mechanism of action works through repairing and restoring neurological function. Most other drugs in development in the CNS space are focused on slowing the progression of the disease, and most neurological diseases are very slowly progressing. With this differentiated approach, we should see a quicker response, and that response should be seen with fewer patients.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Whereas most drugs in development have only one pharmacodynamic response, NVG-291 has a multi-modal mechanism of response (axon regeneration, increased plasticity, remyelination).&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>The scope, pattern, and magnitude of response seen in functional studies with NVG-291 are broad and deep compared to other products in development. For example, firstly, NervGen believes it has the potential to be effective in any disorder where there is damage to the nervous system, whether acute or chronic. Secondly, NVG-291 demonstrates pharmacological activity across the major neurological functions (autonomic function, sensory function, cognition, and motor control). And thirdly, in some experiments, such as SCI, the magnitude of response seen with NVG-291 treatment has never been seen before.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Are you planning to explore the potential of NVG-291 beyond neurodegenerative diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paul Brennan:</strong><em>&nbsp;NervGen believes that NVG-291 has the potential to be used any time there is damage to the nervous system, either as a result of trauma or neurodegenerative disease. Efficacy has been demonstrated in animal models of MS, SCI, optic neuritis, cardiac arrythmia associated with heart attack, peripheral nerve injury, and stroke. We are initially focusing our efforts on MS, AD, and SCI.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Highlight the NervGen efforts in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Any more molecules planned to be assessed for the same indication?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paul Brennan:</strong><em>&nbsp;We are initially focusing our efforts on MS, AD, and SCI with NVG-291. In the future, we will look at alternate formulations and modes of administration of NVG-291 for different indications, as well as alternate molecules with the same mechanism.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>What are NervGen’s other programs in a pipeline to help patients overcome their disease and live a better life?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paul Brennan:</strong><em>&nbsp;For now, we are focusing on NVG-291 in MS, AD, and SCI.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Are you open to collaborations to advance the development and commercialization of NVG-291 globally?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paul Brennan:</strong><em> Currently we are not actively pursuing collaborations. However, as we progress into more clinical trials and indications, we will consider a partnership if the right circumstances present themselves (those being a partnership that provides value for the compound in development and the shareholders of NervGen). </em></p>
