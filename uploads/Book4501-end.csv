<p align=""justify"">INCHEON, Korea, Sept. 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. today announced results from a post-hoc and subgroup analysis of Phase 3 clinical study of BYOOVIZ™ (ranibizumab biosimilar) identifying the baseline factors associated with visual acuity and anatomical outcomes at both primary endpoints through week 52. The study results will be presented at the EURETINA 2021 Virtual Congress as an e-poster with voice recording.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“This post-hoc analysis of a Phase 3 study presented at EURETINA 2021 demonstrates important baseline factors that determine efficacy outcomes of nAMD treatment,” said Donghoon Shin, Vice President and Medical and Lifecycle Safety Team Leader at Samsung Bioepis. “Additional subgroup analysis showed that there was no difference between BYOOVIZ and the reference ranibizumab in week 52 visual outcomes in many different subgroups, and this result further supports biosimilarity between BYOOVIZ and reference ranibizumab. This goes to show that BYOOVIZ is an effective and a valuable treatment option for nAMD patients worldwide”.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In the study, a total of 634 patients whose median (min, max) age was 75 (51, 96) years, were randomized to receive monthly 0.05 mL intravitreal injections of either 0.5 mg BYOOVIZ™ or 0.5 mg reference ranibizumab. The primary endpoints were change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at week 8 and change in central subfield thickness (CST) at week 4 with both endpoints then followed through week 52. Associations between baseline factors and treatment responses of BCVA and CST at week 52 were assessed by linear regression analyses, then multivariable analysis on baseline factors that were identified to have a pre-specified P value of &lt;0.001.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Additionally, a subgroup analysis based on associated baseline factors was conducted on week 52 change from baseline for BCVA outcomes. The study demonstrated that the baseline age, BCVA, CST, and total lesion size were identified to be associated with visual acuity and anatomical outcomes when managing nAMD with BYOOVIZ™ or reference ranibizumab. The similar visual outcomes of the two products in the change from baseline in BCVA in many different subgroups further support the equivalent clinical efficacy.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The details of the study are available on EURETINA 2021 virtual website <a title=""here"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jmlUO0dM1MF5x5cclJZScD-80_v5SL2GzkV9w0FVbimdgEJO6oMlRYohyDIiAi3FvW_2m4TIqp0T6KIfNxcNj5GtoPYqepqxw2btnQMoF4s3_Lq1mRCAxVQVjQQO3CDx-0ES2tN0Csny0CfZKC3ce9vgEss8iEr6u8MmwU7dgXXRfcGAjf93y06pAeHkv4TE"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">here</a>.</p>
<p align=""justify"">BYOOVIZ™ has been approved by the European Commission as of August 2021, and will add to the biosimilars portfolio developed by Samsung Bioepis and commercialized by Biogen including BENEPALI™, IMRALDI™ and FLIXABI™ which achieved anti-TNF market leadership in the combined pharmaceutical market in Europe.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><u>BYOOVIZ™ Post-hoc and Subgroup Analysis
</u></strong>To provide additional confidence regarding the equivalency of BYOOVIZ™ (SB11), the results of a post-hoc analysis was undertaken to identify baseline factors associated with visual acuity and anatomical outcomes in BYOOVIZ™ vs rRBZ (reference ranibizumab), specifically optical coherence tomography (OCT) central subfield thickness (CST) at week 52, as well as a subgroup analysis based on baseline factors judged relevant. A total of 634 patients participated in a randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, multicenter, 52-week phase 3 clinical trial(SB11: n=307; rRBZ: n=327), whose median (min, max) age was 75 (51, 96) years.</p>
<p align=""justify"">From a post-hoc regression analysis, baseline age, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and total lesion size were associated with mean change from baseline improvement in BCVA at week 52. Similarly, baseline age, BCVA and CST were associated with reduction in mean change from baseline CST at week 52. For every year of participant age, the mean change from baseline BCVA improvement was reduced by 0.19 letters (95% CI, -0.29 to -0.08; P&lt;0.001) and CST showed additional thickness reduction by 1.26 µm (95% CI, -1.87 to -0.66; P&lt;0.001). For every 1 letter increment of BCVA at baseline, the mean BCVA improvement was reduced by 0.22 letters (95% CI, -0.31 to -0.14; P &lt;.001). For every 1 µm increment of baseline CST, CST showed additional thickness reduction by 0.71 µm (95% CI, -0.76 to -0.66; P&lt;0.001). Overall, the subgroup analysis of change from baseline in BCVA by associated baseline factors showed comparable treatment effects within each subgroup between BYOOVIZ™ and rRBZ across important baseline characteristics, supporting the robustness of the previously reported primary and secondary outcomes.</p>

<strong>Basel, September 13, 2021</strong> — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) for anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor tislelizumab for the treatment of unresectable recurrent locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in people who had received prior systemic therapy.

""This is an encouraging step forward in our mission to deliver transformative therapies for people living with cancer, and especially for people with esophageal cancer, an aggressive disease with limited treatment options,"" said Jeff Legos, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Oncology &amp; Hematology Development. “We are advancing tislelizumab as a key cornerstone of our immunotherapy program and PD-1 backbone for combination therapy. We will work with regulatory authorities to ensure it is available for people with esophageal cancer as soon as possible.”

Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody being developed both as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies.<sup>4</sup> The BLA submission was based on data from the Phase III RATIONALE 302 trial, which demonstrated a 30% reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85, p=0.0001) and extended median overall survival by 2.3 months compared to chemotherapy in people with unresectable recurrent locally advanced or metastatic ESCC who had received prior systemic therapy.<sup>1</sup>

<strong>About Esophageal Cancer</strong>
ESCC is the most common type of esophageal cancer globally and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.<sup>2</sup> There are approximately 17,000 people living with ESCC in the United States and in 2021, and it is estimated that there will be 19,000 new esophageal cancer cases diagnosed and more than 15,000 deaths from esophageal cancer.<sup>3</sup><sup>,5</sup> Globally, in 2020, there were more than 604,000 new cases of esophageal cancer and 544,000 deaths from esophageal cancer.<sup>2</sup> More than two-thirds of people with ESCC have advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.<sup>6</sup> The five-year survival rate for esophageal cancer is 19.9%, and the five-year survival rate for metastatic disease is even lower at 5.2%.<sup>3</sup>

<strong>About Tislelizumab</strong>
Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc?R on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to Fc?R on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. The clinical impact of these features is not yet known.<sup>4</sup>

BeiGene filed the BLA on behalf of Novartis in the United States for tislelizumab for the treatment of unresectable recurrent locally advanced or metastatic ESCC in people who had received prior systemic therapy. In an agreement finalized earlier this year, BeiGene granted Novartis rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize tislelizumab in North America, Europe, and Japan through a collaboration and license agreement.

Positive results from the POSEIDON Phase III trial showed AstraZeneca’s <i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) and tremelimumab, when added to platinum-based chemotherapy, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone in the 1st-line treatment of patients with Stage IV (metastatic) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

These results were presented today during a Presidential Symposium at the 2021 World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (abstract PL02.01).

Melissa Johnson, MD, Director of the Lung Cancer Research program at Sarah Cannon Research Institute, and medical oncologist with Tennessee Oncology, PLLC in Nashville, Tennessee, said: “New combinations are increasingly important in addressing the remaining unmet needs that impact patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer – especially combinations that have the potential to improve efficacy in patients with lower PD-L1 expression and deliver the long-term survival benefits that have been observed with CTLA-4 inhibition. The results of POSEIDON confirm that tremelimumab added to <i>Imfinzi </i>and chemotherapy is an effective, well-tolerated treatment in this setting.”

Susan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “The POSEIDON data offer patients further benefit from <i>Imfinzi</i> and are an important validation of our development strategy to explore novel combinations. Adding a short course of tremelimumab to <i>Imfinzi </i>for those patients already receiving chemotherapy, reduced the risk of cancer progressing or death by 28% compared to chemotherapy alone. The results also showed the significant survival improvement did not compromise tolerability in the 1st-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We look forward to discussing these data with regulatory authorities.”

Patients treated with a short course of five cycles of tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 antibody, over 16 weeks in addition to <i>Imfinzi</i> and chemotherapy experienced a 23% reduction in the risk of death versus a range of chemotherapy options (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.77; 95% CI 0.65-0.92; p=0.00304). Median OS was 14.0 months versus 11.7 months for chemotherapy. An estimated 33% of patients were alive at two years versus 22% for chemotherapy. This treatment combination<i> </i>also reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 28% compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.60-0.86; p=0.00031) with a median PFS of 6.2 months versus 4.8 months, respectively. The combination delivered a broadly similar safety profile to the <i>Imfinzi</i> and chemotherapy combination and did not lead to an increased discontinuation of treatment.

POSEIDON also tested the combination of <i>Imfinzi</i> plus chemotherapy, which demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS (HR=0.74; 95% CI 0.62-0.89; p=0.00093) versus chemotherapy alone. A positive OS trend observed for <i>Imfinzi </i>plus chemotherapy did not achieve statistical significance.

The safety profile of each<i> Imfinzi</i> combination was consistent with the known profiles of the individual medicines, and no new safety signals were identified. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were experienced by 51.8% of patients treated with <i>Imfinzi</i>, tremelimumab and chemotherapy and by 44.6% of patients treated with <i>Imfinzi</i> plus chemotherapy, versus 44.4% for chemotherapy. Treatment-related adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 15.5% of patients treated with <i>Imfinzi</i>, tremelimumab and chemotherapy and 14.1% of patients treated with <i>Imfinzi</i> plus chemotherapy, versus 9.9% for chemotherapy.

<i>Imfinzi</i> is the only approved immunotherapy in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy and is the global standard of care based on the PACIFIC Phase III trial. <i>Imfinzi</i> is also approved in the US, the EU, Japan and many countries around the world for the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) based on the CASPIAN Phase III trial.

<i>Imfinzi</i> is being further assessed across all stages of lung cancer as part of an extensive development programme across NSCLC and SCLC, as well as in other tumour types. The combination of <i>Imfinzi</i> and tremelimumab is being tested in lung cancer, bladder cancer and liver cancer settings.

<b>Stage IV NSCLC
</b>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.<sup>1 </sup>Patients are commonly diagnosed at Stage IV, when the tumour has spread outside of the lung.<sup>2</sup>

Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and SCLC, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.<sup>2,3 </sup>Within NSCLC, patients are classified as squamous, representing 25-30% of patients, or non-squamous, the most common type representing approximately 70-75% of NSCLC patients.<sup>2</sup> Stage IV is the most advanced form of lung cancer and is often referred to as metastatic disease.<sup>4</sup>

<b>POSEIDON
</b>The POSEIDON trial was a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, global, Phase III trial of <i>Imfinzi</i> plus platinum-based chemotherapy or <i>Imfinzi, </i>tremelimumab and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in the 1st-line treatment of 1,013 patients with metastatic NSCLC. The trial population included patients with either non-squamous or squamous disease and the full range of PD-L1 expression levels. POSEIDON excluded patients with certain epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusions.

In the experimental arms, patients were treated with a flat dose of 1,500mg of <i>Imfinzi</i> with up to four cycles of chemotherapy once every three weeks or <i>Imfinzi </i>and 75mg of tremelimumab with chemotherapy, followed by maintenance treatment with <i>Imfinzi, </i>or <i>Imfinzi</i> and one dose of tremelimumab on a once-every-four-weeks dosing schedule. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy. Pemetrexed maintenance treatment was allowed in all arms in patients with non-squamous disease if given during the induction phase. Nearly all patients with non-squamous disease (95.5%) had pemetrexed and platinum, while the majority of patients with squamous disease receiving chemotherapy (88.3%) received gemcitabine and platinum.

Primary endpoints included PFS and OS for the <i>Imfinzi</i> plus chemotherapy arm. Key secondary endpoints included PFS and OS in the <i>Imfinzi </i>plus tremelimumab and chemotherapy arm. As both PFS endpoints were met for <i>Imfinzi</i> plus chemotherapy and <i>Imfinzi, </i>tremelimumab and chemotherapy, the prespecified statistical analysis plan allowed for testing OS in the <i>Imfinzi</i> plus tremelimumab and chemotherapy arm. The trial was conducted in more than 150 centres across 18 countries, including the US, Europe, South America, Asia and South Africa.

<b><i>Imfinzi
</i></b>Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

In addition to approvals in ES-SCLC and unresectable, Stage III NSCLC, Imfinzi is approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in several countries. Since the first approval in May 2017, more than 100,000 patients have been treated with Imfinzi.

As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi</i> is being tested as a single treatment and in combinations with other anti-cancer treatments for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, biliary tract cancer (a form of liver cancer), oesophageal cancer, gastric and gastroesophageal cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and other solid tumours.

<b>Tremelimumab
</b>Tremelimumab is a human monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine that targets the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T-cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death. Tremelimumab is being tested in a clinical trial programme in combination with <i>Imfinzi</i> in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer and liver cancer.

AstraZeneca is a founding member of the Lung Ambition Alliance, a global coalition working to accelerate innovation and deliver meaningful improvements for people with lung cancer, including and beyond treatment.

<b>AstraZeneca in immunotherapy
</b>Immunotherapy is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored in immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes <i>Imfinzi</i> as a single treatment and in combination with <i>tremelimumab</i> and other novel antibodies in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of treatment, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small, targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

<b>AstraZeneca in oncology
</b>AstraZeneca is leading a revolution in oncology with the ambition to provide cures for cancer in every form, following the science to understand cancer and all its complexities to discover, develop and deliver life-changing medicines to patients.

The Company’s focus is on some of the most challenging cancers. It is through persistent innovation that AstraZeneca has built one of the most diverse portfolios and pipelines in the industry, with the potential to catalyse changes in the practice of medicine and transform the patient experience.

AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer care and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

CHELMSFORD, Mass. &amp; CAESAREA, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ZOLL<sup>®</sup> Medical Corporation, an Asahi Kasei company that manufactures medical devices and related software solutions, and Itamar™ Medical Ltd. (Nasdaq and TASE: ITMR), a medical device and digital health company focused on the integration of sleep apnea diagnosis into the cardiac patient care pathway, today announced that the two companies signed a definitive agreement under which ZOLL Medical will acquire all outstanding ordinary shares of Itamar Medical for a total value of approximately $538 million.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Itamar Medical is focused on the development and commercialization of non-invasive medical devices and solutions to aid in the diagnosis of respiratory sleep disorders. The company pioneered the WatchPAT<sup>®</sup> Home Sleep Apnea Device, an innovative sleep apnea diagnosis program for patients and healthcare professionals. The WatchPAT device is FDA-cleared and continues to gain recognition as a safe and effective method for home-based testing for sleep apnea.

Research has shown complex interrelationships between cardiovascular disease and both obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA). OSA is associated with increases in the incidence and progression of coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and atrial fibrillation, while CSA associated with Cheyne-Stokes respiration predicts incident heart failure and atrial fibrillation, and strongly predicts mortality among patients with heart failure.<sup>1</sup>

“ZOLL Medical is committed to improving outcomes for underserved patients suffering from serious cardiopulmonary conditions,” said Jon Rennert, CEO of ZOLL Medical. “It is currently estimated that 60% of cardiovascular patients suffer from some form of sleep apnea, and the majority of these patients go undiagnosed.<sup>2</sup> The combination of ZOLL Medical and Itamar Medical will help more patients receive diagnosis and treatment for sleep-disordered breathing. We look forward to helping strengthen the collaboration between the worlds of cardiology and sleep medicine.”

“We are excited to join forces with ZOLL Medical, a leader in addressing the needs of cardiologists and their patients. The integration of Itamar’s WatchPAT<sup>® </sup>technology and Digital Health solution for sleep apnea with ZOLL Medical's commercial footprint will accelerate our mission of advancing home sleep medicine to benefit the population of undiagnosed and untreated patients,” said Gilad Glick, President and Chief Executive Officer of Itamar Medical.

“We believe the transaction is in the best interest of Itamar’s various stakeholders,” said Shy Basson, Itamar’s Chief Financial Officer.

ZOLL Medical has a long history of improving patients’ lives with innovative technologies, including multiple monitoring solutions that aid in the diagnosis and management of cardiac patients. In April 2021, <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zoll.com%2Fnews-releases%2F2021%2F04%2F05%2Fzoll-medical-corporation-acquires-respicardia-inc&amp;esheet=52490275&amp;newsitemid=20210912005033&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=ZOLL+Medical+acquired+Respicardia&amp;index=1&amp;md5=f6011ec09f41c916f2dff49ff81f604e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">ZOLL Medical acquired Respicardia</a>, maker of the <b>rem</b>ede<sup>®</sup> System – the only implantable device approved by the FDA to treat moderate to severe CSA in adult patients.<sup>3</sup>

<b>Transaction Details</b>

Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of ZOLL Medical and Itamar, ZOLL Medical will acquire all outstanding ordinary shares of Itamar Medical for $31 per American Depository Share (ADS), or $1.03 (equivalent to approximately NIS 3.31) per ordinary share, in cash. The offer of $31 per ADS in cash represents a premium of 50.2% over the price of Itamar Medical’s ADS on the Nasdaq Stock Market on September 10, 2021.

ZOLL Medical’s acquisition of Itamar Medical is subject to approval by the shareholders of Itamar Medical, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Assuming typical regulatory and shareholder approval timeframes, the parties currently expect the transaction to close by the end of 2021.

Once the acquisition is completed, it is expected that Itamar Medical’s principal operations will continue at its current location in Caesarea, Israel, including its R&amp;D and Digital Health Technology centers, as well as the production center.

<strong>Hong Kong, Shanghai &amp; Florham Park, NJ </strong><strong>— Monday, September 13, 2021:</strong> HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“HUTCHMED”) (Nasdaq/AIM: HCM; HKEX: 13) today announces that the Center for Drug Evaluation of China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) to amdizalisib (HMPL-689), a highly selective and potent PI3Kd inhibitor, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (“FL”), a subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (“NHL”).

&nbsp;

NMPA grants BTD to new drugs that treat life-threatening diseases or serious conditions for which there are no effective treatment options, and where clinical evidence demonstrates significant advantages over existing therapies. Drug candidates with BTD may be considered for conditional approval and priority review when submitting a New Drug Application (NDA). This indicates that the development and review of amdizalisib for relapsed or refractory FL may be expedited, to address patients’ unmet needs more quickly.

&nbsp;

Christian Hogg, CEO of HUTCHMED, said, “The granting of BTD to amdizalisib by the NMPA underscores the promising clinical value of this highly selective and potent PI3Kd inhibitor. There is a clear need for new therapies in this treatment setting, particularly with regard to specific toxicities and suboptimal efficacy with existing treatments across different lymphoma subtypes. We look forward to important clinical data on amdizalisib being presented at the ESMO Congress next week and are continuing to accelerate global development of this novel therapy.”

&nbsp;

Updated preliminary results from the ongoing Phase Ib expansion study in China will be presented as a <a href=""https://www.hutch-med.com/esmo-2021-highlights/"">Proffered Paper</a> at the 2021 ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology) Congress on September 20, 2021. To date, amdizalisib has been shown to be well tolerated, exhibiting dose-proportional pharmacokinetics (“PK”), a manageable toxicity profile, and single-agent clinical activity in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma patients. Additional details may be found at clinicaltrials.gov, using identifier <a href=""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03128164"">NCT03128164</a>.

&nbsp;

HUTCHMED has initiated an extensive, globally-focused clinical development pathway for amdizalisib. In April 2021, HUTCHMED <a href=""https://www.hutch-med.com/hutchmed-initiates-phase-ii-registration-study-of-hmpl-689-in-patients-with-fl-and-mzl-in-china/"">initiated</a> a Phase II registration study in China for amdizalisib in approximately 100 patients with relapsed or refractory FL and approximately 80 patients with marginal zone lymphoma (“MZL”). The trial is being conducted in over 35 sites in China. Additional details may be found at clinicaltrials.gov, using identifier <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04849351"">NCT04849351</a>.

&nbsp;

Amdizalisib is also being evaluated in an ongoing Phase I/Ib study in the U.S. and Europe in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03786926"">NCT03786926</a>).

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>About PI3Kd and NHL</strong></h4>
PI3Kd (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) is a lipid kinase that controls the activation of several important signaling proteins. Upon an antigen binding to B-cell receptors, PI3Kd can be activated through the Lyn and Syk signaling cascade. The abnormal activation of B-cell receptor signaling is closely related to the development of B-cell type hematological cancers, which represent approximately 85% of all NHL cases. Therefore, PI3Kd is considered a promising target for drugs that aim to treat certain hematologic cancers.

FL accounts for approximately 17% of NHL. In 2020, there were an estimated 16,000 and 13,000 new cases of FL in China and the U.S., respectively<a href=""https://www.hutch-med.com/amdizalisib-breakthrough-therapy-designation-in-china/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"">[i]</a><sup>,<a href=""https://www.hutch-med.com/amdizalisib-breakthrough-therapy-designation-in-china/#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2"">[ii]</a>,<a href=""https://www.hutch-med.com/amdizalisib-breakthrough-therapy-designation-in-china/#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3"">[iii]</a></sup>. Patients with relapsed or refractory FL do not have curative treatment options and have a high unmet need for optimal therapeutic options.

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>About Amdizalisib</strong></h4>
Amdizalisib (HMPL-689) is a novel, selective and potent oral inhibitor targeting the isoform PI3Kd. Amdizalisib’s PK properties are favorable with good oral absorption, moderate tissue distribution and low clearance in preclinical PK studies, suggesting a low risk of drug accumulation and drug-to-drug interaction. Because of its high target selectivity and optimal PK profile, amdizalisib has the potential to demonstrate an optimal benefit-risk profile in this class.

HUTCHMED currently retains all rights to amdizalisib worldwide.

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>About HUTCHMED</strong></h4>

<b class=""first-child"">About RGX-314<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>RGX-314 is being investigated as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other chronic retinal conditions. RGX-314 consists of the NAV AAV8 vector, which encodes an antibody fragment designed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). RGX-314 is believed to inhibit the VEGF pathway by which new, leaky blood vessels grow and contribute to the accumulation of fluid in the retina<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>.

REGENXBIO is advancing research in two separate routes of administration of RGX-314 to the eye, through a standardized subretinal delivery procedure as well as delivery to the suprachoroidal space. REGENXBIO has licensed certain exclusive rights to the SCS Microinjector® from Clearside Biomedical, Inc. to deliver gene therapy treatments to the suprachoroidal space of the eye.

<b class=""first-child"">About Wet AMD<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina<sup>2</sup>. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone<sup>3</sup>. Current anti-VEGF therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients<sup>4</sup>. These therapies, however, require life-long repeated intraocular injections, to maintain efficacy<sup>5,6</sup>.  Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time<sup class=""last-child"">7</sup>.

<b class=""first-child"">About Diabetic Retinopathy<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of vision loss in adults between 24 and 75 years of age worldwide<sup>8</sup>. DR affects approximately eight million people in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> alone<sup>9</sup>. The spectrum of DR severity ranges from non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and as DR progresses, a large proportion of patients develop vision threatening complications, including diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascularization that can lead to blindness<sup>10</sup>.  Current treatment options for patients with DR include ""watchful waiting"", anti-VEGF treatment, retinal laser or surgical treatment<sup class=""last-child"">8</sup>.

<b class=""first-child"">About AbbVie<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>AbbVie's mission is to discover and deliver innovative medicines that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow.

<span class=""bw-dateline-wrapper"">PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span>Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced three-year data from the CheckMate -743 trial that demonstrated a durable survival benefit with first-line treatment with <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) plus <i>Yervoy</i> (ipilimumab) compared to platinum-based standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), regardless of histology.

With a minimum follow-up of three years (35.5 months):
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Among patients treated with <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i>, 23% were alive at three years, compared to 15% of patients treated with chemotherapy.</li>
 	<li>Treatment with the dual immunotherapy combination continued to show a reduction in the risk of death (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.73; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.61 to 0.87), and improvement in median overall survival (OS), the trial’s primary endpoint, vs. chemotherapy (18.1 months vs. 14.1 months, respectively).</li>
</ul>
The safety profile for <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> remained consistent with previously reported data in first-line MPM, with no new safety signals identified. These data will be presented on September 17, 2021 at 13:40 CEST/7:40 a.m. EDT (Abstract #LBA65) during the Proffered Paper session at the 2021 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress.

“For patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, the prognosis is generally poor, with a five-year survival rate of approximately 10%,” said Solange Peters, M.D., Ph.D., Medical Oncology Service, Chair, Thoracic Oncology, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland. “In this aggressive cancer that historically has had limited treatment options, we’ve now not only seen the potential for patients to live longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, but that this benefit is sustained at three years compared to treatment with chemotherapy. These results give us further proof of the durability of the outcomes achieved with this combination.”

At three years of follow-up and approximately one year of being off treatment per protocol, more patients who responded to <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> remained in response than those treated with chemotherapy, and duration of response (DOR) was longer with the dual immunotherapy combination, regardless of histology:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>28% of patients who responded to <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> remained in response at three years compared to no patients (0%) in the chemotherapy arm.</li>
 	<li>Those treated with the dual immunotherapy combination<i></i>had a median DOR of 11.6 months, compared to 6.7 months with chemotherapy.</li>
 	<li>Objective response rate (ORR) in patients treated with the combination was comparable to chemotherapy (39.6% vs. 44.0%, respectively).</li>
</ul>
“The results from the CheckMate -743 trial have changed the way physicians treat malignant pleural mesothelioma, a disease that had no new systemic treatment options for nearly 15 years before the approval of <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy</i>,” said Abderrahim Oukessou, M.D., vice president, thoracic cancers development lead, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We continue to see more evidence for the sustained survival benefits of dual immunotherapy across several tumors, including durable overall survival at four years in non-small cell lung cancer. Now, the combination has demonstrated long-term improvements in overall survival in mesothelioma, another thoracic cancer, extending the lives of patients with a devastating disease.”

<i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> has received approval for use in first-line unresectable MPM from 14 health authorities around the world, including in the U.S., European Union, Japan and China. Additional regulatory applications are under review globally.

<i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i>-based combinations have shown significant improvements in OS in six Phase 3 clinical trials in five tumors to date: malignant pleural mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, advanced renal cell carcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CheckMate -743</span></b>

CheckMate -743 is an open-label, multi-center, randomized Phase 3 trial evaluating <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> compared to chemotherapy (pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin) in patients with previously untreated unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (n=605). In the trial, 303 patients were randomized to receive <i>Opdivo</i> at 3 mg/kg every two weeks and <i>Yervoy</i> at 1 mg/kg every six weeks; 302 patients were randomized to receive cisplatin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or carboplatin AUC 5 plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in 21-day cycles for six cycles. Treatment in both arms continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or, in the <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> arm, up to 24 months. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival (OS) in all randomized patients. Additional efficacy outcome measures included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) utilizing modified RECIST criteria. Exploratory endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and patient reported outcomes.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</span></b>

Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare but aggressive form of cancer that forms in the lining of the lungs. It is most frequently caused by exposure to asbestos. Diagnosis is often delayed, with the majority of patients presenting with advanced or metastatic disease. Prognosis is generally poor: in previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma, median survival is between 12 and 14 months and the five-year survival rate is approximately 10%.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Bristol Myers Squibb: Creating a Better Future for People with Cancer</span></b>

Bristol Myers Squibb is inspired by a single vision — transforming patients’ lives through science. The goal of the company’s cancer research is to deliver medicines that offer each patient a better, healthier life and to make cure a possibility. Building on a legacy across a broad range of cancers that have changed survival expectations for many, Bristol Myers Squibb researchers are exploring new frontiers in personalized medicine, and through innovative digital platforms, are turning data into insights that sharpen their focus. Deep scientific expertise, cutting-edge capabilities and discovery platforms enable the company to look at cancer from every angle. Cancer can have a relentless grasp on many parts of a patient’s life, and Bristol Myers Squibb is committed to taking actions to address all aspects of care, from diagnosis to survivorship. Because as a leader in cancer care, Bristol Myers Squibb is working to empower all people with cancer to have a better future.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Opdivo</i></span></b>

<i>Opdivo</i> is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, <i>Opdivo</i> has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.

<i>Opdivo</i>’s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the <i>Opdivo</i> clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The <i>Opdivo</i> trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from <i>Opdivo</i> across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.

In July 2014, <i>Opdivo</i> was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. <i>Opdivo</i> is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Yervoy </i>combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Yervoy</i></span></b>

<i>Yervoy</i> is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. <i>Yervoy</i> binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <i>Yervoy</i> 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. <i>Yervoy</i> is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for <i>Yervoy</i> spanning multiple tumor types.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 7% (31/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.0%), and Grade 2 (4.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). In NSCLC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%). Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis.

In Checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO, including Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=12).

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.7%) and Grade 2 (1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 25% (115/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.4%), Grade 3 (14%) and Grade 2 (8%).

<span class=""bwuline"">Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</span>

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received OPDIVO monotherapy or OPDIVO in combination with YERVOY or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: <i>cardiac/vascular:</i> myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; <i>nervous system:</i> meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; <i>ocular:</i> uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur; <i>gastrointestinal:</i> pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; <i>musculoskeletal and connective tissue:</i> myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; <i>endocrine:</i> hypoparathyroidism; <i>other (hematologic/immune):</i> hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.

In addition to the immune-mediated adverse reactions listed above, across clinical trials of YERVOY monotherapy or in combination with OPDIVO, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in &lt;1% of patients unless otherwise specified: <i>nervous system:</i> autoimmune neuropathy (2%), myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, motor dysfunction; <i>cardiovascular:</i> angiopathy, temporal arteritis; <i>ocular</i>: blepharitis, episcleritis, orbital myositis, scleritis; <i>gastrointestinal:</i> pancreatitis (1.3%); <i>other (hematologic/immune):</i> conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, hypersensitivity vasculitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis.

Some ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada–like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients. In MPM patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO or YERVOY. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.

Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone</b>

Nuformix plc (LSE: NFX), a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and
oncology via drug repurposing, is pleased to announce that it has signed an exclusive global licensing agreement
with Oxilio Ltd (“Oxilio”), a privately held pharmaceutical development company, for NXP001 (a proprietary new
form of aprepitant) for oncology indications.
Under the terms of the licensing agreement, Oxilio has obtained an exclusive licence to research, develop and
commercialise NXP001 globally for oncology indications. Nuformix is eligible to receive an undisclosed upfront
payment, development milestone payments and a royalty on net sales, capped at £2 million per annum.
• On 23 September 2020, Nuformix granted an exclusive option to Oxilio to license NXP001 globally for
oncology indications. This triggered an undisclosed upfront payment.
• On 22 March 2021, Oxilio exercised its option to acquire a licence for NXP001. Oxilio and Nuformix then
began working together to finalise an exclusive global licensing agreement for NXP001.
Dr Anne Brindley, CEO of Nuformix, said: “We are delighted to complete the licensing agreement with Oxilio -
achieving this exclusive global licensing deal for NXP001 in oncology is a major step forward as it validates the
Nuformix technology and intellectual property, and also endorses our strategy of repurposing drugs and licensing
at an early stage. Nuformix will now concentrate on developing its two lead assets NXP002 and NXP004.”
Dr Simon Yaxley, Co-Founder and Director of Oxilio said: “We are pleased to expand our clinical development
pipeline with the licensing of NXP001, which is highly complementary to our strategy of identifying, repurposing and
commercialising existing drugs to address unmet needs in cancer therapy. NXP001, a novel form of aprepitant with
improved properties, and its Phase 1 study demonstrates the potential for improved bioavailability without needing
a complex formulation. Our hope is for the consolidated efforts under the agreement to enable Oxilio to accelerate
the development of NXP001 and bring new treatment options to a broad range of cancer patients.”

About Nuformix
Nuformix is a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via
drug repurposing. The Company aimsto use its expertise in discovering, developing and patenting novel drug forms,
with improved physical properties, to develop new products in new indications that are, importantly, differentiated
from the original (by way of dosage, delivery route or presentation), thus creating new and attractive commercial
opportunities. Nuformix has an early-stage pipeline of preclinical and Phase 1-ready assets with potential for
significant value and early licensing opportunities.
For more information, please visit www.nuformix.com
About NXP001
NXP001 is a proprietary new form of the drug aprepitant that is currently marketed as a product in the oncology
supportive care setting (chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting). A disadvantage of aprepitant is that its suboptimal properties necessitate a complex formulation. Nuformix discovered and has attained granted patents on
new forms of aprepitant (NXP001) with improved properties.
About Oxilio
Oxilio is a privately held pharmaceutical development company focused on repurposing known drugs for the
treatment of cancer through a programme of corporate alliances coupled with rapid proof of concept clinical
development.
Oxilio will develop and seek to exploit NXP001 globally for the treatment of cancer. It is focused on alleviating the
current dilemma of a shortage of effective drug candidatesthat have potential as new cancertherapies, by adopting
a drug repurposing strategy (identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope
of the original medical indication). The major advantage of this approach is that the pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics and toxicity profiles of these drugs are already reasonably well established. Thus, drug
repurposing is a less risky development route with substantially lower associated development costs. The
agreement with Nuformix allows Oxilio to focus on developing rapidly a unique formulation and dosage form with
NXP001 and progressing into the clinic.

BOCA RATON, Fla., Sept. 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  <a title=""AzurRx BioPharma, Inc."" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=s077BDZ5gW2LOT2qEhFHjIMg6MBmkMnw6Lorr3oaK1FJ5_j4HkExcPk4VszGU70AntiMkFK3mZYNQ3YbVjiJS6dOYT25Uvmeq2BvCpY43ws="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">AzurRx BioPharma, Inc.</a> (“<u>AzurRx</u>” or the “<u>Company</u>”) (NASDAQ: AZRX), a company specializing in the development of targeted, non-systemic therapies for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, today announced that it has entered a definitive agreement to acquire First Wave Bio, Inc. (“<u>First Wave Bio</u>”) in a stock and cash transaction valued at $229 million, including certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. First Wave Bio is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of novel, gut-targeted, small molecule therapies for auto-immune inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and other serious conditions.
<p align=""justify"">In conjunction with the acquisition, AzurRx announced that it is changing its corporate name to “First Wave BioPharma, Inc.” As part of the plan, First Wave BioPharma will trade its common shares on Nasdaq under the new ticker symbol, “FWBI,” which is anticipated to be effective on or about Thursday, September 23, 2021. In addition, the Company will launch a new website with the following address: <a title=""www.firstwavebio.com"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wL4EfAQKS_Ye3_y1HCE9vrOa-UkVw-_ZFl28HYIhksSH4A1qY8GTNQ555gK92zhXqkvw4f5oJT29lj8ca84LtkhvZjQH_Na3Je4r13x2k34="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.firstwavebio.com</a>. AzurRx’s management team, including James Sapirstein, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, will continue to lead the renamed company.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The acquisition of First Wave Bio, and the creation of First Wave BioPharma, Inc. is a transformative event that significantly expands our GI development pipeline and positions our company for new growth opportunities in the inflammatory bowel disease therapeutic space,” stated Mr. Sapirstein. “Our portfolio now includes new indications for several IBDs that represent multi-billion dollar commercial market opportunities. In the U.S. last year, it is estimated that there were more than 850,000 ulcerative colitis diagnoses and 625,000 Crohn’s disease diagnoses, and these patient populations and markets are expected to grow substantially over the next decade. We believe that our proprietary formulations of niclosamide, with their novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, non-systemic absorption, and safety benefits, will enable us to address significant unmet clinical needs for IBD patients, especially in the mild-to-moderate disease categories. With our expanded pipeline and new IBD indications, we expect strong growth and increased shareholder value.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Per the definitive agreement, AzurRx will wholly own all rights to First Wave Bio’s proprietary formulations of niclosamide, a small molecule drug which features anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties that are designed to address multiple GI conditions. Further, AzurRx will have sole ownership of First Wave Bio’s robust intellectual property (IP) portfolio, which covers method of use and delivery of these formulations as treatments for various auto-immune, inflammatory and viral conditions.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In January 2021, AzurRx in-licensed from First Wave Bio the exclusive global rights to develop two niclosamide therapeutic indications – for COVID-19-related GI infections, and for immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated colitis and diarrhea (ICI-AC) in advanced stage cancer patients. Following the acquisition of First Wave Bio, AzurRx’s internal development pipeline will include three new clinical IBD indications in ulcerative proctitis (UP) and ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (UPS), ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn’s disease (CD).</p>
<p align=""justify"">James Pennington, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of AzurRx, commented, “There is a wealth of clinical data that supports the antiviral and anti-inflammatory capabilities of niclosamide. More recently, data generated by First Wave Bio in ulcerative proctitis supported the broader potential for niclosamide in multiple inflammatory bowel diseases where we believe our niclosamide formulations could offer significant advantages over other currently available treatments including steroids, 5-ASAs, and biologics – especially in the mild-to-moderate disease stage. Specifically, our niclosamide formulations are orally delivered, are targeted specifically to the areas of the GI tract where the disease-causing inflammation occurs, and avoid the risk of steroid-related immunosuppressant complications. Additionally, the manufacturing process for our niclosamide products can be scaled up to supply large populations quickly.”</p>
Mr. Sapirstein commented, “I’m excited about our expanded pipeline as we move into the IBD therapeutic space. We will now be advancing a pipeline that spans six indications and includes several clinical-stage programs. These programs are all built around our two proprietary technologies -- niclosamide, and adrulipase (MS1819), which we are continuing to develop as a treatment for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a life-threatening digestive disorder seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis. With multiple clinical trials advancing and others to soon initiate, along with a strong portfolio of long-lasting patents protecting niclosamide’s use for COVID-19 GI infections, ICI-AC and the IBDs, the next several years should be rich in milestones as we continue to advance our development programs, generate data, and bring new assets into the clinic.”
<p align=""justify"">Gary D. Glick, CEO and Founder of First Wave Bio, added, “This is an exciting day. We believe the acquisition of First Wave Bio by AzurRx will unlock the value of our proprietary niclosamide formulations targeting IBD. We are confident that the AzurRx team will successfully advance these programs along their respective clinical and regulatory pathways.”</p>
Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, the transaction is being effected via a reverse triangular merger, and is anticipated to close imminently this morning upon receipt of evidence from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the completion of certain filings relating to the merger. For a more detailed description of the terms of the First Wave Bio acquisition and the related definitive merger agreement, please see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 13, 2021.

<p align=""justify""><strong>About Niclosamide</strong>
Niclosamide is a prescription small molecule drug listed as an essential medicine by the World Health Organization (WHO). Niclosamide has been safely used by millions of patients for several clinical indications. In the U.S., niclosamide was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982 for the treatment of intestinal tapeworm infections. In addition to its antihelminthic activity, niclosamide has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About First Wave Bio, Inc.</strong>
First Wave Bio was founded to improve the lives of people living with IBD. Recent discoveries in immune cell metabolism have opened up the possibility of selectively targeting disease-causing immune cells to treat inflammatory diseases without unwanted side effects such as broad immunosuppression. First Wave Bio has developed a suite of MetaWave product candidates, gut-restricted small molecules that target the metabolism of disease-causing Th17 cells. The company’s first clinical MetaWave program, FW-424, has shown benefits for patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis in a Phase 1b/2a trial. First Wave is advancing FW-424 through additional clinical studies in patients with mild-to-moderate IBD. Given FW-424’s novel mechanisms of action and established safety profile, First Wave Bio believes that it has the potential to replace the current standard-of-care and improve the lives of patients at all stages of IBD.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","REDWOOD CITY, Calif. and SHANGHAI, China , Sept. 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Coherus Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: CHRS) and Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. (“Junshi Biosciences”, HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180) announced the presentation today of positive interim results from the pivotal study “CHOICE-01” (NCT03856411), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating toripalimab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of advanced squamous or non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without driver mutations. The interim analysis met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 compared to chemotherapy alone.

The interim results were summarized on September 13 in a presentation by Professor Jie Wang, MD, PhD, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, during the Mini Oral Session at the 2021 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). The abstract detailing the interim results was first made available on the WCLC website on August 18.

“The addition of toripalimab to standard 1st-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer showed superior progression free survival, overall response rate and duration of response over chemotherapy alone, with a safety profile consistent with the PD-1 inhibitor class of drugs,” said Dr. Wang. “Overall survival data are still maturing, with a notable emerging trend favoring the toripalimab-chemotherapy combination. We look forward to additional data from this study and believe CHOICE-01 results will provide strong evidence to support the use of toripalimab with chemotherapy as a 1st-line therapeutic option for NSCLC.”

A final analysis of progression free survival and an additional interim overall survival analysis are expected later this year. Junshi Biosciences and Coherus plan to meet with the United States Food and Drug Administration to discuss a potential submission to the pending biologics license application of an efficacy supplement for toripalimab for the first line treatment, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, of advanced, unresectable NSCLC without driver mutations.

“CHOICE-01 is the first of four pivotal clinical trials evaluating toripalimab for the treatment of lung cancer to have clinical data presented, and its positive results are a promising start for toripalimab in lung cancer. Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer worldwide and the leading cause of death due to cancer, so there is a clear need to develop complementary approaches to standard chemotherapy to improve patient outcomes, maintain quality of life, and seek to improve survival for patients diagnosed with this deadly disease. We will work closely with Coherus and the regulatory authorities to bring this new therapy to patients in the United States,” said Dr. Patricia Keegan, Chief Medical Officer of Junshi Biosciences.

“The CHOICE-01 interim data presented at WCLC are encouraging early evidence for toripalimab’s clinical benefit in the first-line setting in non-small cell lung cancer,” said Denny Lanfear, CEO of Coherus. “We eagerly anticipate additional results from this study and the potential to advance toripalimab toward registration for this indication in the United States.”

Toripalimab Phase 3 clinical trials in lung cancer
Junshi Biosciences and Coherus are currently evaluating toripalimab in four pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in lung cancer.

CHOICE-01, with 465 patients enrolled, is comparing toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. The study met the primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) at the interim analysis (data cut-off date: November 17, 2020). Patients receiving the placebo-chemotherapy combination were allowed to actively cross over to toripalimab treatment at the time of disease progression. Overall survival (OS) data are still maturing and exhibiting a trend favoring the toripalimab-chemotherapy arm as of a March 2021 observation. Final PFS and additional interim OS analyses are expected later in 2021.
Toripalimab is also being evaluated in combination with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations whose tumors are no longer responding to EGFR TKI therapy. Enrollment of 350 subjects in this Phase 3 study is on track to be completed by the end of 2021. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS. Initial results are expected in 2022.
In the neoadjuvant setting, toripalimab is being evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in a Phase 3 study with 406 patients with NSCLC scheduled to undergo surgical resection of their lung cancer. Enrollment is on track to be completed by the end of 2021. The primary endpoints of the study are major pathological response and event free survival. Initial results are expected in 2022.
Toripalimab is being evaluated in combination with standard chemotherapy in a Phase 3 study with 442 patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Enrollment is complete. PFS and OS are the co-primary endpoints. Results are expected by the first half of 2022.
About Toripalimab
Toripalimab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody developed for its ability to block PD-1 interactions with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, and for enhanced receptor internalization (endocytosis function). Blocking PD-1 interactions with PD-L1 and PD-L2 is thought to recharge the immune system’s ability to attack and kill tumor cells. More than thirty company-sponsored toripalimab clinical studies covering more than fifteen indications have been conducted globally, including in China and the United States. Ongoing or completed pivotal clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of toripalimab for a broad range of tumor types including cancers of the lung, nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, breast, liver, kidney and skin.

In China, toripalimab was the first domestic anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for marketing (approved in China as TUOYI®). On December 17, 2018, toripalimab was granted a conditional approval by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the second-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In December 2020, toripalimab was successfully included in the updated National Reimbursement Drug List. In February 2021, the NMPA granted a conditional approval to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after failure of at least two lines of prior systemic therapy. In April 2021, NMPA granted a conditional approval to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who failed platinum-containing chemotherapy or progressed within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy. In addition, two supplemental NDAs for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic NPC or for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced, or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were accepted by the NMPA for review in February and July 2021 respectively.

In the United States, the first toripalimab BLA has been submitted to the FDA for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designations for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the 1st line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC and for toripalimab monotherapy in the 2nd line and subsequent treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. There are currently no PD-1 blocking antibodies approved for use in NPC in the United States. Additionally, FDA has granted Fast Track designation for toripalimab for the treatment of mucosal melanoma and orphan drug designation for NPC, mucosal melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma. Earlier in 2021 Coherus in-licensed rights to develop and commercialize toripalimab in the United States and Canada. Coherus and Junshi Biosciences plan to file additional toripalimab BLAs with the FDA over the next three years for multiple rare cancers and highly prevalent cancers.

The study met the primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) at the interim analysis (data cut-off date: November 17, 2020). Patients receiving the placebo-chemotherapy combination were allowed to actively cross over to toripalimab treatment at the time of disease progression. Overall survival (OS) data are still maturing and exhibiting a trend favoring the toripalimab-chemotherapy arm as of a March 2021 observation. Final PFS and additional interim OS analyses are expected later in 2021.
Toripalimab is also being evaluated in combination with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations whose tumors are no longer responding to EGFR TKI therapy. Enrollment of 350 subjects in this Phase 3 study is on track to be completed by the end of 2021. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS. Initial results are expected in 2022.
In the neoadjuvant setting, toripalimab is being evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in a Phase 3 study with 406 patients with NSCLC scheduled to undergo surgical resection of their lung cancer. Enrollment is on track to be completed by the end of 2021. The primary endpoints of the study are major pathological response and event free survival. Initial results are expected in 2022.
Toripalimab is being evaluated in combination with standard chemotherapy in a Phase 3 study with 442 patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Enrollment is complete. PFS and OS are the co-primary endpoints. Results are expected by the first half of 2022.
About Toripalimab
Toripalimab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody developed for its ability to block PD-1 interactions with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, and for enhanced receptor internalization (endocytosis function). Blocking PD-1 interactions with PD-L1 and PD-L2 is thought to recharge the immune system’s ability to attack and kill tumor cells. More than thirty company-sponsored toripalimab clinical studies covering more than fifteen indications have been conducted globally, including in China and the United States. Ongoing or completed pivotal clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of toripalimab for a broad range of tumor types including cancers of the lung, nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, breast, liver, kidney and skin.

In China, toripalimab was the first domestic anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for marketing (approved in China as TUOYI®). On December 17, 2018, toripalimab was granted a conditional approval by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the second-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In December 2020, toripalimab was successfully included in the updated National Reimbursement Drug List. In February 2021, the NMPA granted a conditional approval to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after failure of at least two lines of prior systemic therapy. In April 2021, NMPA granted a conditional approval to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who failed platinum-containing chemotherapy or progressed within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy. In addition, two supplemental NDAs for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic NPC or for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced, or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were accepted by the NMPA for review in February and July 2021 respectively.

In the United States, the first toripalimab BLA has been submitted to the FDA for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designations for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the 1st line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC and for toripalimab monotherapy in the 2nd line and subsequent treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. There are currently no PD-1 blocking antibodies approved for use in NPC in the United States. Additionally, FDA has granted Fast Track designation for toripalimab for the treatment of mucosal melanoma and orphan drug designation for NPC, mucosal melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma. Earlier in 2021 Coherus in-licensed rights to develop and commercialize toripalimab in the United States and Canada. Coherus and Junshi Biosciences plan to file additional toripalimab BLAs with the FDA over the next three years for multiple rare cancers and highly prevalent cancers.

<section class=""sec__margin--middle-b"">
<p class=""mod__txt--normal"">Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan; President, Representative Director, Gyo Sagara; “ONO”) and Bristol-Myers Squibb K.K. (Shinjuku, Tokyo; President, Jean-Christophe Barland; “BMSKK”) today announced that the companies have submitted supplemental application in Japan for the combination therapy of Opdivo® (generic name: nivolumab) Intravenous Infusion (“Opdivo”), a human anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and Yervoy® (generic name: ipilimumab) Injection (“Yervoy”), a human anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody, for the first-line treatment of unresectable, advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer, for a partial change in approved items of the manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan.
Furthermore, ONO also submitted a supplemental application for the combination therapy of Opdivo and chemotherapy for the above same indication.</p>
<p class=""mod__txt--normal""> The applications are based on results from the global multi-center, randomized, open-label Phase 3 CheckMate -648 study (ONO-4538-50/CA209648), evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy and Opdivo plus chemotherapy*, compared to chemotherapy* alone in patients with previously untreated unresectable advanced or recurrent metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this study, both Opdivo-based treatment combinations (Opdivo plus Yervoy and Opdivo plus chemotherapy) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS), compared to chemotherapy at the pre-specified interim analysis in patients with tumor cell PD-L1 expression =1%, as well as in the all-randomized population. The safety profiles of Opdivo plus Yervoy and Opdivo plus chemotherapy were consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual components.</p>

<h4 class=""mod__ttl-4 fz19"">About CheckMate -648 (ONO-4538-50/CA209648) study</h4>
<p class=""mod__txt--normal""> CheckMate -648 is a global multi-center, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study, evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy and Opdivo plus chemotherapy (fluorouracil and cisplatin combination therapy) versus chemotherapy (fluorouracil and cisplatin combination therapy) alone in patients with previously untreated unresectable advanced or recurrent metastatic ESCC. The primary endpoints of the study are OS and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the blinded independent central review (BICR) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 =1% for both Opdivo-based combination therapies versus chemotherapy. The major secondary endpoints of the study are OS and PFS as assessed by the BICR in the all-randomized population.
In the Opdivo plus Yervoy arm, patients received treatment with Opdivo at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and Yervoy at 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks up to 24 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the Opdivo plus chemotherapy arm, patients received treatment with Opdivo at 240 mg every 2 weeks, fluorouracil 800 mg/m²/day on Day 1 through Day 5 (for 5 days), and cisplatin 80 mg/m² on Day 1 of four-week cycle. Patients received Opdivo for up to 24 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, and chemotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</p>

<h4 class=""mod__ttl-4 fz19"">About esophageal cancer</h4>
<p class=""mod__txt--normal""> Esophageal cancer is a malignant tumor that occurs in the inner layer (mucosa) of the esophagus and grows outside (toward the deeper layer). There are two main histological types of esophageal cancer; squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma. SCC is the predominant type accounting for about 90% of all esophageal cancer in Japan. It is estimated that there are about 26,000 new cases per year<sup> 1)</sup> diagnosed with esophageal cancer in Japan (about 604,000 cases worldwide<sup> 2)</sup>) and approximately 12,000 deaths per year<sup> 1)</sup> (about 544,000 worldwide<sup> 2)</sup>) resulting from this disease. In Japan, the combination therapy of fluorouracil and cisplatin (FP therapy) is widely used as one of the first-line treatment options for unresectable advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer<sup> 3)</sup>, but additional treatment options are needed because of the insufficient effectiveness of the currently available therapies in the extension of OS.</p>

<h4 class=""mod__ttl-4 fz19"">About Opdivo</h4>
<p class=""mod__txt--normal""> Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers since the approval for the treatment of melanoma in Japan in July 2014. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, the US and European Union.
In Japan, ONO launched Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable melanoma in September 2014. Thereafter, Opdivo received an approval for additional indications of unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer in December 2015, unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma in August 2016, relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma in December 2016, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer in March 2017, unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer which has progressed after chemotherapy in September 2017, unresectable advanced or recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma which has progressed after chemotherapy in August 2018, and microsatellite instability high (MSI-High) unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer that has progressed following chemotherapy and unresectable advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer that has progressed following chemotherapy in February 2020.
In addition, ONO has submitted supplemental applications for the adjuvant treatment of urothelial cancer and cancer of unknown primary, and is conducting clinical development program including hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer, etc.</p>

</section><section class=""sec__margin--middle-b"">
<h4 class=""mod__ttl-4 fz19"">About Yervoy</h4>
<p class=""mod__txt--normal""> Yervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody, and binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4, and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Yervoy 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Yervoy is now approved in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for Yervoy spanning multiple tumor types. In Japan, Yervoy was approved for the indication of unresectable malignant melanoma in July 2015.</p>

<h4 class=""mod__ttl-4 fz19"">About the ONO and Bristol Myers Squibb Collaboration</h4>
<p class=""mod__txt--normal""> In 2011, through a collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), ONO granted BMS its territorial rights to develop and commercialize Opdivo globally except in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where ONO had retained all rights to Opdivo except the US at the time. In July 2014, ONO and BMS further expanded the companies’ strategic collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize multiple immunotherapies – as single agent and combination regimens – for patients with cancer in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.</p>

<span class=""xn-location"">MISSISSAUGA, ON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 14, 2021</span> /CNW/ - Amgen today announced that Health Canada has approved LUMAKRAS<sup>TM</sup> (sotorasib) for the treatment of adult patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutated locally advanced (not amenable to curative therapy) or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. LUMAKRAS was granted a Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

""<i>KRAS</i> is a puzzle cancer researchers have been trying to solve for four decades,"" said Suna Avcil, executive medical director, Amgen Canada. ""The first and only targeted therapy for patients with NSCLC who carry the <i>KRAS</i> G12C mutation, LUMAKRAS is a new option for these patients whose cancer has progressed beyond first-line therapy.""

Health <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> based its approval of LUMAKRAS on results from a subset of patients in the phase 2 CodeBreaK 100 trial, the largest clinical trial conducted to date exclusively for patients with the KRAS G12C mutation.

The trial investigated efficacy and tolerability in 126 patients with <i>KRAS</i> G12C mutation-positive advanced NSCLC who had disease progression after receiving an immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy. The most common adverse reactions (= 20%) were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity and cough. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of LUMAKRAS occurred in 9% of patients.

""Facing a difficult condition and an often-poor prognosis, patients with <i>KRAS</i> G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer have been in dire need of additional treatment options,"" says Dr. Mark Vincent, MB, ChB, MRCP(UK), FRCPC, medical oncologist, London Health Sciences Centre, London Regional Cancer Program. ""Innovative treatments like LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) offer physicians and patients a new and important therapeutic option for these patients.""

""Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and it accounts for more deaths worldwide than colon cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer combined,"" says <span class=""xn-person"">Shem Singh</span>, Executive Director, Lung Cancer Canada. ""We are pleased to see continued innovation, like this one in the area of KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, that offers patients a treatment new choice as they and their physicians work together to manage their condition.""

NSCLC accounts for approximately 84% of the 2.2 million new lung cancer diagnoses each year worldwide.2<sup>,3</sup> <i>KRAS </i>G12C is one of the most prevalent driver mutations in NSCLC, with approximately 10% - 15% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC having the <i>KRAS</i> G12C mutation.<sup>1</sup>

<b>About LUMAKRAS<sup>TM</sup> (sotorasib)</b>

LUMAKRAS was the first <i>KRAS </i>G12C inhibitor to enter the clinic and is being studied in the largest clinical trial conducted to date exclusively for patients with the <i>KRAS G12C</i> mutation.

LUMAKRAS has demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile with rapid, deep and durable anticancer activity in patients with locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation with a once daily oral formulation.

As part of the evaluation for the conditional approval of LUMAKRAS in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> as a second line therapy for adult patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received at least one prior systemic therapy, Health Canada requires verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

LUMAKRAS is also being studied in multiple other solid tumours.<sup>4</sup>

Amgen submitted Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) for sotorasib in <span class=""xn-location"">Australia</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Brazil</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> and the <span class=""xn-location"">United Kingdom</span> in <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2021</span> to participate in the FDA's Project Orbis initiative – a pilot program that aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures treatments are made available to patients as early as possible.

<b>About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and the <i>KRAS </i>G12C Mutation</b>

Overall survival rates for non-small cell lung cancer are improving, but remain poor for patients with advanced disease.<sup>5</sup>

<i>KRAS </i>G12C is the most common <i>KRAS</i> mutation in NSCLC.6 Approximately 10% - 15% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC harbor the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation.<sup>1</sup> Unmet medical need remains high and treatment options are limited for NSCLC patients with the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation whose first-line treatment has failed to work or has stopped working. The outcomes with current therapies are suboptimal with a median progression-free survival of approximately 4 months following second-line treatment of <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutated NSCLC.<sup>7 </sup>

<b>About CodeBreaK</b>

The CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen's drug sotorasib is designed to treat patients with an advanced solid tumour with the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers. As the most advanced <i>KRAS </i>G12C clinical development program, CodeBreaK has enrolled more than 800 patients across 13 tumour types since its inception.

CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutant solid tumours. Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumour type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The Phase 2 trial in NSCLC enrolled 126 patients, 124 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline. The Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer (CRC) is fully enrolled and topline results are expected later in 2021.

A global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutated NSCLC (CodeBreaK 200) has completed enrollment. Amgen also has several Phase <span class=""xn-money"">1b</span> studies investigating sotorasib monotherapy and sotorasib combination therapy across various advanced solid tumours (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment.

<b>Forward-Looking Statements</b>

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the integration of Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) into our business (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), or the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in <span class=""xn-location"">Puerto Rico</span>, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

<span class=""xn-location"">TEL AVIV, Israel</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">RALEIGH, NC</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 14, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (Nasdaq: RDHL) (""RedHill"" or the ""Company""), a specialty biopharmaceutical company, today announced preliminary top-line data from the 475-patient global Phase 2/3 study with opaganib (ABC294640)[1] in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Preliminary top-line data showed that the study did not meet its primary endpoint. Analysis of the study efficacy endpoints did show trends in favor of the opaganib arm vs. placebo across multiple endpoints, including the primary endpoint, despite not achieving statistical significance.

Top-line safety data showed good tolerability of opaganib, with balanced adverse events between the study arms. These findings, together with preliminary analysis pointing to increased benefit in a subset of patients requiring less oxygen, could support the potential utilization of opaganib in earlier stages of the disease and are in line with the previously announced results from the U.S. Phase 2 study and the previously observed antiviral activity of opaganib.

""We would like to thank the patients, physicians and supporting medical staff who took part in this important study. While we are disappointed with the data not reaching statistical significance, we do see a trend that needs to be investigated that opaganib may provide benefit to patients earlier in the course of the disease. This correlates with what we know about opaganib's strong antiviral mechanism and effect against variants, as well as its mechanism of action and previously announced results from the Phase 2 U.S. study with opaganib,"" <b>said <span class=""xn-person"">Dror Ben Asher</span>, RedHill CEO</b>. ""In parallel, we continue to make progress with our Phase 2/3 study with another novel, orally-administered drug candidate, RHB-107 (upamostat) in non-hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 patients, with the recent approval of the study in <span class=""xn-location"">South Africa</span> and its expansion within <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>. We are determined to continue our efforts to advance potential treatments to address COVID-19 and its overwhelming impact worldwide.""

The multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 study enrolled 475 subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring hospitalization and treatment with supplemental oxygen. Subjects were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either opaganib or placebo, on top of standard-of-care therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients breathing room air without oxygen support by Day 14.

Analysis of the top-line data is ongoing, including an analysis of the potential for increased benefit of treatment with opaganib in patients at earlier stages of disease. RedHill intends to discuss the data with regulators, including U.S. FDA and foreign regulators, to help determine next steps.

The top-line results from the Company's Phase 2/3 study with opaganib are preliminary in nature, as they are based solely on top-line information provided to the Company by an independent third-party contractor. The Company intends to examine the data from this study in greater detail, along with all of the information gathered during this study, including all safety, and secondary outcome measures. Such analysis may result in findings inconsistent with the top-line data disclosed in this release. As such, investors should not rely on the top-line results reported in this release as the final definitive results of the study.

Opaganib is a novel small molecule investigational drug in oral pill form. Opaganib has a unique dual antiviral and anti-inflammatory mechanism of action that acts on the viral cause and inflammatory effect of COVID-19. It is believed to exert its antiviral effect by selectively inhibiting SK2, a key enzyme produced in human cells that may be recruited by the virus to support its replication.

<b>About Opaganib (ABC294640)</b>

Opaganib, a new chemical entity, is a proprietary, first-in-class, orally-administered, sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2) selective inhibitor, with dual anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity. Opaganib is host-targeted and is expected to be effective against emerging viral variants, having already demonstrated strong inhibition against variants of concern, including <i>Delta</i>. Opaganib has also shown anticancer activity and positive preclinical results in renal fibrosis, and also has the potential to target multiple oncology, viral, inflammatory, and gastrointestinal indications.

Opaganib previously delivered positive U.S. Phase 2 data in patients with severe COVID-19, recently <a href=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.23.21262464v1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">published in medRxiv</a>.

Opaganib has also received Orphan Drug designation from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma and is being evaluated in a Phase 2a study in advanced cholangiocarcinoma and in a Phase 2 study in prostate cancer. Based on a preliminary review of partial unaudited data, the ongoing study in prostate cancer has met its primary endpoint. Patient accrual, treatment and analysis in this study are ongoing.

Opaganib demonstrated potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, inhibiting viral replication of all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested to date in an <i>in vitro</i> model of human lung bronchial tissue. Additionally, preclinical <i>in vivo</i> studies have demonstrated opaganib's potential to ameliorate inflammatory lung disorders, such as pneumonia, have demonstrated opaganib's potential to decrease renal fibrosis and have shown decreased fatality rates from influenza virus infection and amelioration of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>-induced lung injury by reducing the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids<sup>[2]</sup>.

The ongoing clinical studies with opaganib are registered on <u><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</a></u>, a web-based service by the U.S. National Institute of Health, which provides public access to information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia &amp; BOSTON – AbCellera (Nasdaq: ABCL), a technology company with a centralized operating system for next-generation antibody discovery, today announced it has acquired TetraGenetics, Inc. (TetraGenetics), a biotechnology company with a proprietary platform for generating recombinant human ion channels and other transmembrane proteins, in an all-cash transaction that includes an upfront payment, the potential for payments based on the achievement of technical milestones, and additional development and commercial milestone payments related to successfully developed therapeutics.

TetraGenetics has leading technology and expertise in the expression and purification of ion channels, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), and other transmembrane proteins, which are implicated in many human diseases, including pain and autoimmune disorders. High-value transmembrane proteins have proven extremely difficult to produce, making the generation of antibodies against them even more challenging. TetraGenetics has established a protein expression platform that addresses these production challenges and is uniquely able to generate highly pure, complex transmembrane proteins in quantities large enough to support antibody discovery. Integrating TetraGenetics’ capabilities into AbCellera’s technology stack provides an optimized protein source for AbCellera’s antibody discovery. Together, these technologies have the potential to unlock the discovery of antibodies against these validated and sought-after drug targets.

“AbCellera is committed to investing in teams and technologies that have the potential to create new therapeutic opportunities, drive more value in our partnership business, and bring new therapies to patients,” said Carl Hansen, Ph.D., CEO of AbCellera. “We look forward to welcoming the TetraGenetics team and believe that these new capabilities, once integrated into AbCellera’s technology stack, will empower the discovery of new antibody therapies across a range of therapeutic areas.”

“TetraGenetics was founded to target complex membrane proteins, many of which historically have been intractable drug targets,” said Doug Kahn, CEO of TetraGenetics. “This acquisition recognizes our team’s innovation in creating new technologies to address these therapeutically important classes of proteins, and we’re excited to combine each company’s capabilities to discover new antibody treatments.”

<span class=""xn-location"">COPENHAGEN, Denmark</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 14, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- IO Biotech, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, immune-modulating cancer therapies based on its T-win® technology platform, announced today that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck &amp; Co., Inc., <span class=""xn-location"">Kenilworth, NJ</span>, USA (known as MSD outside the US and <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>), through a subsidiary. The purpose of the collaboration is to evaluate IO Biotech's lead candidate, IO102-IO103, in combination with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), MSD's anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy, in patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma.  IO102-IO103 is an investigational cancer vaccine designed to target the immunosuppressive mechanisms mediated by key immunosuppressive proteins such as Indoleamine 2,3-dehydrogenase (IDO) and PD-L1.

""We are pleased to collaborate with MSD to study the potential of our IDO and PD-L1 derived immune-modulating therapy in combination with KEYTRUDA as part of our broad, late-stage development program,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Mai-Britt Zocca</span>, PhD, CEO and founder of IO Biotech. ""Although therapies are available to treat metastatic melanoma, the clinical outcomes for patients with advanced disease remain poor and novel therapeutic options are desperately needed. We look forward to expanding our data set on IO102-IO103 with KEYTRUDA combination results, which we believe will support the potential approval of IO102-IO103 as a first-line therapy for melanoma and other difficult-treat-cancers.""

The planned Phase 3 trial will be an open label, randomized clinical trial that will evaluate the combination of IO102-IO103 with MSD's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA, versus KEYTRUDA alone in patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma.  Biomarker studies will also be conducted. Under the terms of the agreement, IO Biotech will sponsor the Phase 3 trial and MSD will supply KEYTRUDA.

In a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of 30 patients with metastatic melanoma, IO102-IO103, in combination with anti PD1 mAb, demonstrated an ability to induce meaningful tumor regression and establish durable antitumor response while achieving a manageable tolerability profile for patients. In this trial, we observed a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) of 73% and a complete response (CR) rate of 47%. Based on the results from this trial, IO102-IO103, in combination with pembrolizumab, was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of unresectable/metastatic melanoma.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160), a global biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative medicines worldwide, today announced that BRUKINSA<sup>®</sup> (zanubrutinib) has received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one anti-CD20-based regimen.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

This accelerated approval is based on overall response rate (ORR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

“We are excited about the FDA’s approval for BRUKINSA in patients with previously treated marginal zone lymphoma, a significant milestone that was made possible by the diligent BeiGene team, the dedicated investigators, and the participating patients and their families. The MAGNOLIA trial results provided additional evidence that the selective design of BRUKINSA can be translated to improved treatment outcomes for these patients,” said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Hematology at BeiGene. “The ongoing evaluation of BRUKINSA in its broad global clinical program will enable us to further understand this potentially best-in-class BTK inhibitor and its impact on patients. Since the initial FDA approval in November 2019, BRUKINSA has been granted 12 approvals in four indications globally. We will continue to execute on our mission to improve access to innovative and quality treatments for cancer patients worldwide.”

“BTK plays a critical role in B-cell receptor signaling, a driver in the development of marginal zone lymphoma. In the MAGNOLIA trial, BRUKINSA demonstrated impressive overall response and complete remission rates, with responses observed in all MZL subtypes. In addition, this next-generation BTK inhibitor was well-tolerated in these patients, with low rate of discontinuation due to adverse reactions. We are optimistic that BRUKINSA will bring clinically meaningful benefit to patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma,” said Stephen Opat, FRACP, FRCPA, MBBS, Director of Clinical Hematology at Monash Health, Head of Department of Hematology at Monash University, and lead principal investigator of the MAGNOLIA trial.

“The approval of BRUKINSA offers patients with relapsed and refractory marginal zone lymphoma a new treatment option and new hope for improving patient outcomes,” commented Meghan Gutierrez, Chief Executive Officer of the Lymphoma Research Foundation.

The FDA approval of BRUKINSA is based on efficacy results from two single-arm clinical trials, with ORR as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) per 2014 Lugano Classification as the primary endpoint.

In the multicenter, pivotal Phase 2 MAGNOLIA trial (NCT03846427) in patients with R/R MZL who received at least one anti-CD20-based regimen, a total of 66 patients were evaluated, including 26 with extranodal subtype, 26 with nodal subtype, 12 with splenic subtype, and four with unknown subtype. Based on assessment using CT scan, the ORR was 56% (95% CI: 43, 68) with a complete response (CR) rate of 20%; based on assessment prioritizing PET-CT scan, the ORR was 67% (95% CI: 54, 78) with a CR rate of 26%. The median duration of response (DoR) was not reached at the median follow-up time of 8.3 months, with 85% of responders still in remission at 12 months (95% CI: 67, 93). Responses were observed in all MZL subtypes.

In the global Phase 1/2 trial of BGB-3111-AU-003 (NCT02343120), a total of 20 patients were evaluated, including nine with extranodal subtype, five with nodal subtype, and six with splenic subtype. Based on assessment using CT scan, the ORR was 80% (95% CI: 56, 94) with a CR rate of 20%. The median DoR was not reached at the median follow-up time of 31.4 months, with 72% of responders still in remission at 12 months (95% CI: 40, 88).

The most common (=30%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, in the pooled safety population of 847 patients were decreased neutrophil count, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased platelet count, hemorrhage, decreased lymphocyte count, rash, and musculoskeletal pain.

The recommended dose of BRUKINSA is either 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily, taken orally with or without food. The dose may be adjusted for adverse reactions and reduced for patients with severe hepatic impairment and certain drug interactions.

<b>About BRUKINSA</b>

BRUKINSA is a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) discovered by BeiGene scientists that is currently being evaluated globally in a broad clinical program as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various B-cell malignancies. Because new BTK is continuously synthesized, BRUKINSA was specifically designed to deliver complete and sustained inhibition of the BTK protein by optimizing bioavailability, half-life, and selectivity. With differentiated pharmacokinetics compared to other approved BTK inhibitors, BRUKINSA has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of malignant B cells within a number of disease relevant tissues.

BRUKINSA is approved in the following indications and regions:

<b>IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION FOR BRUKINSA (ZANUBRUTINIB)</b>

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Warnings and Precautions</span></b>

<b>Hemorrhage</b>

Fatal and serious hemorrhagic events have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria and hemothorax have been reported in 3.4% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Hemorrhage events of any grade occurred in 35% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy.

Bleeding events have occurred in patients with and without concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Co-administration of BRUKINSA with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications may further increase the risk of hemorrhage.

Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Discontinue BRUKINSA if intracranial hemorrhage of any grade occurs. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding BRUKINSA for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.

<b>Infections</b>

Fatal and serious infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) and opportunistic infections have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 27% of patients, most commonly pneumonia. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation have occurred.

Consider prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and other infections according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever or other signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately.

<b>Cytopenias</b>

Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (26%), thrombocytopenia (11%) and anemia (8%) based on laboratory measurements, developed in patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 13% of patients, and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 3.6% of patients.<i></i>

Monitor complete blood counts regularly during treatment and interrupt treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue treatment as warranted. Treat using growth factor or transfusions, as needed.

<b>Second Primary Malignancies</b>

Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinoma, have occurred in 14% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer, reported in 8% of patients. Other second primary malignancies included malignant solid tumors (4.0%), melanoma (1.7%) and hematologic malignancies (1.2%). Advise patients to use sun protection and monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies.

<b>Cardiac Arrhythmias</b>

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter were reported in 3.2% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, and acute infections may be at increased risk. Grade 3 or higher events were reported in 1.1% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Monitor signs and symptoms for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage as appropriate.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on findings in animals, BRUKINSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity including malformations at exposures that were 5 times higher than those reported in patients at the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking BRUKINSA and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise men to avoid fathering a child during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose.

If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Adverse reactions</span></b>

The most common adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, in = 30% of patients who received BRUKINSA (N = 847) included decreased neutrophil count (54%), upper respiratory tract infection (47%), decreased platelet count (41%), hemorrhage (35%), decreased lymphocyte count (31%), rash (31%) and musculoskeletal pain (30%).

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Drug Interactions</span></b>

<b>CYP3A Inhibitors:</b> When BRUKINSA is co-administered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg once daily. For coadministration with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, reduce BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg twice daily.

<b>CYP3A Inducers:</b> Avoid coadministration with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Specific Populations</span></b>

<b>Hepatic Impairment: </b>The recommended dose of BRUKINSA for patients with severe hepatic impairment is 80 mg orally twice daily.

OSAKA, Japan &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.takeda.com%2Finvestors%2F&amp;esheet=52492616&amp;newsitemid=20210915006101&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=TSE%3A4502%2FNYSE%3ATAK&amp;index=1&amp;md5=94a3d899be0e8de435c8228f4530d7e0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK</a>) (“Takeda”) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EXKIVITY (mobocertinib) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. EXKIVITY, which was granted priority review and received Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA, is the first and only approved oral therapy specifically designed to target EGFR Exon20 insertion mutations. This indication is approved under Accelerated Approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and DoR. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

“The approval of EXKIVITY introduces a new and effective treatment option for patients with EGFR Exon20 insertion+ NSCLC, fulfilling an urgent need for this difficult-to-treat cancer,” said Teresa Bitetti, president, Global Oncology Business Unit, Takeda. “EXKIVITY is the first and only oral therapy specifically designed to target EGFR Exon20 insertions, and we are particularly encouraged by the duration of the responses observed with a median of approximately 1.5 years. This approval milestone reinforces our commitment to meeting the needs of underserved patient populations within the oncology community.”

The FDA simultaneously approved Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Oncomine Dx Target Test as an NGS companion diagnostic for EXKIVITY to identify NSCLC patients with EGFR Exon20 insertions. NGS testing is critical for these patients, as it can enable more accurate diagnoses compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which detects less than 50% of EGFR Exon20 insertions.

“EGFR Exon20 insertion+ NSCLC is an underserved cancer that we have been unable to target effectively with traditional EGFR TKIs,” said Pasi A. Jänne, MD, PhD, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. “The approval of EXKIVITY (mobocertinib) marks another important step forward that provides physicians and their patients with a new targeted oral therapy specifically designed for this patient population that has shown clinically meaningful and sustained responses.”

“Patients with EGFR Exon20 insertion+ NSCLC have historically faced a unique set of challenges living with a very rare lung cancer that is not only underdiagnosed, but also lacking targeted treatment options that can improve response rates,” said Marcia Horn, executive director, Exon 20 Group at ICAN, International Cancer Advocacy Network. “As a patient advocate working with EGFR Exon20 insertion+ NSCLC patients and their families every day for nearly five years, I am thrilled to witness continued progress in the fight against this devastating disease and am grateful for the patients, families, healthcare professionals and scientists across the globe who contributed to the approval of this promising targeted therapy.”

The FDA approval is based on results from the platinum-pretreated population in the Phase 1/2 trial of EXKIVITY, which consisted of 114 patients with EGFR Exon20 insertion+ NSCLC who received prior platinum-based therapy and were treated at the 160 mg dose. Results were presented at the <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.takeda.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnewsreleases%2F2021%2Ftakeda-presents-updated-results-for-mobocertinib-further-substantiating-the-clinical-benefit-in-patients-with-egfr-exon20-insertion-mnsclc%2F&amp;esheet=52492616&amp;newsitemid=20210915006101&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=2021+American+Society+of+Clinical+Oncology+%28ASCO%29+Annual+Meeting&amp;index=2&amp;md5=7d9dbe6d27003ab91f64bf8e0250a3e8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting</a> from the Phase 1/2 trial and demonstrated a confirmed ORR of 28% per independent review committee (IRC) (35% per investigator) as well as a median DoR of 17.5 months per IRC, a median overall survival (OS) of 24 months and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.3 months per IRC.

The most common adverse reactions (&gt;20%) were diarrhea, rash, nausea, stomatitis, vomiting, decreased appetite, paronychia, fatigue, dry skin, and musculoskeletal pain. The EXKIVITY Prescribing Information includes a boxed warning for QTc prolongation and Torsades de Pointes, and warnings and precautions for interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, cardiac toxicity, and diarrhea.

The FDA review was conducted under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE), which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. We look forward to continuing our work with regulatory agencies across the globe to bring mobocertinib to patients.

<b>About EGFR Exon20 Insertion+ NSCLC
</b>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of the estimated 2.2 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed each year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.<sup>1,2</sup> Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon20 insertion+ NSCLC make up approximately 1-2% of patients with NSCLC, and the disease is more common in Asian populations compared to Western populations.<sup>3-7</sup> This disease carries a worse prognosis than other EGFR mutations, as EGFR TKIs – which do not specifically target EGFR Exon20 insertions – and chemotherapy provide limited benefit for these patients.

Takeda is committed to continuing research and development to meet the needs of the lung cancer community through the discovery and delivery of transformative medicines.

<b>EXKIVITY IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
<span class=""bwuline"">QTc Interval Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes</span>: EXKIVITY can cause life-threatening heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, including Torsades de Pointes, which can be fatal, and requires monitoring of QTc and electrolytes at baseline and periodically during treatment. Increase monitoring frequency in patients with risk factors for QTc prolongation. Avoid use of concomitant drugs which are known to prolong the QTc interval and use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with EXKIVITY, which may further prolong the QTc. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue EXKIVITY based on the severity of QTc prolongation.</b>

<span class=""bwuline"">Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis</span>: Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Immediately withhold EXKIVITY in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue EXKIVITY if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed.
<span class=""bwuline"">Cardiac Toxicity</span>: Monitor cardiac function, including left ventricular ejection fraction, at baseline and during treatment. Withhold, resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity.
<span class=""bwuline"">Diarrhea</span>: Diarrhea may lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalance, with or without renal impairment. Monitor electrolytes and advise patients to start an antidiarrheal agent at first episode of diarrhea and to increase fluid and electrolyte intake.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <a title=""Biogen Inc."" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_ATeR2VHxGjSU4xrjmjvuCIL89RMXDdSWmmqJ4Nh8pRRy5uqtWsnF1VBhKITzOz_AaHqXwBW8K2GK8HvJ3IjKA=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Biogen Inc.</a> (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced plans to initiate a global Phase 3b clinical study, ASCEND. The ASCEND study is designed to evaluate the clinical outcomes and assess the safety of a higher dose of nusinersen* in children, teens and adults with later-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) following treatment with Evrysdi<sup>®</sup> (risdiplam).

People with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the ongoing maintenance of motor neurons that support sitting, standing and movement. Over time, people with SMA may lose their ability to perform everyday activities, including brushing their teeth, turning on a light switch or drinking from a cup.<sup>4</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>5</sup> The goal of treatment in SMA is to sufficiently protect motor neurons and help preserve function.

“We believe that lower drug exposure may be contributing to less-than-optimal treatment outcomes for some patients treated with Evrysdi. The ASCEND study seeks to understand if nusinersen may address that unmet medical need and will help inform the future of SMA treatment, with the hope of improving patients’ outcomes for the long term,” said Maha Radhakrishnan, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Biogen.

Available data suggest that exposure to Evrysdi diminishes with increased age and weight, with an approximately 40 percent reduction in drug concentration in adults compared to infants.<sup>6,7</sup> Evrysdi’s dosing is capped at 5 milligrams (mg) once patients reach 20 kilograms (kg).<sup>8</sup>

At the approved 12-mg dose, motor neuron exposure to nusinersen remains similar as patients age and grow.<sup>9</sup> Further, nusinersen has demonstrated proven, sustained efficacy and a well-characterized safety profile, with long-term data in patients treated for more than 7 years across ages and SMA types. Taken together, these data support further exploration of whether a higher dose can deliver even greater efficacy to patients. The ASCEND study will assess if nusinersen at a higher dose may address outstanding clinical needs among later-onset SMA patients treated with Evrysdi who want to make a change in their treatment regimen. The same investigational higher dose of nusinersen is also being evaluated in the ongoing DEVOTE study.

“There have been significant advances in SMA treatment; however, there is still no cure and unmet medical needs remain,” said Professor Tim Hagenacker, Head of Neuromuscular Diseases Unit, Essen University in Germany, and a member of the ASCEND study steering committee. “As part of my clinical practice, we’ve observed an opportunity to potentially further improve patient outcomes. With a higher dose of nusinersen, we are positioned to explore what may be possible.”

The ASCEND protocol has been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is planned to be an approximately 2.5-year study projected to enroll up to 135 later-onset, non-ambulatory individuals with SMA (aged 5 to 39). All participants must have been previously treated with Evrysdi at the maximum recommended dose of 5 mg and be willing and able to change their treatment regimen to a higher dose of nusinersen. Participants must also fall within a particular Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) measurement range to enter the study. Individuals enrolled in ASCEND will receive two loading doses of nusinersen 50 mg two weeks apart, followed by a maintenance dose of 28 mg every four months during the study period. Efficacy is planned to be assessed by RULM. Additional clinical outcomes include safety, Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and caregiver burden. The study will also evaluate upper limb fine motor function in participants aged 13 and older using the mobile application Konectom™, and neurofilament levels as a marker of biological disease activity, both exploratory endpoints.

The study aims to include children, teens and adults naïve to treatment with nusinersen, as well as adults who were previously treated with nusinersen prior to Evrysdi. The company aims for the first eligible patients to be enrolled in 2021.

In addition to ASCEND, as a leader in SMA Biogen supports over 15 SMA disease registries with more than 4,000 patients across the globe, which will help support treatment decisions within the context of currently approved therapies, including the 12-mg dose of nusinersen.

<em>*Nusinersen is currently commercialized under the brand name SPINRAZA</em><sup><em>®</em></sup><em>, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved dose is 12 mg.</em>

<strong>About SPINRAZA</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (nusinersen)</strong>
The SPINRAZA clinical development program encompasses 10 clinical studies, which have included more than 300 individuals across a broad spectrum of patient populations,<sup>10</sup> including two randomized controlled studies (ENDEAR and CHERISH). The ongoing SHINE and NURTURE open-label extension studies are evaluating the long-term impact of SPINRAZA. The most common adverse events observed in clinical studies were respiratory infection, fever, constipation, headache, vomiting and back pain. Laboratory tests can monitor for renal toxicity and coagulation abnormalities, including acute severe low platelet counts, which have been observed after administration of some ASOs.

Biogen licensed the global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPINRAZA from Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: IONS), the leader in antisense therapeutics.

<strong>About Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)</strong>
SMA is a rare, genetic, neuromuscular disease that affects individuals of all ages. It is characterized by a loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in progressive muscle atrophy and weakness.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> SMA is caused by a deficiency in the production of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein due to a damaged or missing <em>SMN1</em> gene, with a spectrum of disease severity.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup> Some individuals with SMA may never sit; some sit but never walk; and some walk but may lose that ability over time.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> In the absence of treatment, children with the most severe form of SMA would not be expected to reach their second birthday.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>

SMA impacts approximately 1 in 11,000 live births,<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> is a leading cause of genetic death among infants<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> and causes a range of disability in teenagers and adults.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Clinical collaboration to assess HB-200 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) as first-line treatment
HOOKIPA poised to advance clinical development program with
randomized Phase 2 study in 2022
NEW YORK and VIENNA, Austria, Sept. 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — HOOKIPA Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOK, ‘HOOKIPA’), a company developing a new class of immunotherapeutics based on its proprietary arenavirus platform, today announced it has entered into a clinical collaboration and supply agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ., USA (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada) to evaluate the combination of HB-200, a novel arenaviral immunotherapeutic, and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ., USA’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) as first-line treatment for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

“Our collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ., USA, a proven immuno-oncology leader, is an important step as we advance our HB-200 program for the treatment of Human Papillomavirus 16-positive (HPV16+) cancers and seek to introduce a new class of immunotherapeutics,” said Joern Aldag, Chief Executive Officer at HOOKIPA. “There remains considerable unmet treatment need for people with metastatic head and neck cancers, and we believe the combination of HB-200 and KEYTRUDA may offer hope. We have seen encouraging early responses in heavily pre-treated patients with the addition of KEYTRUDA in our ongoing HB-200 trial. We are excited to explore the potential benefit of HB-200 as a first-line treatment in combination with KEYTRUDA, a leading anti-PD-1 inhibitor globally, and the possibility of making a meaningful impact on patients’ lives.”

The collaboration has been initiated based on promising data from the ongoing HB-200 Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT04180215) in advanced HPV16+ cancers. As reported at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, 15 patients with metastatic head and neck cancers were eligible for the efficacy analysis, as of data cut-off. HB-201 monotherapy showed an 18 percent overall response rate and median progression-free survival of 3.45 months in heavily pretreated head and neck cancer patients, better than current 2nd-line treatment. In addition, preliminary data on HB-201/HB-202 therapy showed a disease control rate of 100 percent (4/4 patients). Importantly, the Phase 1 data on 38 evaluable patients showed that HB-200 therapy has a favorable safety profile in heavily pre-treated patients with HPV16+ cancers, underlining its potential as a monotherapy and in possible combination with checkpoint inhibitors.

With a HB-200 program data read-out anticipated by Q4 2021, HOOKIPA anticipates initiating a Phase 2 trial with HB-200 in combination with KEYTRUDA in 2022. Additional Phase 2 expansion cohorts are also planned to start in Q1 2022.

KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.

About HB-200
HB-201 and HB-202 are HOOKIPA’s lead oncology candidates engineered with the company’s proprietary replicating arenaviral vector platform. Each single-vector compound uses a different arenavirus backbone (Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus for HB-201 and Pichinde virus for HB-202), while expressing the same antigen, an E7E6 fusion protein derived from HPV16. In pre-clinical studies, alternating administration of HB-201 and HB-202 resulted in a ten-fold increase in immune response and better disease control than either compound alone. HB-201 is being tested clinically as a single vector therapy and also in an alternating vector combination with HB-202.

About Human Papillomavirus
Human Papillomavirus, or HPV, is estimated to cause about 5 percent of the worldwide burden of cancers. This includes approximately 99 percent of cases in cervical, up to 60 percent of head and neck, 70 percent of vaginal and 88 percent of anal cancers.

The majority of these cancers are caused by the HPV serotype 16. Most infections with HPV are cleared from the body with no lasting consequences. However, in some cases, HPV DNA becomes integrated into chromosomal DNA. When host cells take up this DNA, they express the HPV E6 and E7 proteins. This uptake can potentially lead to cancer since expression of these proteins leads to alterations in cell cycle control, which in turn predisposes these cells to become cancerous.

About HOOKIPA
HOOKIPA Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOK) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel immunotherapies that mobilize and amplify targeted T cells and antibodies, the body’s natural infection killers, to fight or prevent serious disease.

HOOKIPA is developing a broad pipeline of potential first-in-class arenaviral immunotherapies in oncology and infectious disease. We are leveraging our proprietary, versatile platform to engineer arenaviral therapeutics that induce robust antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and pathogen-neutralizing antibodies to a broad range of self and non-self antigens, including viral antigens, tumor-associated antigens and neoantigens. Our immunotherapies are designed to use either non-replicating or replicating viral vectors based on the target disease, with the potential to induce CD8+ T cell response levels previously not achieved by other immunotherapy approaches.

HOOKIPA’s pipeline include ongoing clinical trials in Human Papilloma Virus 16-positive cancers and Cytomegalovirus, as well as preclinical research in prostate cancer, HIV and Hepatitis B. The latter two are in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc.

<p align=""justify"">RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Sept. 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: BCRX) today announced that the United Kingdom’s (UK) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended ORLADEYO<sup>®</sup> (berotralstat) for preventing recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in eligible patients 12 years and older if they have at least two attacks per month. With this recommendation, HAE patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will have access to the first oral, once-daily therapy for routine prevention of recurrent HAE attacks.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“HAE is a very rare genetic condition which is at best painful and debilitating, and can be fatal if left untreated. The unpredictability of the condition severely affects quality of life for patients and their families,” said Laura Szutowicz, chief executive officer of HAE UK. “HAE UK welcomes the NICE decision on berotralstat, which means that eligible patients and clinicians have another choice of treatment for this lifelong condition.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are excited for HAE patients that this recommendation from NICE provides access to the first oral, once-daily treatment for UK patients to achieve symptom control and experience relief from the burdens of HAE. The positive NICE recommendation also expands access to modern prophylaxis with ORLADEYO, compared to the attack frequency requirements from NICE for injectable options,” said Charlie Gayer, chief commercial officer of BioCryst.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The decision follows European Commission (EC) marketing authorization of ORLADEYO in April 2021 and approval from the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in May 2021. A decision from the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) for use of ORLADEYO for HAE patients in Scotland under the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is anticipated in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The NICE recommendation was based on findings from the Phase 3 APeX-2 trial, in which ORLADEYO met its primary endpoint, significantly reducing HAE attacks vs placebo at 24 weeks. This reduction was sustained through 96 weeks, with an 80 percent average reduction in patients’ mean attack rate per month during weeks 25-96 of the trial, compared to baseline, as demonstrated in long-term data presented at the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Hybrid Congress 2021. ORLADEYO was generally well-tolerated during the treatment period with fewer drug-related adverse events reported in part 3 (weeks 49-96) as compared to part 1 (weeks 0-24) and part 2 (weeks 25-48).</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The impact of HAE on patients goes beyond the potentially life-threatening swellings. It can also have a long-term effect on patients’ self-esteem and quality of life,” said Dr. Sorena Kiani, consultant immunologist at Barts Health NHS Trust. “The NICE recommendation of berotralstat is great news for clinicians and eligible patients who now have access to the first oral preventive treatment for HAE that could significantly reduce the number of attacks and may improve quality of life.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The UK Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) for ORLADEYO are available from the MHRA website at <a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0I3mIJwZDNjHkkdaeJr90fsNLNe_MpbEEEzCCNXeiiDQEaMRD_tinPJqbm52DP1d4i84Qh-507UC_P8fWD90HYLy5P_5ZXjoZv7gq4jqXAA="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>https://products.mhra.gov.uk/</u></a>.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About ORLADEYO</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (berotralstat)</strong>
ORLADEYO<sup>®</sup> (berotralstat) is the first and only oral therapy designed specifically to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. One capsule of ORLADEYO per day works to prevent HAE attacks by decreasing the activity of plasma kallikrein.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>U.S. Indication and Important Safety Information</strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>INDICATION</strong>
ORLADEYO<sup>®</sup> (berotralstat) is a plasma kallikrein inhibitor indicated for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Limitations of use</strong>
The safety and effectiveness of ORLADEYO for the treatment of acute HAE attacks have not been established. ORLADEYO should not be used for the treatment of acute HAE attacks. Additional doses or dosages of ORLADEYO higher than 150 mg once daily are not recommended due to the potential for QT prolongation.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>
An increase in QT prolongation was observed at dosages higher than the recommended 150 mg once-daily dosage and was concentration dependent.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The most common adverse reactions (=10% and higher than placebo) in patients receiving ORLADEYO were abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, back pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.</p>
<p align=""justify"">A reduced dosage of 110 mg taken orally once daily with food is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) and in patients taking chronically administered P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors (eg, cyclosporine).</p>
<p align=""justify"">Berotralstat is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. P-gp inducers (eg, rifampin, St. John’s wort) may decrease berotralstat plasma concentration, leading to reduced efficacy of ORLADEYO. The use of P-gp inducers is not recommended with ORLADEYO.</p>
<p align=""justify"">ORLADEYO at a dose of 150 mg is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. For concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP3A4, appropriate monitoring and dose titration is recommended. ORLADEYO at a dose of 300 mg is a P-gp inhibitor. Appropriate monitoring and dose titration is recommended for P-gp substrates (eg, digoxin) when coadministering with ORLADEYO.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The safety and effectiveness of ORLADEYO in pediatric patients &lt;12 years of age have not been established. There are insufficient data available to inform drug-related risks with ORLADEYO use in pregnancy. There are no data on the presence of berotralstat in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant, or its effects on milk production.</p>

<span class=""xn-location"">THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 16, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) today announced the first combination study results from the Phase <span class=""xn-money"">1b</span>/2 CodeBreaK 101 study, the most comprehensive global clinical development program in patients with <i>KRAS</i> G12C-mutated advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). These new data show that combining LUMAKRAS™ (sotorasib) with Vectibix<sup>®</sup> (panitumumab), Amgen's monoclonal antibody epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety. Overall, the objective response rate (ORR) was 27% (confirmed and unconfirmed) among 26 patients in the efficacy analysis set (which included 5 patients who had progressed with prior sotorasib monotherapy). The disease control rate (DCR) was 81%. ORR and DCR were secondary endpoints. In the expansion cohort of sotorasib-naïve patients with refractory CRC (n=18), 33% of patients experienced a response (confirmed and unconfirmed). These data are being featured during the European Society of Medical Oncology 2021 (ESMO21) Virtual Congress.

""We are excited by these CodeBreaK 101 data, which show encouraging response rates that were much higher than the 9.7% response rate observed with LUMAKRAS monotherapy and highlight the importance of combination therapy for patients with <i>KRAS</i> G12C-mutated advanced colorectal cancer,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">David M. Reese</span>, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Based on these results and the urgent need for new therapies, we are pleased to announce the initiation of a new Phase 3 trial with LUMAKRAS plus Vectibix in the third-line setting. This new trial, along with our doublet and triplet combination trials in colorectal cancer, demonstrates our commitment to delivering a new treatment option for metastatic CRC patients who harbor the <i>KRAS</i> G12C mutation.""

In total, 31 patients with heavily pretreated (median of two prior lines of therapy; range 1-10) <i>KRAS</i> G12C-mutated metastatic CRC were enrolled in the dose exploration and dose expansion cohorts for the combination of LUMAKRAS and Vectibix. No patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities during the 28 days following initial treatment. The majority of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were Grade 1-2 in severity, and no Grade 4 or fatal TRAEs were observed. The most common TRAEs (occurring in &gt; 10% of patients) were consistent with known adverse events for LUMAKRAS and Vectibix and included dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, nausea, diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, pruritus and rash. No new safety concerns were identified.

""With treatment response rates being as low as 2% in patients with colorectal cancer who progress in advanced stages, developing new treatment approaches for these patients is of critical interest,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Marwan G. Fakih</span>, M.D., primary study investigator and co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program, City of Hope, <span class=""xn-location"">Duarte, Calif.</span> ""Preclinical research has indicated that the addition of an EGFR inhibitor to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition can be synergistic, and now we have the first clinical data indicating the combination of sotorasib and panitumumab has the potential to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with <i>KRAS</i> G12C-mutated advanced CRC.""

<b>Advancing Tarlatamab (formerly AMG 757) and AMG 404 in Small Cell Lung Cancer<br class=""dnr"" /></b>In addition to the LUMAKRAS combination research, a presentation will detail the design of an ongoing study of half-life extended (HLE) bispecific T cell engager (BiTE<sup>®</sup>) molecule tarlatamab with anti-PD-1 antibody AMG 404 in patients with small cell lung cancer. The multicenter, open-label, Phase <span class=""xn-money"">1b</span> study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination and determine dosing as primary objectives, as well as examine preliminary antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics as secondary objectives.

<b>About LUMAKRAS<sup>TM</sup> (sotorasib)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Amgen took on one of the toughest challenges of the last 40 years in cancer research by developing LUMAKRAS, a KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor.<sup>1</sup> LUMAKRAS has demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile with rapid, deep and durable anticancer activity in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation with a once daily oral formulation.<sup>2</sup>

In <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2021</span>, LUMAKRAS was the first KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world with its approval in the U.S., under accelerated approval. LUMAKRAS is also approved in the <span class=""xn-location"">United Arab Emirates</span>, and in <span class=""xn-location"">Great Britain</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> under Project Orbis.

Amgen is progressing the largest and broadest global KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor development program with unparalleled speed and exploring more than 10 sotorasib combination regimens, including triplets, with clinical trial sites spanning five continents. To date, LUMAKRAS has treated almost 3,000 patients around the world through the clinical development program and commercial use.

In the U.S., LUMAKRAS was reviewed by the FDA under its Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR), a pilot program that aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible. Amgen is participating in the FDA's Project Orbis initiative and through the initiative, has Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) for sotorasib in review in <span class=""xn-location"">Australia</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Brazil</span>. Additionally, Amgen has submitted an MAA in the European Union, <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Switzerland</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">South Korea</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Singapore</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Israel</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Turkey</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Taiwan</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Colombia</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Thailand</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Mexico</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Hong Kong</span>.

LUMAKRAS is also being studied in multiple other solid tumors.<sup>1</sup>

<b>About CodeBreaK<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen's drug sotorasib is designed to treat patients with an advanced solid tumor with the <i>KRAS </i>G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers. As the most advanced KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor clinical development program, CodeBreaK has enrolled more than 800 patients across 13 tumor types since its inception.

CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutant solid tumors. Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The Phase 2 trial in NSCLC enrolled 126 patients, 124 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline. The Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer (CRC) is fully enrolled and results have been submitted for publication.

A global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutated NSCLC (CodeBreaK 200) has completed enrollment. Amgen also has several Phase <span class=""xn-money"">1b</span> studies investigating sotorasib monotherapy and sotorasib combination therapy across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment. A Phase 2 randomized study will evaluate sotorasib in patients with stage IV <i>KRAS</i> G12C-mutated NSCLC in need of first-line treatment (CodeBreaK 201).

<b>About Advanced Colorectal Cancer and the <i>KRAS </i>G12C Mutation<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, comprising 10% of all cancer diagnoses.<sup>3</sup> It is also the third most commonly diagnosed cancer globally.<sup>4</sup>

Patients with previously treated metastatic CRC need more effective treatment options, as standard therapies yield median PFS times of about two months and patients' response rates are less than 2%.<sup> 5,6</sup>

KRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in colorectal cancers, with the <i>KRAS</i> G12C mutation present in approximately 3-5% of colorectal cancers.<sup>7,8,9</sup>

<b>About BiTE<sup>®</sup> Technology<br class=""dnr"" /></b>BiTE<sup>®</sup> (bispecific T cell engager) technology is a targeted immuno-oncology platform that is designed to engage a patient's own T cells to any tumor-specific antigen, activating the cytotoxic potential of T cells to eliminate detectable cancer. The BiTE immuno-oncology platform has the potential to treat different tumor types through tumor-specific antigens. The BiTE platform has a goal of leading to off-the-shelf solutions, which have the potential to make innovative T cell treatment available to all providers when their patients need it. Amgen is advancing BiTE molecules across a broad range of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors and further investigating BiTE technology with the goal of enhancing patient experience and therapeutic potential.

<b>LUMAKRAS<sup>TM</sup> (sotorasib) U.S. Indication<br class=""dnr"" /></b>LUMAKRAS<sup>TM</sup> is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with <i>KRAS </i>G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

<b>About Vectibix<sup>®</sup> (panitumumab)</b>

Vectibix is the first fully human monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody approved by the FDA for the treatment of mCRC. Vectibix was approved in the U.S. in September 2006 as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC after disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.

In May 2014, the FDA approved Vectibix for use in combination with FOLFOX, as first-line treatment in patients with wild-type <i>KRAS</i> (exon 2) mCRC. With this approval, Vectibix became the first-and-only biologic therapy indicated for use with FOLFOX, one of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens, in the first-line treatment of mCRC for patients with wild-type <i>KRAS</i> mCRC.

In June 2017, the FDA approved a refined indication for Vectibix for use in in patients with wild-type <i>RAS</i> (defined as wild-type in both <i>KRAS</i> and <i>NRAS</i> as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use<i>) </i>mCRC.

<b>INDICATION AND LIMITATION OF USE</b>

Vectibix<sup>®</sup> is indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type <i>RAS </i>(defined as wild-type in both <i>KRAS </i>and <i>NRAS </i>as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC): as first-line therapy in combination with FOLFOX, and as monotherapy following disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.

Limitation of Use: Vectibix<sup>®</sup> is not indicated for the treatment of patients with <i>RAS </i>mutant mCRC or for whom <i>RAS </i>mutation status is unknown.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>BOXED WARNING: DERMATOLOGIC TOXICITY</b>

<b><u>Dermatologic Toxicity:</u></b><b> Dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients receiving Vectibix monotherapy </b><i>[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</i>
<ul>
 	<li>In Study 20020408, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients with mCRC receiving Vectibix<sup>®</sup>. The clinical manifestations included, but were not limited to, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, erythema, rash, skin exfoliation, paronychia, dry skin, and skin fissures.</li>
 	<li>Monitor patients who develop dermatologic or soft tissue toxicities while receiving Vectibix<sup>®</sup> for the development of inflammatory or infectious sequelae. Life-threatening and fatal infectious complications including necrotizing fasciitis, abscesses, and sepsis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix<sup>®</sup>. Life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing has also been observed in patients treated with Vectibix<sup>®</sup>. It could not be determined whether these mucocutaneous adverse reactions were directly related to EGFR inhibition or to idiosyncratic immune- related effects (e.g., Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis). Withhold or discontinue Vectibix<sup>®</sup> for dermatologic or soft tissue toxicity associated with severe or life-threatening inflammatory or infectious complications. Dose modifications for Vectibix<sup>®</sup> concerning dermatologic toxicity are provided in the product labeling.</li>
 	<li>Vectibix<sup>®</sup> is not indicated for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer that harbor somatic <i>RAS </i>mutations in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) of either <i>KRAS </i>or <i>NRAS </i>and hereafter is referred to as ""<i>RAS.</i>""</li>
 	<li>Retrospective subset analyses across several randomized clinical trials were conducted to investigate the role of <i>RAS </i>mutations on the clinical effects of anti-EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies (panitumumab or cetuximab). Anti-EGFR antibodies in patients with tumors containing <i>RAS </i>mutations resulted in exposing those patients to anti-EGFR related adverse reactions without clinical benefit from these agents. Additionally, in Study 20050203, 272 patients with <i>RAS</i>-mutant mCRC tumors received Vectibix<sup>®</sup> in combination with FOLFOX and 276 patients received FOLFOX alone. In an exploratory subgroup analysis<i>, </i>OS was shorter (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.45) in patients with <i>RAS</i>-mutant mCRC who received Vectibix<sup>®</sup> and FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone.</li>
 	<li>Progressively decreasing serum magnesium levels leading to severe (grade 3-4) hypomagnesemia occurred in up to 7% (in Study 20080763) of patients across clinical trials. Monitor patients for hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating Vectibix<sup>®</sup> treatment, periodically during Vectibix<sup>®</sup> treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after the completion of treatment. Other electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, have also been observed. Replete magnesium and other electrolytes as appropriate.</li>
 	<li>In Study 20020408, 4% of patients experienced infusion reactions and 1% of patients experienced severe infusion reactions (NCI-CTC grade 3-4). Infusion reactions, manifesting as fever, chills, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypotension, can occur following Vectibix<sup>®</sup> administration. Fatal infusion reactions occurred in postmarketing experience. Terminate the infusion for severe infusion reactions.</li>
 	<li>Severe diarrhea and dehydration, leading to acute renal failure and other complications, have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix<sup>®</sup> in combination with chemotherapy.</li>
 	<li>Fatal and nonfatal cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (1%) and pulmonary fibrosis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix<sup>®</sup>. Pulmonary fibrosis occurred in less than 1% (2/1467) of patients enrolled in clinical studies of Vectibix<sup>®</sup>. In the event of acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms interrupt Vectibix<sup>®</sup> therapy. Discontinue Vectibix<sup>®</sup> therapy if ILD is confirmed.</li>
 	<li>In patients with a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, the benefits of therapy with Vectibix<sup>®</sup> versus the risk of pulmonary complications must be carefully considered.</li>
 	<li>Exposure to sunlight can exacerbate dermatologic toxicity. Advise patients to wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun exposure while receiving Vectibix<sup>®</sup>.</li>
 	<li>Keratitis and serious cases of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis, known risk factors for and corneal perforation, have occurrred with Vectibix use. Monitor for evidence of keratitis , ulcerative keratitis, or corneal perforation. Interrupt or discontinue Vectibix therapy for acute or worsening keratitis, ulcerative keratitis, or corneal perforation.</li>
 	<li>In an interim analysis of an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial in the first-line setting in patients with mCRC, the addition of Vectibix<sup>®</sup> to the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy resulted in decreased OS and increased incidence of NCI-CTC grade 3-5 (87% vs 72%) adverse reactions. NCI-CTC grade 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher rate in Vectibix<sup>®</sup>-treated patients included rash/acneiform dermatitis (26% vs 1%), diarrhea (23% vs 12%), dehydration (16% vs 5%), primarily occurring in patients with diarrhea, hypokalemia (10% vs 4%), stomatitis/mucositis (4% vs &lt; 1%), and hypomagnesemia (4% vs 0).</li>
 	<li>NCI-CTC grade 3-5 pulmonary embolism occurred at a higher rate in Vectibix<sup>®</sup>-treated patients (7% vs 3%) and included fatal events in three (&lt; 1%) Vectibix<sup>®</sup>-treated patients. As a result of the toxicities experienced, patients randomized to Vectibix<sup>®</sup>, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy received a lower mean relative dose intensity of each chemotherapeutic agent (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bolus 5-FU, and/or infusional 5-FU) over the first 24 weeks on study compared with those randomized to bevacizumab and chemotherapy.</li>
 	<li>Vectibix<sup>®</sup> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for at least 2 months after the last dose of Vectibix<sup>®</sup>.</li>
 	<li>In monotherapy, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (= 20%) in patients with Vectibix<sup>®</sup> were skin rash with variable presentations, paronychia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.</li>
 	<li>The most commonly reported adverse reactions (= 20%) with Vectibix<sup>®</sup> + FOLFOX were diarrhea, stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, paronychia, anorexia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, rash, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, and dry skin.

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in <span class=""xn-location"">Puerto Rico</span>, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations.

<span class=""bw-dateline-wrapper"">PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span>Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) plus <i>Yervoy</i> (ipilimumab) continued to demonstrate durable, long-term survival in the Phase 3 CheckMate -214 trial, with a five-year survival rate of 48% in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). After a median follow-up of 67.7 months, <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy </i>maintained superior overall survival (OS) and response benefits versus sunitinib in both patients with intermediate- and poor-risk prognostic factors, the primary endpoint population, and across all randomized patients.

In intermediate- and poor-risk patients (n=847), <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> (n=425) maintained treatment effects over five years, with ongoing improvements in OS and overall response rate (ORR), two of the trial’s primary endpoints, as well as in supportive endpoints:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>OS: The median OS was 47.0 months for intermediate- and poor-risk patients treated with<i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i>versus 26.6 months with sunitinib (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.68; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.58 to 0.81), and five-year survival rates were 43% and 31%, respectively.</li>
 	<li>ORR: ORR benefits were maintained with <i>Opdivo</i>plus <i>Yervoy</i> compared to sunitinib (42% vs. 27%). In addition, more patients treated with the combination<i></i>achieved complete responses (11% vs. 2%).</li>
 	<li>Duration of response (DOR): For patients treated with <i>Opdivo</i>plus <i>Yervoy</i>, median DOR was not reached, compared to 19.7 months with sunitinib.</li>
</ul>
An analysis of all randomized patients, or the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (n=1,096), similarly showed long-term benefits with <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy </i>(n=550):
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>OS: <i>Opdivo</i>plus <i>Yervoy</i>demonstrated a median OS of 55.7 months in the ITT population, representing the longest survival outcome reported to date in a Phase 3 trial in advanced RCC, compared to 38.4 months with sunitinib (HR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.85). Five-year OS rates were 48% for patients treated with the dual immunotherapy combination and 37% for those receiving sunitinib.</li>
 	<li>ORR: <i>Opdivo</i>plus <i>Yervoy</i> continued to show a higher ORR (39% vs. 32%) and complete response rate than sunitinib (12% vs. 3%). Also, more patients treated with the combination<i></i>achieved complete responses and subsequently did not progress (9.6% vs. 2.4%).</li>
 	<li>DOR: Median DOR was not reached with <i>Opdivo</i>plus <i>Yervoy</i> and was 24.8 months with sunitinib.</li>
</ul>
The safety profile of <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> was manageable using established treatment algorithms, and no new safety signals emerged with extended follow-up. These data were published online during the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2021 on September 16, 2021, 08:30 CEST (Abstract #661P).

“The five-year data from the CheckMate -214 trial demonstrate that nearly half of patients lived longer after five years in this Phase 3 trial for advanced renal cell carcinoma,” said Robert J. Motzer, M.D., CheckMate -214 investigator and Kidney Cancer Section Head, Genitourinary Oncology Service, Jack and Dorothy Byrne Chair in Clinical Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “While the median duration of response has not yet been reached with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, the data show some durable effects of this combination for patients living with this disease.”

“Four years ago, we presented the first results from CheckMate -214 during ESMO, which helped to transform the standard of care in advanced renal cell carcinoma. Now, with the longest follow-up for any Phase 3 trial of an immunotherapy combination in this disease, we’re seeing truly long-term survival benefits with <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy</i>,” said Dana Walker, M.D., M.S.C.E., vice president, development program lead, genitourinary cancers, Bristol Myers Squibb. “These five-year results in renal cell carcinoma add to the evidence we have seen in several other tumor types of the unique role that <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i>-based combinations can play in changing survival outcomes for patients with cancer.”

The five-year data from CheckMate -214 presented during ESMO also included conditional survival analyses, which estimate the probability of remaining event-free (i.e., remaining alive, progression-free or in response) for a period of time after a patient reaches a milestone in their treatment. Key findings included:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Patients who were alive three years after starting treatment with <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> had an 81% probability of remaining alive for an additional two years, compared to 72% with sunitinib.</li>
 	<li>Patients who were progression-free three years after starting treatment with the dual immunotherapy combination had an 89% probability of remaining progression-free for an additional two years, compared to 57% with sunitinib.</li>
 	<li>Patients who responded to treatment with the combination and remained in response for three years had an 89% probability of remaining in response for two additional years vs. 63% with sunitinib.</li>
</ul>
Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the CheckMate -214 clinical trial.

<i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i>-based combinations have shown significant improvements in OS in six Phase 3 clinical trials in five tumors to date: advanced renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CheckMate -214</span></b>

CheckMate -214 is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study evaluating the combination of <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Patients in the combination group (n=550) received <i>Opdivo</i> 3 mg/kg plus <i>Yervoy</i> 1 mg/kg every three weeks for four doses followed by <i>Opdivo</i> 3 mg/kg every two weeks. Patients in the comparator group (n=546) received sunitinib 50 mg once daily for four weeks, followed by two weeks off before continuation of treatment. Patients were treated until progression or unacceptable toxic effects for up to two years. The primary endpoints of the trial are overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) in an intermediate- to poor-risk patient population (approximately 75% of patients). ORR was assessed by independent radiology review committee (IRRC).

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Renal Cell Carcinoma</span></b>

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for more than 431,000 new cases and 179,000 deaths worldwide each year. RCC is approximately twice as common in men as in women, with the highest rates of the disease in North America and Europe. Historically, the five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with metastatic, or advanced, kidney cancer is 13%.

Because as a leader in cancer care, Bristol Myers Squibb is working to empower all people with cancer to have a better future.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Opdivo</i></span></b>

<i>Opdivo</i> is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, <i>Opdivo</i> has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.

<i>Opdivo</i>’s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the <i>Opdivo</i> clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The <i>Opdivo</i> trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from <i>Opdivo</i> across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.

In July 2014, <i>Opdivo</i> was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. <i>Opdivo</i> is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Yervoy </i>combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Yervoy</i></span></b>

<i>Yervoy</i> is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. <i>Yervoy</i> binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <i>Yervoy</i> 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. <i>Yervoy</i> is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for <i>Yervoy</i> spanning multiple tumor types.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 7% (31/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.0%), and Grade 2 (4.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). In NSCLC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%). Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis.

In Checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO, including Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=12).

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis.

<strong>Ingelheim, Germany – 16 September 2021</strong> – Boehringer Ingelheim today announced a clinical phase I collaboration with Amgen to evaluate the combination of BI 1701963, the first and most advanced SOS1::pan-KRAS inhibitor exhibiting activity against a broad spectrum of KRAS alleles, and LUMAKRAS<sup class=""footnote"">™</sup> (sotorasib), the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The trial will investigate potential synergistic effects of this combination, possibly improving therapeutic outcomes beyond those of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor therapy alone, specifically for people living with lung and colorectal cancers.

Preclinical data suggest that the combination of a KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor with a SOS1::pan-KRAS inhibitor may result in increased anti-tumor activity in KRAS G12C-driven cancers based on the complementary mechanisms of these targeted oncology agents.<sup>1,2 </sup>By shifting the equilibrium from active KRAS towards the inactive form, SOS1::pan-KRAS inhibitors have the potential to sensitize KRAS G12C-mutant tumors to covalent KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors that bind to inactive KRAS. In addition, SOS1 inhibitors block feedback reactivation which occurs upon pathway inhibition.

“We are excited to partner with Amgen, who have pioneered KRAS G12C inhibition, and to further expand our program to make a difference for people living with KRAS-driven cancers,” said Francesco Di Marco, Ph.D., Corporate Senior Vice President, Global Therapy Area Head Oncology  at Boehringer Ingelheim. “Boehringer Ingelheim follows an ‘all-in’ research approach to taking cancer on, including the first and most advanced SOS1::pan-KRAS inhibitor which we investigate in several combinations and cancer types to realize even more opportunities to deliver potential therapeutic benefits to cancer patients.”

Under the terms of the non-exclusive collaboration, Amgen will be the sponsor of the trial and Boehringer Ingelheim and Amgen will jointly share the costs of and oversee clinical development for the combined therapy.

<strong>About BI 1701963</strong>
BI 1701963 is an investigational, orally available small molecule, that binds to the catalytic domain of SOS1 preventing the interaction with inactive KRAS. This reduces the formation of active KRAS and in consequence inhibits MAPK pathway signaling in KRAS-dependent cancers. SOS1 inhibition also simultaneously blocks feedback driven reactivation of the MAPK pathway. The selective inhibition of SOS1 is a therapeutic concept that could allow KRAS blockade irrespective of KRAS mutation type (pan-KRAS approach). SOS1::KRAS inhibitors exhibit activity on a broad spectrum of KRAS alleles, including all major G12D/V/C and G13D oncoproteins, as published by Hofmann MH, et al. in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR). BI 1701963 is currently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials in patients with advanced KRAS-mutated cancers to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and preliminary efficacy of BI 1701963 alone and in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS<sup>G12C </sup>inhibitors or irinotecan.

NORTHBROOK, Ill. and MONTREAL, Sept. 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clarus Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (“Clarus”) (Nasdaq:CRXT), a pharmaceutical company dedicated to providing solutions to unmet medical needs by advancing androgen and metabolic therapies for men and women, and McGill University (“McGill”), Canada’s top ranked medical doctoral university, today announced a licensing agreement whereby Clarus will develop and commercialize McGill’s proprietary technology designed to treat conditions associated with CoQ<sub>10</sub> deficiencies in humans.

CoQ<sub>10</sub> is synthesized in the inner membrane of mitochondria, a cellular organelle whose primary function is to produce the body’s chemical energy. Deficiencies of CoQ<sub>10 </sub>can lead to severe multiple organ dysfunctions that involve the brain, nerves, kidneys, heart, GI tract and muscle. Oral CoQ<sub>10</sub> is largely ineffective because it does not result in intracellular uptake of CoQ<sub>10</sub>. McGill has identified a method to substantially increase such uptake, thereby forming the basis for a new, and potentially profound, method of addressing deficiencies of CoQ<sub>10</sub>.

“This collaboration with world-renowned McGill University expands our focus beyond androgen-based medicines to a metabolic therapy for CoQ<sub>10</sub> deficiencies that have very limited treatment options,” said Dr. Robert Dudley, Clarus’s Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Knowing the role McGill’s discovery may have to address this important, unmet medical need is a terrific opportunity, and we are excited to get started.”

McGill’s discovery, a combination of CoQ<sub>10</sub> plus caspofungin (an FDA-approved antifungal drug for adults and children), was made by Dr. Siegfried Hekimi and his colleague, Dr. Ying Wang. Dr. Hekimi is a Professor of Biology and holds the Robert Archibald &amp; Catherine Louise Campbell Chair in Developmental Biology. He is an expert in aging research and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, which awarded him the Flavelle Medal for his outstanding contribution to biological science.

“Deficiencies of CoQ<sub>10</sub> are a major medical challenge, and I am delighted that a discovery from my laboratory has been licensed by Clarus,” said Dr. Hekimi. “We look forward to working with the excellent team at Clarus to bring forward a treatment that could be potentially game changing for individuals afflicted with a severe lack of CoQ<sub>10</sub> as well as individuals with other mitochondrial disease.”

<strong>Terms of the Agreement</strong>
Under the terms of the licensing agreement, Clarus will pay McGill a one-time upfront payment of $350,000 and up to $10.5 million in potential development and regulatory milestone payments. Additionally, McGill would be eligible for up to $30 million in potential commercial milestone payments. The success-based milestones denote important steps associated with building value for these programs.

<strong>About Mitochondrial Diseases</strong>
Mitochondrial diseases are chronic, genetic diseases that occur when the mitochondria, structures in our body cells that produce energy from oxygen and food, fail to function properly. Mitochondrial diseases can affect almost any area of the body and can occur at any age, making them often misdiagnosed. It is estimated that approximately one in 5,000 adults worldwide has a mitochondrial disease.

</ul>
<strong>Limitation of use</strong>
Safety and efficacy of JATENZO in males less than 18 years old have not been established.

<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>

<strong>WARNING: INCREASES IN BLOOD PRESSURE</strong>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>JATENZO can cause blood pressure (BP) increases that can increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Before initiating JATENZO, consider the patient’s baseline cardiovascular risk and ensure blood pressure is adequately controlled.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Periodically monitor for and treat new-onset hypertension or exacerbations of pre-existing hypertension and re-evaluate whether the benefits of JATENZO outweigh its risks in patients who develop cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease on treatment.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Due to this risk, use JATENZO only for the treatment of men with hypogonadal conditions associated with structural or genetic etiologies.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS</strong>
JATENZO is contraindicated in men with breast cancer or known or suspected prostate cancer. JATENZO is contraindicated in women who are pregnant as testosterone may cause fetal harm.

<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Check hematocrit prior to initiation and every 3 months while a patient is on JATENZO and if hematocrit becomes elevated, stop JATENZO until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. If hematocrit increases after JATENZO is restarted, stop permanently.</li>
 	<li>Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treated with androgens due to an increased risk for worsening signs and symptoms of BPH.</li>
 	<li>Venous thromboembolic events (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), have been reported in patients using testosterone replacement products like JATENZO. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE and, if a VTE is suspected, discontinue JATENZO and initiate appropriate workup and management.</li>
 	<li>Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids.</li>
 	<li>Large doses of androgens can suppress spermatogenesis by feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH. Inform patients of this risk before prescribing JATENZO.</li>
 	<li>Prolonged use of high doses of methyltestosterone has been associated with serious hepatic adverse events. JATENZO is not known to cause these adverse events; however, patients should be instructed to report any signs of hepatic dysfunction and JATENZO should be discontinued while the cause is evaluated.</li>
 	<li>Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required.</li>
 	<li>Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated for hypogonadism.</li>
 	<li>Sleep apnea may occur in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung disease.</li>
 	<li>Changes in the serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment of lipid-lowering drugs or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy.</li>
 	<li>Use JATENZO with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia. Monitor serum calcium concentration regularly during treatment with JATENZO in these patients.</li>
 	<li>Androgens, including JATENZO, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.</li>
 	<li>Depression and suicidal ideation have been reported in patients treated with JATENZO in clinical trials.</li>
</ul>
<strong>ADVERSE EVENTS</strong>
The most common adverse events of JATENZO (incidence =2%) are headache (5%), increased hematocrit (5%), hypertension (4%), decreased HDL (3%), and nausea (2%).

<h3 class=""subhead-gnw"">Vixotrigine, a non-opioid investigational pain drug, has the potential to address significant unmet medical needs of individuals living with chronic painful neuropathy</h3>
<p align=""left"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced positive topline results from its Phase 2 CONVEY study of vixotrigine (BIIB074), a non-opioid investigational oral pain drug being evaluated for the treatment of small fiber neuropathy (SFN).</p>
The CONVEY study 200 mg twice daily arm met its primary endpoint of change from baseline to week 12 of the double-blind period in mean average daily pain (ADP) score. In this study, all participants who enrolled received the higher dose (350 mg twice daily) in an open-label portion which preceded the double-blind portion of the study. While the 350 mg twice daily arm did not meet the primary endpoint, it met statistical significance in the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at week 12, an important self-reported measure of a patient’s overall improvement since with the start of the study. The totality of data from the vixotrigine program will inform potential doses for study in future Phase 3 clinical trials. There is a significant unmet need for non-opioid treatments for people suffering from chronic neuropathic pain.

Small fiber neuropathy is often characterized by severe pain that typically begins in the feet or hands. Painful symptoms are described as burning, shooting and/or prickling. Pain can be caused by stimuli that does not normally provoke pain (allodynia) and potentially painful stimuli are increased in intensity (hyperalgesia). Symptoms tend to be worse at night and during periods of rest and can lead to a significant impact on overall quality of life.

“We are encouraged by the overall results of the CONVEY study, especially given the significant unmet medical need for additional agents to treat chronic painful neuropathy,” said Katherine Dawson, M.D., Senior Vice President, and Head of the Therapeutics Development Unit at Biogen. “We are grateful to all the participants, investigators and study staff who contributed to this study and allowed us to evaluate vixotrigine as a non-opioid treatment option for people living with chronic neuropathic pain due to small fiber neuropathy.”

<strong>CONVEY Topline Study Results</strong>
CONVEY was a Phase 2 placebo-controlled, double-blind, enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of vixotrigine in treating pain experienced by participants with confirmed idiopathic or diabetes mellitus-associated small fiber neuropathy. Statistical testing to compare each vixotrigine dose with placebo was pre-defined at the 10% significance level without multiplicity adjustment.

Vixotrigine 200 mg twice daily resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the mean average daily pain (ADP) score versus placebo at week 12 (p=0.0501). Treatment effect was noted in participants with diabetes mellitus based on a subgroup analysis but was not evident in the smaller subgroup of patients with idiopathic SFN. The 200 mg dose also resulted in statistically significant improvement versus placebo on the mean worst daily pain score at week 12 (p=0.0455). Numeric advantage of 200 mg over placebo was observed in additional secondary endpoints, including the proportion of participants with a 2-point or greater improvement in the average daily pain score and the proportion of participants with =30% reduction in ADP at week 12, but these did not meet statistical significance.

Vixotrigine 350 mg twice daily did not meet the primary endpoint of mean change in ADP at week 12. However, treatment with 350 mg vixotrigine resulted in a statistically significant increase in the proportion of participants who reported they were “very much improved” or “much improved” when compared to baseline, using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaire (p=0.0580). In addition, numeric advantage of 350 mg over placebo was observed in some secondary endpoints, including the proportion of participants with a 2-point or greater improvement in the average daily pain score and the proportion of participants with =30% reduction in ADP at week 12, but these did not meet statistical significance.

Both doses of vixotrigine were generally well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previous studies of vixotrigine with no evidence of abuse potential. In the open-label period, common AEs (incidence = 2.5%) were dizziness, headache, vertigo, and nausea. 5.3% of subjects discontinued the open-label part of the study due to adverse events; across the entire study the majority of the AEs were mild or moderate in severity.

Biogen will further evaluate the CONVEY data and plans to complete a Phase 1 clinical study to inform potential next steps in the development of vixotrigine. In addition, detailed results from the CONVEY study will be made available in a future scientific forum.

<strong>About vixotrigine (BIIB074)</strong>
Vixotrigine (BIIB074) is an investigational peripherally and centrally acting, orally administered, voltage- and use-dependent voltage-gated sodium channel blocker. Sodium channels are important for nerve impulse conduction, including within pain-sensitive neurons which respond to tissue damage and within the pain pathway in the spinal cord and brain.

<strong>About the CONVEY Study</strong><strong> (NCT03339336)</strong>
CONVEY was a Phase 2 placebo-controlled, double-blind, enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal study that enrolled 265 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vixotrigine (BIIB074) in treating pain experienced by participants with confirmed small fiber neuropathy that is idiopathic or associated with diabetes mellitus. After a 4-week open-label run-in period, 123 responders to vixotrigine were randomized to receive either 200 mg or 350 mg vixotrigine or placebo twice-daily for 12 weeks in the double-blind portion of the study.

The primary objective of the study is based on change from baseline to week 12 of the double-blind period in the mean average daily pain score on an 11-point numeric rating scale. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect on worst pain, neuropathic pain quality, sleep interference due to pain, patient global impression, use of rescue medication, and SFN symptoms in participants treated with vixotrigine; to investigate the safety and tolerability of vixotrigine in participants with SFN; and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of vixotrigine in participants with SFN.

<strong>About small fiber neuropathy (SFN)</strong>
Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a type of peripheral neuropathy characterized by degeneration of small-diameter sensory fibers, including those responsible for pain. SFN can be idiopathic or associated with conditions such as diabetes, immune-mediated diseases, infections, or toxic substances and may also involve multiple sensory and autonomic symptoms. Diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are the most common causes of SFN. For a significant portion of patients, SFN is idiopathic as no cause can be identified. With no treatments indicated specifically for this type of neuropathic pain and with other pain medications, there is a high unmet medical need for new effective and safe therapies.

<span class=""xn-location"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 16, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that it has submitted applications seeking approval for upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg (maintenance dose) and 45 mg (induction dose)) for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent.

""Many people continue to struggle with symptoms associated with their ulcerative colitis, such as fatigue, bowel urgency, bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Tom Hudson</span>, senior vice president of research and development, chief scientific officer, AbbVie. ""Upadacitinib has the potential to be an important new treatment option for people with ulcerative colitis, who want to address these challenging and disruptive symptoms. We look forward to working with regulatory authorities and hope to bring upadacitinib to people with ulcerative colitis as quickly as possible.""

The applications are supported by data from two Phase 3 induction studies and one maintenance study.<sup>1-3</sup> In these studies, significantly more patients treated with upadacitinib achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo Score) and all secondary endpoints compared to placebo with 45 mg once daily at week 8 for the induction studies, and with 15 mg and 30 mg once daily at 52 weeks for the maintenance study.<sup>1-3</sup>

The safety results of upadacitinib, including the 45 mg dose as induction therapy, in these studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of upadacitinib, with no new important safety risks observed.<sup>1-7</sup>

<b>About Ulcerative Colitis<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, immune-mediated inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the large intestine that causes continuous mucosal inflammation extending, to a variable extent, from the rectum to the more proximal colon.<sup>15,16</sup> The hallmark signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis include rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, tenesmus (a sense of pressure), urgency and fecal incontinence.<sup>15,17 </sup>The disease course of ulcerative colitis varies between patients and can range from quiescent disease to chronic refractory disease, which in some cases can lead to surgery or complications, including cancer or death.<sup>16,19</sup> The severity of symptoms and unpredictability of disease course can lead to substantial burden and often disability among those living with the disease.<sup>18</sup>

Rheumatoid arthritis<br class=""dnr"" />RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.

Psoriatic arthritis<br class=""dnr"" />RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs. RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.

Ankylosing spondylitis<br class=""dnr"" />RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy.

Atopic dermatitis<br class=""dnr"" />RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.

<b>Contraindications</b><br class=""dnr"" />RINVOQ is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients, in patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections, in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and during pregnancy.

<b>Special warnings and precautions for use</b><br class=""dnr"" /><i>Immunosuppressive medicinal products</i><br class=""dnr"" />Use in combination with other potent immunosuppressants is not recommended.

<i>Serious infections</i><br class=""dnr"" />Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving upadacitinib. The most frequent serious infections reported included pneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of bacterial meningitis have been reported. Among opportunistic infections, TB, multidermatomal herpes zoster, oral/esophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis have been reported with upadacitinib. As there is a higher incidence of infections in patients =65 years of age, caution should be used when treating this population.

<i>Viral reactivation</i><br class=""dnr"" />Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes zoster, was reported in clinical studies. The risk of herpes zoster appears to be higher in Japanese patients treated with upadacitinib.

<i>Vaccinations</i><br class=""dnr"" />The use of live, attenuated vaccines during or immediately prior to therapy is not recommended. It is recommended that patients be brought up to date with all immunizations, including prophylactic zoster vaccinations, prior to initiating upadacitinib, in agreement with current immunization guidelines.

<i>Malignancy</i><br class=""dnr"" />The risk of malignancies, including lymphoma is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Malignancies, including nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), have been reported in patients treated with upadacitinib. Consider the risks and benefits of upadacitinib treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated NMSC or when considering continuing upadacitinib therapy in patients who develop a malignancy.

<i>Hematological abnormalities</i><br class=""dnr"" />Treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients with hematological abnormalities observed during routine patient management.

<i>Cardiovascular risk</i><br class=""dnr"" />RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients treated with upadacitinib should have risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.

<i>Lipids</i><br class=""dnr"" />Upadacitinib treatment was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

<i>Hepatic transaminase elevations</i><br class=""dnr"" />Treatment with upadacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo.

<i>Venous thromboembolisms</i><br class=""dnr"" />Events of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, including upadacitinib. Upadacitinib should be used with caution in patients at high risk for DVT/PE.

<b>Adverse reactions</b><br class=""dnr"" />The most commonly reported adverse reactions in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis clinical trials (=2% of patients in at least one of the indications) with upadacitinib 15 mg were upper respiratory tract infections, blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, alanine transaminase increased, bronchitis, nausea, cough, aspartate transaminase increased, and hypercholesterolemia.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions in atopic dermatitis trials (=2% of patients) with upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg were upper respiratory tract infection, acne, herpes simplex, headache, CPK increased, cough, folliculitis, abdominal pain, nausea, neutropenia, pyrexia, and influenza.

Ankylosing spondylitis:<br class=""dnr"" />Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis treated with upadacitinib 15 mg was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients with RA.

Psoriatic arthritis:<br class=""dnr"" />Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with upadacitinib 15 mg was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients with RA. A higher incidence of acne and bronchitis was observed in patients treated with upadacitinib 15 mg (1.3% and 3.9%, respectively) compared to placebo (0.3% and 2.7%, respectively). A higher rate of serious infections (2.6 events per 100 patient-years and 1.3 events per 100 patient-years, respectively) and hepatic transaminase elevations (ALT elevations Grade 3 and higher rates 1.4% and 0.4%, respectively) was observed in patients treated with upadacitinib in combination with MTX therapy compared to patients treated with monotherapy. There was a higher rate of serious infections in patients =65 years of age, although data are limited.

Atopic dermatitis:<br class=""dnr"" />Dose-dependent changes in ALT increased and/or AST increased (= 3 x ULN), lipid parameters, CPK values (&gt; 5 x ULN), and neutropenia <i>(</i>ANC &lt; 1 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L) associated with upadacitinib treatment were similar to what was observed in the rheumatologic disease clinical studies. Based on limited data in atopic dermatitis patients aged 65 years and older, there was a higher rate of overall adverse reactions with the upadacitinib 30 mg dose compared to the 15 mg dose. The safety profile for upadacitinib 15 mg in adolescents was similar to that in adults. The safety and efficacy of the 30 mg dose in adolescents are still being investigated.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","SHANGHAI, China, and REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Sept. 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (“Coherus”, Nasdaq: CHRS) and Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. (“Junshi Biosciences”, HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180) today announced positive interim results from the pivotal study “JUPITER-06” (NCT03829969), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The study met the co-primary endpoints with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients treated with the toripalimab and chemotherapy combination compared to chemotherapy alone.

The results will be summarized by Dr. Feng Wang, Professor at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYUCC), Guangzhou, in a mini-oral session during the ESMO Congress 2021 on Friday, September 17, 2021 at 12:05 pm Eastern Time. The abstract (#1373MO) is now available on the ESMO website.

“The findings of this interim analysis provide strong evidence that the addition of toripalimab to chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic ESCC patients has superior PFS and OS than chemotherapy alone,” said Dr. Wang. “We look forward to updated analyses of overall survival of the JUPITER-06 study in the future and believe that these results will build a strong argument to support the use of toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy as a new standard first-line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic ESCC.”

“A strong and consistent efficacy and safety profile is emerging for toripalimab across multiple tumor types as data read out from pivotal clinical trials in melanoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, urothelial cancer, lung cancer and now also esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,” said Dr. Patricia Keegan, Chief Medical Officer of Junshi Biosciences. “We believe toripalimab could be a potential new treatment choice where patients truly need better options. We will collaborate with Coherus to advance a BLA supplement for ESCC to make toripalimab available as quickly as possible for these patients in the U.S.”

“With JUPITER-06, toripalimab has once again exhibited compelling efficacy in a first-line setting,” said Denny Lanfear, CEO of Coherus. “The significant PFS and similarly robust overall survival data demonstrate that toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy could provide significant clinical benefits to patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We plan to work closely with our partner, Junshi Biosciences, to pursue a BLA supplement for this new indication expeditiously.”

About JUPITER-06
A total of 514 treatment-naive advanced or metastatic patients were randomized (1:1) to receive toripalimab or placebo in combination with paclitaxel plus cisplatin chemotherapy followed by toripalimab or placebo maintenance. The primary endpoints were PFS as assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR) and overall survival (OS).

At a prespecified interim analysis on March 22, 2021, with median follow-up of 7.4 and 7.3 months in the two arms, there was a significant improvement in OS for the toripalimab-chemotherapy arm compared to the placebo-chemotherapy arm (HR=0.58 [95% CI: 0.43-0.78], P=0.00037) with median OS of 17.0 vs. 11.0 months;
One-year OS rates were 66.0% vs.43.7% for the toripalimab-chemotherapy arm compared to the placebo-chemotherapy arm, respectively;
A significant improvement in PFS assessed by BICR was also detected for the toripalimab-chemotherapy arm compared to the placebo-chemotherapy arm (HR=0.58 [95% CI: 0.46-0.74], P<0.00001);
The OS and PFS benefits were observed across key subgroups, including all PD-L1 expression subgroups;
The incidence of Grade =3 adverse events (AEs) (73.2% vs 70.0%) and fatal AEs (8.2% vs 8.2%) were similar between the two arms. No new safety signals were observed.
Junshi Biosciences and Coherus are planning in 2022 to submit a biologics license application supplement to the United States Food and Drug Adminstration for toripalimab for first-line treatment, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, of advanced or metastatic ESCC. In China, the supplemental New Drug Application of this indication has been accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in July, 2021.

About Toripalimab
Toripalimab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody developed for its ability to block PD-1 interactions with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, and for enhanced receptor internalization (endocytosis function). Blocking PD-1 interactions with PD-L1 and PD-L2 is thought to recharge the immune system’s ability to attack and kill tumor cells. More than thirty company-sponsored toripalimab clinical studies covering more than fifteen indications have been conducted globally, including in China and the United States. Ongoing or completed pivotal clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy and safety of toripalimab for a broad range of tumor types including cancers of the lung, nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, breast, liver, kidney and skin.

In China, toripalimab was the first domestic anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for marketing (approved in China as TUOYI®). On December 17, 2018, toripalimab was granted a conditional approval from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the second-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In December 2020, toripalimab was successfully included in the updated National Reimbursement Drug List. In February 2021, the NMPA granted a conditional approval to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after failure of at least two lines of prior systemic therapy. In April, NMPA granted a conditional approval to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who failed platinum-containing chemotherapy or progressed within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy. In addition, two supplemental NDAs for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic NPC or for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced, or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were accepted by the NMPA for review in February and July 2021 respectively.

In the United States, the first toripalimab BLA has been submitted to the FDA for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the 1st line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC and also for toripalimab monotherapy in second or third line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. There are currently no PD-1 blocking antibodies approved for use in NPC in the United States. Additionally, FDA has granted Fast Track designation for toripalimab for the treatment of mucosal melanoma and orphan drug designations for NPC, mucosal melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma. Earlier in 2021 Coherus in-licensed rights to develop and commercialize toripalimab in the United States and Canada. Coherus and Junshi Biosciences plan to file additional toripalimab BLAs with the FDA over the next three years for multiple rare cancers and highly prevalent cancers.

PARIS, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 16, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Coave Therapeutics ('Coave'), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing life-changing gene therapies in rare Ocular and CNS (Central Nervous System) diseases, has entered into an exclusive licensing, co-development and commercialization agreement with Théa, a leading European speciality Pharma focused on ophthalmology. The agreement covers Coave's lead investigational gene therapy candidate CTx-PDE6b (formerly HORA-PDE6b) for patients with PDE6b-associated Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal disease (IRD).

<i>""We are delighted to sign this agreement with Théa for CTx-PDE6b, our most advanced candidate, which represents an innovative new gene therapy for people with Retinitis Pigmentosa,"" </i>said <b><span class=""xn-person"">Rodolphe Clerval</span>, CEO of Coave</b>. <i>""Théa is a leading European speciality pharma company in the field of Ophthalmology with world-class development expertise and commercial capabilities in major markets worldwide. We are very excited about the potential of CTx-PDE6b and look forward to building a successful relationship with Théa, as we advance this novel candidate through clinical development.""</i>

Under the terms of the agreement, Coave will receive an upfront payment and equity investment of €10 million from Théa. Coave is also eligible to receive up to €65 million for achieving specified clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestones with CTx-PDE6b.

Coave and Théa will co-develop CTx-PDE6b under the joint agreement. Coave retains rights to commercialize CTx-PDE6b in the US and Théa receives an exclusive license to commercialize CTx-PDE6b in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> (EU27), <span class=""xn-location"">Ukraine</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Turkey</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Russia</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">North Africa</span>. Coave will be eligible to receive double digit royalties on net sales generated in these territories.

<i>""We are delighted by this alliance between two French companies, a biotech specialized in gene therapy and an ophthalmology-focused specialty pharma. As such, our two companies are very complementary.""</i> said <b>Jean-Frédéric Chibret, </b>President of the Théa Group.<i> ""Théa already owns a broad portfolio of products covering most of the therapeutic classes in ophthalmology. This partnership confirms our will to enter the field of retina, as well as take a position in the new market of gene therapies.""  </i>

CTx-PDE6b is a novel, first-in-class adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy designed to deliver a full-length non-mutated copy of the functional human PDE6b gene into the subretinal space. Dysfunction of the PDE6 protein, and in particular its PDE6ß subunit, ultimately leads to death of rod photoreceptor cells, then cone photoreceptor cells, leading to blindness. There are currently no approved treatments for PDE6b associated RP.

Treatment with CTx-PDE6b may significantly delay or halt retinal degeneration in PDE6ß-deficient patients and delay or prevent the onset of blindness.

CTx-PDE6b is currently in Phase I/II clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of the gene therapy.

Barny Avocats advised Coave Therapeutics on the transaction.

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRTX), a clinical-stage targeted oncology company, today announced results from a cohort of the Phase 1/2 KRYSTAL–1 study evaluating <i>adagrasib</i> at the 600mg BID dose as both monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab in patients with heavily pretreated colorectal cancer harboring a <i>KRAS</i><sup>G12C </sup>mutation. Results showed that <i>adagrasib </i>alone and with cetuximab demonstrated significant clinical activity and broad disease control in these patients. The findings (Abstract # LBA6) will be presented today at 9:47 a.m. ET as a late-breaking oral presentation during the Presidential Symposium II session at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress (ESMO) 2021.

""Patients living with <i>KRAS</i>-mutated colorectal cancer face a significant medical need for new treatment options,"" said Dr. Jared Weiss M.D., lead study investigator and associate professor of medicine, division of oncology at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. ""The positive results presented today show that <i>adagrasib</i> alone or in combination with cetuximab may improve clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer harboring a <i>KRAS</i><sup>G12C </sup>mutation.""

<b>Summary of Clinical Results</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>As of May 25, 2021, 80% of patients enrolled in the<i> adagrasib</i> monotherapy arm (n=46) received at least two prior lines of systemic anticancer therapies, and had a median follow up of 8.9 months. Of the evaluable patients (n=45), results showed an investigator assessed response rate (RR) of 22%, including one unconfirmed partial response (PR), and a disease control rate (DCR) of 87%; the median duration of response (DOR) was 4.2 months. In all enrolled patients, the median progression free survival (PFS) was 5.6 months (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 4.1,8.3).</li>
 	<li>As of July 9, 2021, 90% patients enrolled in the <i>adagrasib</i> plus cetuximab arm (n=32) received at least two prior lines of systemic anticancer therapies, and had a median follow up of 7 months. Of the evaluable patients (n=28), results showed an investigator assessed RR of 43%, including two unconfirmed PRs and a DCR rate of 100%. After the data cutoff date, of the two unconfirmed PRs, follow up scans showed one patient had a confirmed PR, and the second patient progressed. At the time of the analysis, 63% (20/32) of enrolled patients remained on treatment.</li>
 	<li><i>Adagrasib</i> monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab was well-tolerated in this study, with a manageable safety profile. Grade 3/4 treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were observed in 30% of patients treated with<i> adagrasib</i> alone, and in 16% of patients treated with the combination. Treatment related adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients who received combination therapy and in none (0%) of those who received <i>adagrasib</i> monotherapy. No Grade 5 TRAEs were observed in either treatment arm.</li>
</ul>
""<i>Adagrasib </i>represents Mirati's scientific commitment to the discovery and development of novel targets that may lead to new treatment options for people with cancer,"" said <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3295444-1&amp;h=639398859&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirati.com%2Fabout%2Fexecutive-leadership%2F%23charles-bauM&A=Charles+M.+Baum%2C+M.D.%2C+Ph.D."" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Charles M.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <b>REGN</b>) and Sanofi announced positive Phase 3 results for a Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab) combination treatment were presented today during a late-breaking session at the European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual Congress 2021. The trial, which met its primary overall survival (OS) endpoint and all key secondary endpoints, assessed the investigational use of PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in combination with a physician's choice of platinum-doublet chemotherapy (Libtayo combination) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) irrespective of histology and across all PD-L1 expression levels, compared to chemotherapy alone. These results were also achieved in a patient population with varied baseline characteristics and will form the basis of regulatory submissions, including in the U.S. and European Union (EU).

""Libtayo added to chemotherapy significantly improved patient outcomes, extending median overall survival to 22 months and median progression-free survival to 8 months,"" said Miranda Gogishvili, M.D., an oncologist at the High Technology Medical Center University Clinic, in <span class=""xn-location"">Tbilisi, Georgia</span> and a trial investigator. ""Exploratory analyses showed that survival improvements were seen across squamous and non-squamous histologies and in patients with reduced daily functioning, with 43% of patients having squamous disease and 84% having an ECOG 1 performance status. Furthermore, in another exploratory analysis, the Libtayo combination helped delay deterioration in patient-reported quality of life and pain symptoms.""

In the overall population, patients treated with the Libtayo combination (n=312) experienced significant improvements compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone (n=154), including a:
<ul>
 	<li><b>22-month median OS </b>compared to 13 months for chemotherapy, representing <b>a 29% relative reduction in the risk of death</b> (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53 to 0.93; p=0.014). The 12-month probability of survival was 66% for the Libtayo combination and 56% for chemotherapy.</li>
 	<li><b>8-month median progression-free survival (PFS) </b>compared to 5 months for chemotherapy, representing <b>a 46% relative reduction in the risk of disease progression</b> (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.70; p&lt;0.0001). The 12-month probability of PFS was 38% for the Libtayo combination and 16% for chemotherapy.</li>
 	<li><b>43% objective response rate (ORR)</b><b> </b>compared to 23% for chemotherapy.</li>
 	<li><b>16-month median duration of response (DOR)</b> compared to 7 months for chemotherapy.</li>
</ul>
Favorable patient-reported outcomes were also observed. Specifically, the Libtayo combination delayed deterioration in pain symptoms (HR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.60; nominal p&lt;0.0001) and showed a trend towards delayed deterioration in global health status/quality of life (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.51 to 1.19; nominal p=0.248), compared to chemotherapy. The Libtayo combination also improved pain symptoms, compared to chemotherapy (-4.98 difference in baseline changes between treatment groups; 95% CI: -8.36 to -1.60; nominal p=0.004).

No new Libtayo safety signals were identified. The median duration of exposure was 38 weeks for the Libtayo combination (n=312) and 21 weeks for chemotherapy (n=153). Adverse events (AEs) of any grade occurred in 96% of patients receiving the Libtayo combination and 94% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone, with 19% and 0% being immune-mediated, respectively. For the Libtayo combination and chemotherapy groups, the most common AEs were anemia (44%, 40%), alopecia (37%, 43%) and nausea (25%, 16%); grade =3 AEs occurring in =5% of patients were anemia (10%, 7%) and neutropenia (both 6%). Treatment discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 5% of patients receiving the Libtayo combination and 3% receiving chemotherapy.

""This Phase 3 trial was stopped early because Libtayo significantly improved overall survival compared to chemotherapy, a milestone also achieved by our Phase 3 trial for Libtayo monotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with high PD-L1 expression,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Israel Lowy</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron. ""Both trials were designed to reflect everyday clinical practice by allowing for the enrollment of patients with difficult-to-treat disease characteristics. And this is the second Libtayo trial to demonstrate significant improvement in its primary and key secondary endpoints for these patient populations, compared to chemotherapy.""

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020, an estimated 2.2 million and 225,000 new cases were diagnosed globally and in the U.S., respectively. Approximately 84% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, with 75% of these cases diagnosed in advanced stages. While PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy has primarily advanced the treatment of NSCLC with =50% PD-L1 expression, approximately 70% of all NSCLC cases will have &lt;50% PD-L1 expression, making it the most common treatment setting.

""These data add to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of Libtayo in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Peter C. Adamson</span>, M.D., Global Development Head, Oncology and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi. ""With additional trials underway investigating Libtayo as the backbone in combinations with conventional and novel therapeutic approaches, we are encouraged by the potential to further improve outcomes for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers.""

The use of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

<b>About the Phase 3 Trial<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The randomized, multicenter Phase 3 trial, called EMPOWER-Lung 3, investigated a first-line combination treatment of Libtayo and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone. The trial enrolled 466 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as well as squamous or non-squamous histologies across all PD-L1 expression levels and with no ALK, EGFR and ROS1 aberrations.

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either Libtayo 350 mg (n=312) or placebo (n=154) administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 108 weeks, plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. The primary endpoint was OS, and key secondary endpoints were PFS and ORR. The probability of survival and PFS at 12 months were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier estimates.

Notably, patients in the trial had a variety of baseline characteristics commonly considered difficult-to-treat. Among those enrolled, 43% had tumors with squamous histology, 67% had tumors with &lt;50% PD-L1 expression, 15% had inoperable locally advanced disease not eligible for definitive chemoradiation, and 7% had pretreated and clinically stable brain metastases. Additionally, 84% of patients had an ECOG 1 performance status. ECOG performance status assesses patient ability to conduct daily living activities and prognosis on a scale of increasing severity ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (death).

<b>About Libtayo<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Libtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the PD-1 immune checkpoint receptor on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.

The generic name for Libtayo in its approved U.S. indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. FDA. Libtayo is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.

The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in advanced cervical cancer, as well as in trials combining Libtayo with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

<b>About Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune<sup>®</sup></i> Technology<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune</i> technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span> was a graduate student with his mentor <span class=""xn-person"">Frederick W. Alt</span> in 1985, they were the first to <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3295452-1&amp;h=2937039095&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2F0168952585900897&amp;a=envision"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">envision</a> making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing <i>VelocImmune </i>and related <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup></i> technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used <i>VelocImmune</i> technology to create approximately a quarter of all original, FDA-approved and authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN–COV™ (casirivimab with imdevimab), Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab), Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab), Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), Evkeeza<sup>®</sup> (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS</b>

<b>What is Libtayo?<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery (locally advanced BCC) and have received treatment with a hedgehog inhibitor (HHI), or cannot receive treatment with an HHI.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma that has spread (metastatic BCC) and have received treatment with an HHI, or cannot receive treatment with an HHI. This use is approved based on how many patients responded to treatment and how long they responded. Studies are ongoing to provide additional information about clinical benefit.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Libtayo may be used as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, or your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), and your tumor tests positive for high ""PD-L1"" and your tumor does not have an abnormal ""EGFR"","" ALK ""or ""ROS1"" gene.

It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.

<b>What is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Libtayo is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system. Libtayo can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can sometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. You can have more than one of these problems at the same time. These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended.

<b>Call or see your healthcare provider right away if you develop any new or worsening signs or symptoms, including:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Lung problems:</b> cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain</li>
 	<li><b>Intestinal problems:</b> diarrhea (loose stools) or more frequent bowel movements than usual, stools that are black, tarry, sticky or have blood or mucus, or severe stomach area (abdomen) pain or tenderness</li>
 	<li><b>Liver problems:</b> yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, severe nausea or vomiting, pain on the right side of your stomach area (abdomen), dark urine (tea colored), or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal</li>

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the presentation of the full results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-826 trial investigating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2021 (Abstract #LBA2). These data were also simultaneously published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. This is the first combination regimen with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to improve overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab as a first-line treatment of persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.

KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy (paclitaxel plus cisplatin or paclitaxel plus carboplatin) with or without bevacizumab (KEYTRUDA plus chemo ± bev) reduced the risk of death by one-third, or 33% (HR=0.67 [95% CI, 0.54-0.84]; p&lt;0.001), versus chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (chemo ± bev). Median OS for KEYTRUDA plus chemo ± bev was 24.4 months (95% CI, 19.2-not reached [NR]) compared to 16.5 months (95% CI, 14.5-19.4) for chemo ± bev. For the dual primary endpoint of PFS, median PFS (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.53-0.79]; p&lt;0.001) was 10.4 months (95% CI, 9.1-12.1) in those treated with KEYTRUDA plus chemo ± bev and 8.2 months (95% CI, 6.4-8.4) among those treated with chemo ± bev. In the trial, KEYTRUDA plus chemo ± bev showed an ORR of 65.9% (95% CI, 60.3-71.2), and chemo ± bev showed an ORR of 50.8% (95% CI, 45.1-56.5). Median duration of response (DOR) was 18.0 months (range, 1.3+ to 24.2+) in the KEYTRUDA plus chemo ± bev arm and 10.4 months (range, 1.5+ to 22.0+) in the chemo ± bev arm. The results were consistent with or without bevacizumab use.

“Cervical cancer continues to be the second leading cause of cancer-related death in young women between 15 and 44 years of age, and historically women have faced a poor prognosis when diagnosed at later stages,” said Dr. Nicoletta Colombo, associate professor, University of Milan-Bicocca, and director, European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy. “These important survival results support KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab as a potential new treatment option in the first-line setting for patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.”

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) Grade =3 occurred in 68.4% of patients in the KEYTRUDA plus chemo ± bev arm and 64.1% of patients in the chemo ± bev arm. Patients in the KEYTRUDA plus chemo ± bev arm had a longer duration of treatment than those in the chemo ± bev arm. In the KEYTRUDA plus chemo ± bev arm, TRAEs led to discontinuation of any treatment in 31.3% of patients and of all treatment in 3.3% of patients. In the chemo ± bev arm, TRAEs led to discontinuation of any treatment in 22.3% of patients and of all treatment in 1.9% of patients.

“KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, is the first anti-PD-1/PD-L1-based regimen to demonstrate statistically significant improvement in overall survival for the first-line treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “These results highlight the critical role KEYTRUDA can play in improving outcomes for certain women with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. We continue to prioritize research into how we can extend the lives of patients facing deadly cancers, such as cervical cancer, through innovative combination approaches.”

Merck is dedicated to advancing research in women’s cancers. The company is rapidly advancing an extensive clinical development program for KEYTRUDA and several other investigational and approved medicines across gynecologic cancers, including evaluating KEYTRUDA for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer.

The primary endpoints are OS and PFS. The secondary endpoints include ORR, DOR and safety.

The study enrolled 617 patients. The study population characteristics were: median age of 51 years (range, 22 to 82), 16% age 65 or older; 58% white and 42% all other races; 56% and 43% ECOG PS of 0 or 1, respectively; 89% with PD-L1 (CPS =1); 63% received bevacizumab as study treatment; 23% with adenocarcinoma and 5% with adenosquamous histology; for patients with persistent or recurrent disease with or without distant metastases, 39% had received prior chemoradiation only, and 17% had received prior chemoradiation plus surgery.

Patients in the KEYTRUDA arm received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks (Q3W) for up to 35 cycles plus investigator’s choice of paclitaxel plus cisplatin or paclitaxel plus carboplatin Q3W for up to six cycles with or without bevacizumab Q3W. Patients in the placebo arm received placebo plus investigator’s choice of paclitaxel plus cisplatin or paclitaxel plus carboplatin Q3W for up to six cycles with or without bevacizumab Q3W.

Immune-mediated adverse events and infusion reactions of any grade occurred in 33.9% of patients in the KEYTRUDA plus chemo ± bev arm and 15.2% of patients in the chemo ± bev arm. Treatment-related deaths occurred in two patients in the KEYTRUDA plus chemo ± bev arm (encephalitis autoimmune [also immune-mediated] and intestinal perforation [n=1 each]), and four patients in the chemo ± bev arm (embolism, female genital tract fistula, large intestine perforation and pulmonary sepsis [n=1 each]).

<b>About Cervical Cancer</b>

Cervical cancer forms in the cells lining the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus. While screenings and prevention have resulted in declining cervical cancer rates, the disease continues to affect many people in the U.S. and around the world. Cervical cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in women globally. Worldwide, it is estimated there were more than 604,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and nearly 342,000 deaths resulting from the disease in 2020. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be nearly 14,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,300 deaths resulting from the disease in 2021. For patients in the U.S. who are diagnosed with cervical cancer that has spread to nearby organs or distant parts of the body, the five-year survival rate is estimated to be 17%.

<b>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</b>

KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.

<span class=""bwuline"">Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</span>

<i>KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.

<i>KEYTRUDA with Axitinib</i>

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT =3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT =3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT =3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</span>

<i>Adrenal Insufficiency</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated.

Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality.

ALAMEDA, Calif.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.exelixis.com%2F&amp;esheet=52493543&amp;newsitemid=20210917005517&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Exelixis%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=d4bc42b35d3ecb08cd17986c54b6d4fb"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Exelixis, Inc.</a> (Nasdaq: EXEL) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved CABOMETYX<sup>®</sup> (cabozantinib) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that has progressed following prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority Review to CABOMETYX and its approval comes more than two months ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of December 4, 2021. DTC is the most common type of thyroid cancer in the U.S., and patients who are resistant to radioactive iodine treatment face a poor prognosis.<sup>1,2,3,4</sup>

“Before today, patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who have progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy were facing aggressive disease and no standard treatment option,” said Marcia S. Brose, M.D., Ph.D., Chief, Cancer Center Operation Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Jefferson Torresdale Hospital, Co-Director, Community Based Clinical Trials, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University, and principal investigator of COSMIC-311. “In the COSMIC-311 pivotal phase 3 trial, CABOMETYX extended the time patients live without progression of their cancer. The FDA approval of CABOMETYX is an important advancement for these patients who are badly in need of new treatment options.”

The approval is based on results from COSMIC-311, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating CABOMETYX versus placebo in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory DTC who progressed after up to two prior VEGFR-targeted therapies. At a planned interim analysis, CABOMETYX significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death versus placebo (p&lt;0.0001) in the intent-to-treat population. At a follow-up analysis with a median follow-up of 10.1 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent radiology committee was 11.0 months for patients treated with CABOMETYX (n=170) compared with 1.9 months for patients treated with placebo (n=88); hazard ratio (HR): 0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.15–0.31. These results will be presented at the 2021 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress this month.

“This approval of CABOMETYX builds on our existing legacy of delivering transformational medicines for patients with difficult-to-treat forms of cancer,” said Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, Exelixis. “We would like to thank the clinical trial participants, the physicians and their staff who participated in the COSMIC-311 trial and to acknowledge the team at the FDA for their collaboration during the quick review of our application.”

The most common adverse events (AEs) reported in at least 25% of patients treated with CABOMETYX were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, fatigue, hypertension and stomatitis. Grade 3/4 AEs that occurred in at least 5% of patients were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea and stomatitis. Serious AEs occurred in 34% of patients who received CABOMETYX, and the most common serious AEs reported in at least 2% of patients included diarrhea, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism and dyspnea. Fatal AEs occurred in 1.6% of patients treated with CABOMETYX arm, including arterial hemorrhage (0.8%) and pulmonary embolism (0.8%). Dose reductions were required in 56% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, and 22% of patients required a second dose reduction. AEs leading to discontinuation of CABOMETYX occurred in 5% of patients.

“Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who have progressed following prior therapy and are radioactive iodine-refractory often face a poor prognosis and have limited treatment options,” said Gary Bloom, Executive Director of ThyCa: Thyroid Cancer Survivors’ Association. “We are excited about the latest approval of CABOMETYX, which will offer hope for patients with this type of thyroid cancer.”

<b>About COSMIC-311</b>

COSMIC-311 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 pivotal trial that enrolled 258 patients at 164 sites globally. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either CABOMETYX 60 mg or placebo once daily. The primary endpoints were PFS and objective response rate. Exelixis is sponsoring COSMIC-311, and Ipsen is co-funding the trial.

<b>About DTC</b>

Approximately 44,000 new cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2021.<sup>5</sup> Nearly three out of four of these cases will be in women, and the disease is more commonly diagnosed at a younger age compared to most other adult cancers.<sup>1</sup> While cancerous thyroid tumors include differentiated, medullary and anaplastic forms, differentiated thyroid tumors make up about 90% of cases.<sup>1</sup> These include papillary, follicular and Hürthle cell cancer.<sup>1</sup> DTC is typically treated with surgery followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue with radioiodine, but approximately 5% to 15% of cases are resistant to radioiodine treatment.<sup>1,6</sup> For these patients, life expectancy is only three to five years from the time metastatic lesions are detected.<sup>2,3,4</sup>

<b>About CABOMETYX</b><sup>®</sup><b> (cabozantinib)</b>

In the U.S., CABOMETYX tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC; for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have been previously treated with sorafenib; for patients with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab; and for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in the European Union and additional countries and regions worldwide. In 2016, Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the U.S. and Japan. In 2017, Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize cabozantinib in the U.S.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>Hemorrhage: </b>Severe and fatal hemorrhages occurred with CABOMETYX. The incidence of Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhagic events was 5% in CABOMETYX patients in RCC, HCC, and DTC studies. Discontinue CABOMETYX for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage and prior to surgery as recommended. Do not administer CABOMETYX to patients who have a recent history of hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, hematemesis, or melena.

<b>Perforations and Fistulas: </b>Fistulas, including fatal cases, occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, including fatal cases, occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of fistulas and perforations, including abscess and sepsis. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who experience a Grade 4 fistula or a GI perforation.<b></b>

<b>Thrombotic Events: </b>CABOMETYX increased the risk of thrombotic events. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 7% (including 4% pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism in 2% of CABOMETYX patients. Fatal thrombotic events occurred in CABOMETYX patients. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or serious arterial or venous thromboembolic events that require medical intervention.<b></b>

<b>Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis: </b>CABOMETYX can cause hypertension, including hypertensive crisis. Hypertension was reported in 37% (16% Grade 3 and &lt;1% Grade 4) of CABOMETYX patients. Do not initiate CABOMETYX in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Monitor blood pressure regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. Withhold CABOMETYX for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with medical management; when controlled, resume at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue CABOMETYX for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy or for hypertensive crisis.<b></b>

<b>Diarrhea: </b>Diarrhea occurred in 62% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 10% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor and manage patients using antidiarrheals as indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to = Grade 1, resume at a reduced dose.<b></b>

<b>Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE): </b>PPE occurred in 45% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 PPE occurred in 13% of CABOMETYX patients. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to Grade 1 and resume at a reduced dose for intolerable Grade 2 PPE or Grade 3 PPE.<b></b>

<b>Hepatotoxicity: </b>CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to CABOMETYX alone.

Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes than when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt CABOMETYX and nivolumab and consider administering corticosteroids.

With the combination of CABOMETYX and nivolumab, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients. ALT or AST &gt;3 times ULN (Grade =2) was reported in 83 patients, of whom 23 (28%) received systemic corticosteroids; ALT or AST resolved to Grades 0-1 in 74 (89%). Among the 44 patients with Grade =2 increased ALT or AST who were rechallenged with either CABOMETYX (n=9) or nivolumab (n=11) as a single agent or with both (n=24), recurrence of Grade =2 increased ALT or AST was observed in 2 patients receiving CABOMETYX, 2 patients receiving nivolumab, and 7 patients receiving both CABOMETYX and nivolumab. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose based on severity.

<b>Adrenal Insufficiency: </b>CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX and/or nivolumab and resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose depending on severity.

Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 4.7% (15/320) of patients with RCC who received CABOMETYX with nivolumab, including Grade 3 (2.2%), and Grade 2 (1.9%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 0.9% and withholding of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 2.8% of patients with RCC.

Approximately 80% (12/15) of patients with adrenal insufficiency received hormone replacement therapy, including systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 27% (n=4) of the 15 patients. Of the 9 patients in whom CABOMETYX with nivolumab was withheld for adrenal insufficiency, 6 reinstated treatment after symptom improvement; of these, all (n=6) received hormone replacement therapy and 2 had recurrence of adrenal insufficiency.

<b>Proteinuria: </b>Proteinuria was observed in 8% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor urine protein regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. For Grade 2 or 3 proteinuria, withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to = Grade 1 proteinuria, resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.

<b>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ): </b>ONJ occurred in &lt;1% of CABOMETYX patients. ONJ can manifest as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration or erosion, persistent jaw pain, or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery. Perform an oral examination prior to CABOMETYX initiation and periodically during treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. Withhold CABOMETYX for development of ONJ until complete resolution, resume at a reduced dose.<b></b>

<b>Impaired Wound Healing:</b> Wound complications occurred with CABOMETYX. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer CABOMETYX for at least 2 weeks after major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of CABOMETYX after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.

<b>Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS):</b> RPLS, a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic findings on MRI, can occur with CABOMETYX. Evaluate for RPLS in patients presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion, or altered mental function. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop RPLS.

<b>Thyroid Dysfunction:</b> Thyroid dysfunction, primarily hypothyroidism, has been observed with CABOMETYX. Based on the safety population, thyroid dysfunction occurred in 19% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 0.4% of patients.

Patients should be assessed for signs of thyroid dysfunction prior to the initiation of CABOMETYX and monitored for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction during CABOMETYX treatment. Thyroid function testing and management of dysfunction should be performed as clinically indicated.

<b>Hypocalcemia:</b> CABOMETYX can cause hypocalcemia. Based on the safety population, hypocalcemia occurred in 13% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 2% and Grade 4 in 1% of patients. Laboratory abnormality data were not collected in CABOSUN.

In COSMIC-311, hypocalcemia occurred in 36% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 6% and Grade 4 in 3% of patients.

Monitor blood calcium levels and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue CABOMETYX depending on severity.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: </b>CABOMETYX can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CABOMETYX and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.<b></b>

WILMINGTON, Del.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Updated results from the CASPIAN Phase III trial showed AstraZeneca’s IMFINZI<sup>®</sup> (durvalumab) in combination with a choice of chemotherapies, etoposide plus either carboplatin or cisplatin, demonstrated a sustained, clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) benefit at three years for adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) treated in the 1st-line setting.

These data, which show the longest survival update ever reported for an immunotherapy treatment in this setting, were presented during a mini-oral session on September 18, 2021, at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2021.

The CASPIAN trial met the primary endpoint of OS in <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrazeneca-us.com%2Fmedia%2Fpress-releases%2F2019%2Fimfinzi-durvalumab-improves-overall-survival-at-interim-analysis-in-the-phase-iii-caspian-trial-in-1st-line-extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-06272019.html&amp;esheet=52493882&amp;newsitemid=20210918005025&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=June+2019&amp;index=1&amp;md5=64274126af95309b8640423f040dfae8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">June 2019</a>, reducing the risk of death by 27% (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.91; p=0.0047), which has formed the basis of regulatory approvals in many countries around the world. Updated results were previously presented during the ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program in <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrazeneca-us.com%2Fmedia%2Fpress-releases%2F2020%2Fimfinzi-durvalumab-showed-a-sustained-overall-survival-benefit-in-1st-line-extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-in-the-phase-iii-caspian-trial-05292020.html&amp;esheet=52493882&amp;newsitemid=20210918005025&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=May+2020&amp;index=2&amp;md5=c6c813be44d582a47c386ca4092454e5"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">May 2020</a> with a median follow up of more than two years.

The latest results for IMFINZI<i> </i>plus chemotherapy showed sustained efficacy after a median follow up of more than three years for censored patients, with a 29% reduction in the risk of death versus chemotherapy alone (based on an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.60-0.86; nominal p=0.0003). Updated median OS was 12.9 months versus 10.5 for chemotherapy.

The results included a planned exploratory analysis, where an estimated 17.6% of patients treated with IMFINZI plus chemotherapy were alive at three years, versus 5.8% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The survival benefits were consistent across all subgroups, in line with previous analyses.

Luis Paz-Ares, MD, PhD, Chair, Medical Oncology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain and principal investigator in the CASPIAN Phase III trial said: “Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer historically have had limited treatment options and still face a dire prognosis, which makes these data showing that three times as many patients survive three years following IMFINZI treatment especially meaningful. These results reinforce IMFINZI plus platinum chemotherapy as an important standard of care in this setting.”

Susan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “This remarkable improvement in survival is an unprecedented achievement at three years for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. We are deeply committed to helping improve survival rates in this disease with research into new treatment options to transform outcomes at various stages, not only with the CASPIAN trial, but also with the ADRIATIC trial in limited-stage disease.”

IMFINZI plus chemotherapy continued to demonstrate a well-tolerated safety profile consistent with the known profiles of these medicines. Results showed 32.5% of patients experienced a serious adverse event (all causality) with IMFINZI plus chemotherapy versus 36.5% with chemotherapy alone.

IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is approved in the 1st-line setting of ES-SCLC in more than 55 countries, including the US, Japan, China and across the EU.

IMFINZI is also being tested following concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in patients with limited-stage SCLC in the ADRIATIC Phase III trial as part of a broad development program. In addition, IMFINZI is also approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III disease after CRT in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on results from the PACIFIC Phase III trial.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

There are no contraindications for IMFINZI<sup>®</sup> (durvalumab).

<b>Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue IMFINZI depending on severity. See Dosing and Administration for specific details. In general, if IMFINZI requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 mg to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span></b>

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients who did not receive recent prior radiation, the incidence of immune-mediated pneumonitis was 2.4% (34/1414), including fatal (&lt;0.1%), and Grade 3-4 (0.4%) adverse reactions. In patients who received recent prior radiation, the incidence of pneumonitis (including radiation pneumonitis) in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC following definitive chemoradiation within 42 days prior to initiation of IMFINZI in PACIFIC was 18.3% (87/475) in patients receiving IMFINZI and 12.8% (30/234) in patients receiving placebo. Of the patients who received IMFINZI (475), 1.1% were fatal and 2.7% were Grade 3 adverse reactions. The frequency and severity of immune-mediated pneumonitis in patients who did not receive definitive chemoradiation prior to IMFINZI were similar in patients who received IMFINZI as a single agent or with ES-SCLC when in combination with chemotherapy.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span></b>

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated colitis that is frequently associated with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2% (37/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%) and Grade 3 (0.4%) adverse reactions.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</span></b>

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 2.8% (52/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%) and Grade 3 (1.4%) adverse reactions.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</span></b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b><i>Adrenal Insufficiency</i></b>:<b> </b>IMFINZI can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

</ul>
<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

IMFINZI can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt, slow the rate of, or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity. See Dosing and Administration for specific details. For Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions, consider using pre-medications with subsequent doses. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (42/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (0.3%) adverse reactions.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after IMFINZI</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/L-1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/L-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/L-1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMFINZI and for at least 3 months after the last dose of IMFINZI.

<b>Lactation</b>

There is no information regarding the presence of IMFINZI in human milk; however, because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants from IMFINZI, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.

<b>Notes to Editors</b>

<b>About small cell lung cancer</b>

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one-quarter of all cancer deaths in the United States: more than breast, prostate and colorectal cancers combined.<sup>1</sup> Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and SCLC, with about 15% classified as SCLC.<sup>2</sup>

SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly despite initial response to chemotherapy.<sup>3,4</sup> About two-thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.<sup>5 </sup>Prognosis is particularly poor, as prior to the approval of immunotherapy regimens for ES-SCLC, only 7% of all patients with SCLC and only 3% of patients with extensive-stage disease will be alive five years after diagnosis.<sup>5</sup>

<b>About CASPIAN</b>

CASPIAN was a randomized, open-label, multi-center, global Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of 805 patients with ES-SCLC. The trial compared IMFINZI<i> </i>in combination with chemotherapy (etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin), or IMFINZI and chemotherapy with the addition of a second immunotherapy, tremelimumab, versus chemotherapy alone. In the two experimental arms, patients were treated with four cycles of chemotherapy. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation.

The trial was conducted in more than 200 centers across 23 countries, including the US, Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint was OS in each of the two experimental arms. In June 2019, AstraZeneca announced the CASPIAN Phase III trial had met one primary endpoint of demonstrating OS for IMFINZI plus chemotherapy at a planned interim analysis. In March 2020, however, it was announced that the second experimental arm with tremelimumab did not meet its primary endpoint of OS.

<b>About IMFINZI<sup>® </sup>(durvalumab)</b>

IMFINZI is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumor’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

In addition to approvals in ES-SCLC and unresectable, Stage III NSCLC, IMFINZI is approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in several countries. Since the first approval in May 2017, more than 100,000 patients have been treated with IMFINZI.

As part of a broad development program, IMFINZI is being tested as a single treatment and in combinations with other anti-cancer treatments for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, biliary tract cancer (a form of liver cancer), esophageal cancer, gastric and gastroesophageal cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and other solid tumors.

<b>About AstraZeneca Support Programs</b>

AstraZeneca strives to ensure that appropriate patients and their oncologists have access to IMFINZI and relevant support resources. These include educational resources, an Oncology Nurse Educator program and affordability and reimbursement programs, such as Access 360™.

Additionally, AstraZeneca has launched Lighthouse, a program that provides support to patients during any immune-mediated adverse events they may encounter during treatment, through medically trained Lighthouse Advocates. The program aims to make patients’ treatment experience as comfortable as possible. Find out more about Lighthouse at LighthouseProgram.com or call 1-855-LHOUSE1(1-855-546-8731).

<p align=""justify"">INCHEON, Korea and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 20, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BYOOVIZ™ (ranibizumab-nuna), a biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS<sup>®</sup> (ranibizumab)<sup>i</sup>, for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV).</p>
<p align=""justify"">Ranibizumab is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy that prevents vision loss in patients with retinal vascular disorders which can cause irreversible blindness or visual impairments in adults in the United States (US).<sup>ii</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>iii</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>iv</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>v</sup></p>
<p align=""justify"">BYOOVIZ™ is the first ophthalmology biosimilar approved in the United States. Biosimilars are products that have been demonstrated to be similar in efficacy and safety to the originator’s reference product, with the advantage that they offer cost savings and promote sustainable access to therapies.<sup>vi</sup> Savings in the United States over the next five years from 2020 to 2024 as a result of biosimilars are projected to exceed $100 billion.<sup>vii</sup></p>
<p align=""justify"">""In the United States, approximately 11 million people are affected with AMD and the prevalence of advanced AMD is growing due to the aging population. The approval of the first ranibizumab biosimilar in the US is a monumental milestone for people living with retinal vascular disorders in the US,"" said Kyung-Ah Kim, Senior Vice President and Development Division Leader, at Samsung Bioepis. “The approval of BYOOVIZ underscores our continued commitment to providing valuable treatment options for people who do not have access to life-enhancing biologic medicines around the world,” she added.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are very excited to be able to open a new chapter with the approval of BYOOVIZ in the US. This approval represents a great step toward the advancement of a new therapeutic option addressing debilitating disease progression of patients with retinal vascular disorders in the US,” said Ian Henshaw, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Biosimilars at Biogen. “Biosimilars could help broaden patient access to more affordable treatments and generate healthcare savings to offset rising costs of these complex diseases while ensuring sustainability of healthcare systems.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">In addition to the US approval, BYOOVIZ™ was approved in Europe, including 27 European Union (EU) member countries on August 18, 2021 and the United Kingdom on August 31, 2021.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Samsung Bioepis and Biogen entered into a commercialization agreement for two ophthalmology biosimilar candidates, SB11, a biosimilar candidate referencing LUCENTIS<sup>®</sup> (ranibizumab) and SB15, a biosimilar candidate referencing EYLEA<sup>®</sup><sup>viii</sup> (aflibercept), in November 2019. Developed by Samsung Bioepis, SB11 will be commercialized under the brand name BYOOVIZ™ by Biogen in the United States. Pursuant to a global license agreement entered into with Genentech, Samsung Bioepis and Biogen will have freedom to market SB11 in the United States as of June 2022, i.e., before expiration of Genentech’s applicable SPCs, and elsewhere in other territories after expiration of Genentech’s SPCs.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The FDA approval of BYOOVIZ™ was based on a totality of evidence including analytical, non-clinical data, and clinical data. In a randomized, double-masked, parallel group, multicenter Phase 3 study of SB11, the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of SB11 was compared to reference ranibizumab in patients with wet AMD. 705 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive SB11 or reference ranibizumab in monthly injections (0.5 mg), and 634 patients continued to receive treatment up to week 48. The Least Squares (LS) mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at week 52 was 9.79 letters for SB11, compared with 10.41 letters for reference ranibizumab (difference: -0.62, [90% CI: -2.092, 0.857]). The LS mean change in central subfield thickness (CST) was -139.55 µm for SB11 vs -124.46 µm for reference ranibizumab (difference: -15.09, [95% CI, -25.617, -4.563]). PK, safety including incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, and the immunogenicity profile of SB11 and reference ranibizumab were comparable at all timepoints up to week 52.</p>
<p align=""justify"">BYOOVIZ™ (ranibizumab-nuna) is Samsung Bioepis’ fifth biosimilar approved in the US, following the approval of RENFLEXIS<sup>®</sup> (infliximab-abda) in April 2017, ONTRUZANT<sup>®</sup> (trastuzumab-dttb) in January 2019, ETICOVO<sup>®</sup> (etanercept-ykro) in April 2019, and HADLIMA™ (adalimumab-bwwd) in July 2019.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Please see full indications and important safety information for BYOOVIZ™ below.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><u>About BYOOVIZ™ (ranibizumab-nuna)</u></strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">BYOOVIZ™ is approved in the US for the following indications:</p>
<p align=""justify"">Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)</p>
<p align=""justify"">Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)</p>
<p align=""justify"">Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV)</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><u>Select Important Safety Information</u></strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><u>WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS</u></strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients should be monitored following the injection.</strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been noted both pre- and post-intravitreal injection.</strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors.</strong></p>

<p align=""justify""><strong>About neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD)</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in adults over 50 years old. Approximately 11 million individuals are affected with AMD in the US alone. Wet AMD is responsible for 80 to 90 % of all AMD-related blindness.<sup>ii</sup><sup>i</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>ix</sup></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO)</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Central retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common cause of retinal disease that can cause vision loss. Vision loss from CRVO is commonly caused by macular edema, which occurs when fluid leaks into the macula (center of the retina) as a result of blocked blood vessel.<sup>x</sup></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV)</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Myopia is one of the most common causes of vision impairment, and one of the most feared complications of myopia is the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Myopic CNV can occur in patients with any degree of myopia, even in the absence of characteristic degenerative retinal changes.<sup>v</sup></p>

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 20, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the company's Portico™ with FlexNav™ transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) system to treat people with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme risk for open-heart surgery. With this latest TAVR (also referred to as TAVI, or transcatheter aortic valve implantation) advancement, Abbott continues to offer the industry's leading portfolio of structural heart solutions that include innovative, minimally invasive therapies to repair or replace diseased or damaged heart valves or close openings in the heart.

Aortic stenosis is one of the most common and life-threatening heart valve diseases. It occurs when the aortic valve's opening narrows and restricts blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta.<sup>1</sup> Patients with the disease can experience breathlessness, chest pressure or tightness, fainting, palpitations, fatigue, and heart murmurs. The condition can ultimately lead to heart failure.<sup>2</sup> While many people don't have noticeable symptoms, more than one in eight aged 75 and older has moderate or severe aortic stenosis, which reduces the heart's pumping ability.<sup>3</sup> Prior to TAVR, the standard of care for severe aortic stenosis was surgical aortic valve replacement, but not all patients were candidates for open-heart surgery.

""For people in the U.S. suffering from aortic stenosis and unable to have surgery, the Portico with FlexNav system offers a safe and effective treatment option,"" said Raj Makkar, M.D., associate director of Interventional Technologies at Cedars-Sinai's Smidt Heart Institute, who served as co-principal investigator for the study that led to FDA approval. <span class=""xn-person"">Gregory Fontana</span>, M.D., national director, Cardiothoracic Surgery at Hospital Corporation of America and American Research Institute, also served as co-principal investigator of the Portico IDE study.

With years of experience globally, Portico is a self-expanding TAVR valve with intra-annular (within the native valve) leaflets that help provide optimal blood flow (hemodynamics) when placed inside a patient's natural valve. The structure of the replacement valve also preserves access to the critical coronary arteries for future coronary interventions. The Portico device is implanted using Abbott's FlexNav delivery system, which features a slim design to accommodate different patient anatomies and small vessels, and optimizes flexibility, ease of tracking and precision of valve placement.

""With the approval of our TAVR therapy in the U.S., physicians now have access to an even more robust set of solutions to treat structural heart disease,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Michael Dale</span>, senior vice president of Abbott's structural heart business. ""This latest and important introduction of Portico with FlexNav represents another milestone in our work to advance our mission to restore health and improve quality of life so more people can get back to living fuller lives.""

Gubra announced the signing of a research collaboration and license agreement with Bayer AG for the development of novel peptide therapeutics to treat cardiorenal diseases. The collaboration utilizes Gubra’s machine learning-based peptide drug discovery platform (streaMLine) for fast screening and identification of potent therapeutic peptide candidates.

The joint research program between Gubra and Bayer AG aims at further maturing a novel therapeutic peptide for the potential treatment of cardiorenal disease. Cardiorenal disease is an umbrella term for acute and chronic disorders involving both the heart and the kidney. These disorders are associated with a high morbidity and mortality globally and currently available treatments are not optimal for all patients. Consequently, cardiorenal diseases cause a significant burden on health care systems around the world.

The collaboration will combine Gubra’s unique peptide drug discovery capabilities and use of advanced technologies with Bayer AG’s expertise in development of innovative medicines. The extensive experience in both companies with drug profiling in preclinical translational disease models also form an essential part of the collaboration.

“We are very pleased to enter this research collaboration and license agreement with Bayer,” said Henrik Blou, CEO of Gubra. “We have used streaMLine, our proprietary machine learning-based target and peptide drug discovery platform, to conceive this promising program currently undergoing preclinical maturation. We are pleased that the potential of our technology is being recognized by such a qualified partner capable of advancing innovative medicines into the clinic.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Gubra to receive an upfront payment and potential future development and commercialization milestones of up to € 216 million.

<strong>Basel, September 21, 2021</strong> — Novartis today announced that it has acquired Arctos Medical, adding a pre-clinical optogenetics-based AAV gene therapy program and Arctos’ proprietary technology to its ophthalmology portfolio. The acquisition underscores the Novartis commitment to finding treatments for patients with vision loss and the potential of optogenetics as the basis of successful therapeutics.

“Optogenetics is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach that might restore sight to patients who are legally blind,” said Jay Bradner, President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. “The Arctos technology builds on our conviction that optogenetic gene therapies may meaningfully help patients battling devastating eye diseases.”

Arctos developed its technology as a potential method for treating inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) and other diseases that involve photoreceptor loss, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Existing gene therapy treatments aim to correct a specific gene, so only a small subset of patients can benefit. The Arctos technology is not limited to a specific gene, and thus can potentially address many forms of IRDs regardless of the underlying mutation. Arctos’ proprietary, light-sensitive optogene is delivered to specific retinal cells using gene therapy, thus turning the targeted cells into replacement photoreceptor-like cells. If successful, a therapeutic based on such a technology could be used to treat any disease that causes blindness due to photoreceptor death.

“We’ve watched this technology develop and mature into a therapeutic program that complements our existing portfolio and gives us new optogenetics technology to wield in our efforts to bring desperately needed therapeutic options to patients for these blinding diseases,” said Cynthia Grosskreutz, Global Head of Ophthalmology at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research.

IRDs, which impact more than 2 million people globally and often result in complete blindness, can be caused by mutations in over 100 different genes.<sup>1</sup> AMD is the leading cause of visual disability, affecting an estimated 170 million people globally.<sup>2</sup> There are no curative therapies currently available for AMD.

The Arctos technology was based on discoveries by its scientific co-founders Drs. Sonja Kleinlogel and Michiel van Wyk of University of Bern, Switzerland. Arctos was originally incubated by +ND Capital and was later supported by Novartis Venture Fund through a Series A financing round led by +ND Capital.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 20, 2021-- Verastem Oncology (Nasdaq:VSTM), a biopharmaceutical company committed to advancing new medicines for patients battling cancer, today announced a clinical collaboration agreement with Amgen to evaluate the combination of VS-6766, Verastem Oncology’s investigational dual RAF/MEK inhibitor, with Amgen’s KRAS G12C inhibitor LUMAKRAS<sup>TM </sup>(sotorasib) in KRAS G12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VS-6766 in combination with LUMAKRAS<sup>TM</sup> in patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC who have not been previously treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor as well as in patients who have progressed on a KRAS G12C inhibitor. The study will therefore investigate the potential benefits of a more complete vertical blockade of the RAS pathway with the combination of VS-6766 (RAF/MEK blockade) with LUMAKRAS<sup>TM</sup> (G12C inhibition) in KRAS G12C-mutant locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

“Recent data indicate that acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors in patients occurs predominantly through additional mutations in the RAS pathway, many of which may be addressed with a downstream inhibitor such as VS-6766,”<sup>1</sup> said Ramaswamy Govindan, M.D., Professor, Department of Medicine, Oncology Division at Washington University School of Medicine and lead investigator of the study. “This clinical study of VS-6766 and LUMAKRAS<sup>TM</sup> will build on preclinical data showing synergy between these two agents, including tumor regression through deeper blockade of ERK pathway signaling.”<sup>2</sup>

“We are pleased to partner with Amgen on this important research that could potentially expand treatment options for patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC,” said Brian Stuglik, CEO of Verastem Oncology. “This collaboration advances our strategy to fully explore the potential of VS-6766 as a backbone of therapy to treat RAS pathway-driven cancers.”

Verastem Oncology expects to initiate the clinical trial with VS-6766 and LUMAKRAS<sup>TM</sup> by the end of 2021.

<b>About KRAS Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</b>

Approximately 85% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which are the single leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.<sup>3</sup> KRAS mutation occurs in approximately 25% of NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients.<sup>4</sup> Two of the most common types of KRAS mutations are G12C, which occurs in approximately 13% of patients with NSCLC adenocarcinoma, as well as G12V, which is present in approximately 7% of NSCLC.<sup>5,6</sup> Currently, there is a high unmet need in the second-line treatment of KRAS mutant NSCLC.3<sup>,7</sup>

<b>About VS-6766</b>

VS-6766 (formerly known as CH5126766 and RO5126766) is a unique inhibitor of the RAF/MEK signaling pathway. In contrast to other MEK inhibitors in development, VS-6766 blocks both MEK kinase activity and the ability of RAF to phosphorylate MEK. This unique mechanism allows VS-6766 to block MEK signaling without the compensatory activation of MEK that appears to limit the efficacy of other inhibitors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for the combination of Verastem Oncology’s investigational RAF/MEK inhibitor VS-6766, with defactinib, its FAK inhibitor, for the treatment of all patients with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) regardless of KRAS status after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy.<sup>8</sup>

Verastem Oncology has initiated Phase 2 registration-directed trials of VS-6766 with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC and in patients with recurrent KRAS-G12V mutant NSCLC as part of its RAMP (<b>R</b>af <b>A</b>nd <b>M</b>ek <b>P</b>rogram) clinical trials.

<b>About Verastem Oncology</b>

Verastem Oncology (Nasdaq: VSTM) is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new medicines to improve the lives of patients diagnosed with cancer. Our pipeline is focused on novel small molecule drugs that inhibit critical signaling pathways in cancer that promote cancer cell survival and tumor growth, including RAF/MEK inhibition and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition.

<span class=""xn-location"">MARLBOROUGH, Mass.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 21, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) announced an agreement to acquire Devoro Medical, Inc., developer of the WOLF Thrombectomy® Platform. The innovative non-console and lytic-free WOLF technology targets and rapidly captures blood clots using finger-like prongs that retrieve and remove thrombi in the arterial and venous systems.

""The addition of the WOLF platform advances our efforts to ensure physicians have the right tools to improve procedural efficiencies,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jeff Mirviss</span>, executive vice president and president, Peripheral Interventions, Boston Scientific. ""Clot management remains a core focus of our business, and upon commercialization, this highly differentiated technology will complement and expand our offerings to a full suite of interventional strategies for thromboemboli, which also includes the EkoSonic™ Endovascular System (EKOS) and the AngioJet™ Thrombectomy System.""

Boston Scientific has been a strategic investor in Devoro Medical since 2019 and currently holds an equity stake of approximately 16 percent. As a result, the transaction consists of an upfront payment of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$269 million</span> for the 84 percent stake not yet owned and up to <span class=""xn-money"">$67 million</span> upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones.<sup>+</sup>

""The WOLF platform is a compelling new option for physicians performing thrombectomy procedures and, importantly, it is designed to target and remove clots without damaging blood vessels, while also minimizing blood-loss, which may improve outcomes,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Michael R. Jaff</span>, D.O., chief medical officer and vice president of clinical affairs, technology and innovation, Peripheral Interventions, Boston Scientific. ""We look forward to accelerating the progress of this platform technology so that we help patients who are dealing with these common, yet challenging health conditions.""

On an adjusted basis, the transaction is expected to be slightly dilutive to earnings per share (EPS) in 2021, which Boston Scientific expects to offset via internal cost efficiencies and trade-offs. On a GAAP basis, the transaction will be less dilutive due to a one-time gain to be recognized at closing associated with our previously held equity interest in Devoro Medical. In 2022, the transaction is not expected to impact adjusted EPS and will be slightly dilutive on a GAAP basis due to amortization expense and acquisition-related charges. The transaction is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.

<sup>+</sup><i>Preceding consideration of current equity ownership, debt and other closing adjustments, the transaction price consists of <span class=""xn-money"">$320 million</span> up front, and up to <span class=""xn-money"">$80 million</span> upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones.</i>

WILMINGTON, Del.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Opzelura™ (ruxolitinib) cream for the short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. Opzelura<i> </i>is the first and only topical formulation of a JAK inhibitor approved in the United States. Research shows dysregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway contributes to key features of AD such as itch, inflammation and skin barrier dysfunction<sup>1</sup>.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“At Incyte, we are committed to transforming the treatment of immune-mediated dermatologic conditions like AD. We look forward to bringing Opzelura to the patient community and also continuing to explore its potential in other challenging skin diseases.”</p>
</blockquote>
“Atopic dermatitis is a chronic immune-mediated disease that can be challenging to manage. Many patients do not respond well to existing treatments and have uncontrolled disease,” said Jonathan Silverberg, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor of Dermatology and Director of Clinical Research and Contact Dermatitis at The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. “As a clinician, I am excited to have a non-steroidal topical cream like Opzelura.”

“The approval of Opzelura<i> </i>is an important advancement in the treatment of AD, and we are pleased to offer a novel topical treatment option that targets a pathway believed to be a source of inflammation,” said Hervé Hoppenot, Chief Executive Officer, Incyte. “At Incyte, we are committed to transforming the treatment of immune-mediated dermatologic conditions like AD. We look forward to bringing Opzelura<i> </i>to the patient community and also continuing to explore its potential in other challenging skin diseases.”

The FDA approval was based on data from the TRuE-AD (Topical Ruxolitinib Evaluation in Atopic Dermatitis) clinical trial program, consisting of two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies (TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD 2) evaluating the safety and efficacy of Opzelura<i> </i>in more than 1,200 adolescents and adults with mild to moderate AD. Results from the studies showed patients experienced significantly clearer skin and itch reduction when treated with Opzelura cream 1.5% twice daily (BID), compared to vehicle (non-medicated cream):
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Significantly more patients treated with Opzelura<i> </i>achieved Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) Treatment Success (IGA-TS, primary endpoint) at Week 8 (defined as an IGA score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear] with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline): 53.8% in TRuE-AD1 and 51.3% in TRuE-AD2, compared to vehicle (15.1% in TRuE-AD1, 7.6% in TRuE-AD2; P&lt;0.0001).</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Significantly more patients treated with Opzelura<i> </i>experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at Week 8, as measured by a =4-point reduction in the itch Numerical Rating Scale (itch NRS4): 52.2% in TRuE-AD1 and 50.7% in TRuE-AD2, compared to vehicle (15.4% in TRuE-AD1, 16.3% in TRuE-AD2; P&lt;0.0001), among patients with an NRS score of at least 4 at baseline.</li>
</ul>
In clinical trials, the most common (=1%) treatment-emergent adverse reactions in patients treated with Opzelura were nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, bronchitis, ear infection, eosinophil count increased, urticaria, folliculitis, tonsillitis and rhinorrhea<sup>2</sup>. See Important Safety Information below, including Boxed Warnings for serious infections, mortality, malignancy, major adverse cardiovascular events and thrombosis, seen with JAK inhibitors for inflammatory conditions.

“It can be hard for people to fully appreciate how difficult AD can be and the tremendous impact it has on patients,” said Julie Block, President &amp; CEO, National Eczema Association. “The chronic itch is difficult to cope with and related sleep issues can be exhausting. Many patients and their dermatologists are looking for additional options to meet current unmet needs in the management of AD. The approval of Opzelura<i> </i>is exciting news, and we welcome a new treatment option for our community.”

AD is a chronic skin disease affecting more than 21 million people aged 12 years and older in the U.S. and is characterized by inflammation and itch<sup>3</sup>. Signs and symptoms include irritated and itchy skin that can cause red lesions that may ooze and crust. People with AD are also more susceptible to bacterial, viral and fungal infections<sup>4</sup>.

Incyte is committed to supporting patients and removing barriers to access medicines. Eligible patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Opzelura<i> </i>have access to IncyteCARES (Connecting to Access, Reimbursement, Education and Support), a program offering patient support, including financial assistance and ongoing education and resources to eligible patients.

<b>About Opzelura</b>™<i> </i><b>(ruxolitinib) Cream</b>

Opzelura, a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, is the first and only topical JAK inhibitor approved for use in the United States for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. Use of Opzelura in combination with therapeutic biologics, other JAK inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, is not recommended.

Additionally, ruxolitinib cream is in Phase 3 development for the treatment of adolescents and adults with vitiligo in the TRuE-V clinical program.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

OPZELURA cream is for use on the skin only. Do not use OPZELURA cream in your eyes, mouth or vagina.

<b>OPZELURA may cause serious side effects, including:</b>

<b>Serious Infections: </b>OPZELURA cream contains ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib belongs to a class of medicines called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. JAK inhibitors are medicines that affect your immune system. JAK inhibitors can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have had serious infections while taking JAK inhibitors by mouth, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have been hospitalized or died from these infections. Some people have had serious infections of their lungs while taking OPZELURA. Your healthcare provider should watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with OPZELURA.

OPZELURA should not be used in people with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. You should not start using OPZELURA if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster) while using OPZELURA.

<b>Increased risk of death from all causes, including sudden cardiac death, has happened in people taking JAK inhibitors by mouth.</b>

<b>Cancer and immune system problems: </b>OPZELURA may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Some people have had lymphoma and other cancers while taking JAK inhibitors by mouth, especially if they are a current or past smoker. Some people have had skin cancers while taking OPZELURA. Your healthcare provider will regularly check your skin during your treatment with OPZELURA.

<b>There is an increased risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke or cardiac death in people with cardiovascular risk factors and who are current or past smokers while using JAK inhibitors to treat inflammatory conditions.</b>

<b>Blood clots: </b>Blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE) can happen in some people taking OPZELURA. This may be life-threatening.

<b>Low blood cell counts: </b>OPZELURA may cause low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), low red blood cell counts (anemia), and low white blood cell counts (neutropenia). If needed, your healthcare provider will do a blood test to check your blood cell counts during your treatment with OPZELURA and may stop your treatment if signs or symptoms of low blood cell counts happen.

<b>Cholesterol increases: </b>Cholesterol increase has happened in people when ruxolitinib is taken by mouth. Tell your healthcare provider if you have high cholesterol or triglycerides.

<b>Before starting OPZELURA, tell your healthcare provider if you</b>:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>have an infection, are being treated for one, or have an infection that keeps coming back</li>
 	<li>have diabetes, chronic lung disease, HIV, or a weak immune system</li>
 	<li>have TB or have been in close contact with someone with TB</li>
 	<li>have had shingles (herpes zoster) or hepatitis B or C</li>
 	<li>live, have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections. These infections may happen or become more severe if you use OPZELURA. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common.</li>

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

INGELHEIM, Germany &amp; ARLINGTON, Texas--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Boehringer Ingelheim today announced the acquisition of Abexxa Biologics Inc., a biopharmaceutical company taking a new approach in the fields of immuno-oncology and oncology research to develop the next generation of precision medicines designed to revolutionize cancer treatments. The acquisition will allow Boehringer Ingelheim to access Abexxa’s expertise in targeting cancer-specific proteins that are located inside the cell, rather than those expressed on the cell membrane. This enlarges the pool of potential cancer antigen targets. In particular, Abexxa’s technology could lead to the development of cancer immunotherapies that are effective in a broader range of patients and cancer types.

“The acquisition of Abexxa bolsters our commitment to tumor-antigen discovery and new ways of targeting intracellular antigens. Their cutting-edge know-how and technologies for antigen discovery and novel antibody generation strongly complement the current approaches we have been applying successfully to enable immune-targeting of cancer cells,” said Clive R. Wood, Ph.D., corporate senior vice president and global head of discovery research, Boehringer Ingelheim. “By expanding our portfolio of antibodies binding novel intracellular tumor antigens, we are striving to develop unique and broadly applicable new immunotherapeutic approaches for cancer patients,” added Wood.

Abexxa’s innovative platform unlocks the ability to target intracellular antigens of cancer cells by recognizing their presentation on the cell surface by MHC class 1 molecules. While the Abexxa platform addresses the more common HLA-A2 peptide presentation, the company has developed specific expertise in the nonclassical MHC class 1 molecule HLA-E, which has the potential to impact a broader set of cancer patients’ antigens. More specifically, Abexxa has developed a first-in-class T-cell receptor (TCR)-like antibody that can be used to disrupt the NKG2A:HLA-E immune checkpoint axis in oncology. Abexxa molecules are also being formulated to recruit immune cells targeting HLA-E peptide complexes on tumors.

In 2016, Boehringer Ingelheim’s Venture Fund, the arm of the company that invests in ground-breaking therapeutic and digital health approaches, awarded Abexxa initial investment funding. Later that year, Abexxa won Boehringer Ingelheim’s Innovation Prize, which facilitates business growth and rewards new companies for their dedication to innovation. The prize allowed Abexxa to expand operations into a shared lab space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to continue its research. Boehringer Ingelheim’s investment in Abexxa demonstrates how the company is seeking to foster innovation across leading biotech communities, including the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, area.

“The investment by Boehringer Ingelheim’s Venture Fund in 2016 was a defining moment for Abexxa,” said Debra Wawro Weidanz, co-founder and CEO of Abexxa. “The acquisition by Boehringer Ingelheim allows our team to access the company’s expertise and capabilities in immuno-oncology and antibody development and to have the opportunity to translate Abexxa technology into a clinical asset,” said Jon Weidanz, Ph.D., co-founder and CSO of Abexxa.

This transaction is the latest<i> </i>in a series of strategic acquisitions and collaborations that reinforce Boehringer Ingelheim’s overall oncology strategy, bringing together cancer immunology and cancer cell directed therapies to fight cancer. This strategy has further strengthened Boehringer Ingelheim’s position in oncology through the development of leading assets and robust capabilities in cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, T-cell engagers, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and myeloid and stromal cell modulators. By combining its world-class in-house research and development with that of highly innovative biotechnology companies like Abexxa, Boehringer Ingelheim is developing innovative cancer immunology therapies and accelerating the delivery of the next generation of cancer treatments.

The total transaction includes an upfront payment, milestones and other consideration payments. Abexxa will continue to operate in the Arlington, Texas, area as a Boehringer Ingelheim family company, collaborating extensively with the colleagues at Boehringer Ingelheim’s U.S. research site in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

TIVDAK is approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program based on tumor response and the durability of the response. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.<sup>1</sup>

“Once recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer progresses, there is a need for more options for these patients,” said Robert L. Coleman, M.D., Chief Scientific Officer, US Oncology Research and lead investigator of the innovaTV 204 clinical trial. “This is an important development for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.”

In the innovaTV 204 clinical trial, TIVDAK was evaluated in 101 patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who had received no more than two prior systemic regimens in the recurrent or metastatic setting, including at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Results from the trial showed a 24 percent confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (95% CI; 15.9-33.3), as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. The median duration of response (DOR) was 8.3 months (95% CI; 4.2 to not reached).

The prescribing information for TIVDAK includes a<b> BOXED WARNING </b>for ocular toxicity, and Warnings for peripheral neuropathy, hemorrhage, pneumonitis, and embryo-fetal toxicity. The most common (=25%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased (52%), fatigue (50%), lymphocytes decreased (42%), nausea (41%), peripheral neuropathy (39%), alopecia (39%), epistaxis (39%), conjunctival adverse reactions (37%), hemorrhage (32%), leukocytes decreased (30%), creatinine increased (29%), dry eye (29%), prothrombin international normalized ratio increased (26%), activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged (26%), diarrhea (25%), and rash (25%). Please see Important Safety Information below.<sup>1</sup>

“We are thrilled to see this new treatment approved by the FDA. We are grateful to have another option for this devastating disease,” said Tamika Felder, Founder, Cervivor.

“We are pleased with the accelerated approval of TIVDAK, Seagen’s third FDA-approved antibody-drug conjugate, and fourth approved medicine. Our mission at Seagen is to develop medicines that make a difference for people impacted by cancer,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Seagen.

“TIVDAK’s approval as a monotherapy in the U.S. is an important milestone for women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy, as they are in need of a new treatment option and we look forward to making it available to them,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, Genmab. “The journey towards the approval of TIVDAK started nearly two decades ago with innovative research by scientists at Genmab and Seagen and reflects on our purpose of making an impact in the lives of cancer patients and their families. Today’s announcement marks Genmab’s evolution into a fully integrated biotechnology company and we would like to thank patients, caregivers, investigators and our collaborators for their participation in our clinical studies.”

The Biologics License Application (BLA) for TIVDAK was submitted in February 2021 and accepted with Priority Review in April 2021. The submission was based on the results of the innovaTV 204 trial.

The FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program allows for approval of a medicine based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, if the medicine fills an unmet medical need for a serious condition. A global, randomized phase 3 clinical trial (innovaTV 301) is underway and is also intended to support global registrations.

<b>About Cervical Cancer</b>

It is estimated that in 2021, more than 14,480 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S., and 4,290 women will die from the disease.<sup>2</sup> Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer death in women globally, with over 311,000 women dying of the disease in 2018.<sup>3</sup>

<b>About the innovaTV 204 Trial</b>

The innovaTV 204 trial (NCT03438396/GOG-3023/ENGOT-cx6) is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm phase 2 trial that evaluated tisotumab vedotin in 101 patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who had received no more than two prior systemic regimens in the recurrent or metastatic setting, including at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients were excluded if they had active ocular surface disease, any prior episode of cicatricial conjunctivitis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Grade =2 peripheral neuropathy or known coagulation defects leading to an increased risk of bleeding. The main efficacy outcome measures were confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by an IRC and DOR.<sup>1</sup>

The study was conducted by Genmab in collaboration with Seagen, European Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial Groups (ENGOT) and the GOG Foundation, Inc. (GOG).

<b>About TIVDAK (tisotumab vedotin-tftv)</b>

TIVDAK (tisotumab vedotin-tftv) is an ADC composed of Genmab’s human monoclonal antibody directed to tissue factor (TF) and Seagen’s ADC technology that utilizes a protease-cleavable linker that covalently attaches the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) to the antibody. Nonclinical data suggests that the anticancer activity of TIVDAK is due to the binding of the ADC to TF expressing cancer cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-TF complex, and release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. MMAE disrupts the microtubule network of actively dividing cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. In vitro, TIVDAK also mediates antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.<sup>1</sup>

<b>TIVDAK (tisotumab vedotin-tftv) for injection, for intravenous use, 40 mg Important Safety Information</b>

<b>BOXED WARNING: OCULAR TOXICITY</b>

<b>TIVDAK caused changes in the corneal epithelium and conjunctiva resulting in changes in vision, including severe vision loss, and corneal ulceration. Conduct an ophthalmic exam at baseline, prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Adhere to premedication and required eye care before, during and after infusion. Withhold TIVDAK until improvement and resume, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue, based on severity.</b>

<b>Warnings and Precautions</b>

<b>Ocular Adverse Reactions </b>occurred in 60% of patients with cervical cancer treated with TIVDAK. The most common were conjunctival adverse reactions (40%), dry eye (29%), corneal adverse reactions (21%), and blepharitis (8%). Grade 3 ocular adverse reactions occurred in 3.8% of patients, including severe ulcerative keratitis in 3.2% of patients. One patient experienced ulcerative keratitis with perforation requiring corneal transplantation. Cases of symblepharon were reported in patients with other tumor types treated with TIVDAK at the recommended dose.

In innovaTV 204, 4% of patients experienced visual acuity changes to 20/50 or worse, including 1% of patients who experienced a visual acuity change to 20/200. Of the patients who experienced decreased visual acuity to 20/50 or worse, 75% resolved, including the patient who experienced decreased visual acuity to 20/200.

Refer patients to an eye care provider for an ophthalmic exam including visual acuity and slit lamp exam at baseline, prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Adhere to premedication and required eye care to reduce the risk of ocular adverse reactions. Promptly refer patients to an eye care provider for any new or worsening ocular signs and symptoms. Withhold dose, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue TIVDAK based on the severity of the adverse reaction.

<b>Peripheral neuropathy (PN) </b>occurred in 42% of cervical cancer patients treated with TIVDAK across clinical trials; 8% of patients experienced Grade 3 PN. PN adverse reactions included peripheral neuropathy (20%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (11%), peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy (5%), motor neuropathy (3%), muscular weakness (3%), and demyelinating peripheral polyneuropathy (1%). One patient with another tumor type treated with TIVDAK at the recommended dose developed Guillain- Barré syndrome.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neuropathy. For new or worsening PN, withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TIVDAK based on the severity of PN.

<b>Hemorrhage </b>occurred in 62% of cervical cancer patients treated with TIVDAK across clinical trials. The most common all grade hemorrhage adverse reactions were epistaxis (44%), hematuria (10%), and vaginal hemorrhage (10%). Grade 3 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hemorrhage. For patients experiencing pulmonary or CNS hemorrhage, permanently discontinue TIVDAK. For Grade =2 hemorrhage in any other location, withhold until bleeding has resolved, blood hemoglobin is stable, there is no bleeding diathesis that could increase the risk of continuing therapy, and there is no anatomical or pathologic condition that can increase the risk of hemorrhage recurrence. After resolution, either resume treatment or permanently discontinue TIVDAK.

<b>Pneumonitis: </b>Severe, life-threatening, or fatal pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with antibody-drug conjugates containing vedotin, including TIVDAK. Among patients with cervical cancer treated with TIVDAK across clinical trials, 2 patients (1.3%) experienced pneumonitis, including 1 patient who had a fatal outcome.

Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for symptoms should be excluded through appropriate investigations.

Withhold TIVDAK for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue TIVDAK in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis.

<b>Embryo-fetal toxicity: </b>TIVDAK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TIVDAK and for 2 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TIVDAK and for 4 months after the last dose.

<b>Adverse Reactions</b>

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 43% of patients; the most common (=3%) were ileus (6%), hemorrhage (5%), pneumonia (4%), PN, sepsis, constipation, and pyrexia (each 3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4% of patients who received TIVDAK, including septic shock, pneumonitis, sudden death, and multisystem organ failure (each 1%).

Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 13% of patients receiving TIVDAK; the most common (=3%) were PN (5%) and corneal adverse reactions (4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 47% of patients; the most common (=3%) were PN (8%), conjunctival adverse reactions (4%), and hemorrhage (4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (=3%) were conjunctival adverse reactions (9%) and corneal adverse reactions (8%).

The most common (=25%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased (52%), fatigue (50%), lymphocytes decreased (42%), nausea (41%), PN (39%), alopecia (39%), epistaxis (39%), conjunctival adverse reactions (37%), hemorrhage (32%), leukocytes decreased (30%), creatinine increased (29%), dry eye (29%), prothrombin international normalized ratio increased (26%), activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged (26%), diarrhea (25%), and rash (25%).

<b>Drug interactions</b>

<b>Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: </b>Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase unconjugated monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) exposure, which may increase the risk of TIVDAK adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients for TIVDAK adverse reactions.

<b>Use in Specific Populations</b>

<b>Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: </b>MMAE exposure and adverse reactions are increased. Avoid use.

<b>Lactation:</b> Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during TIVDAK treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.

ALAMEDA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 20, 2021-- <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.exelixis.com%2F&amp;esheet=52493050&amp;newsitemid=20210920005331&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Exelixis%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=818dc603be069f22b117eaebfeeae345"" rel=""nofollow"">Exelixis, Inc.</a> (Nasdaq: EXEL) today announced final results from the phase 3 COSMIC-311 pivotal trial of CABOMETYX<sup>®</sup> (cabozantinib) in patients with previously treated radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Following a previous <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.exelixis.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fexelixis-announces-cabozantinib-significantly-improved&amp;esheet=52493050&amp;newsitemid=20210920005331&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announcement&amp;index=2&amp;md5=73ce874ee89449ab95651f4e89034862"" rel=""nofollow"">announcement</a> that the trial met one of the two primary endpoints of significant improvement versus placebo in progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent radiology committee (BIRC; p&lt;0.0001), the results of the final analysis are being presented during the Mini Oral Session – NETs and Endocrine Tumours at 5:30 p.m. CEST on Monday, September 20 at the 2021 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress (LBA67). At a median follow-up of 10.1 months, the significant improvement in PFS with CABOMETYX was maintained, with consistent benefit in subgroups based on prior treatment.

“Given the urgent need for new treatments for differentiated thyroid cancer, I’m encouraged to see that cabozantinib benefited patients in COSMIC-311 both at a longer follow-up and across prior therapy subgroups,” said Jaume Capdevila, M.D., Ph.D., Medical Oncologist at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital and Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), Barcelona, and a COSMIC-311 study investigator. “These strong findings, which formed the basis for the recent U.S. FDA approval, further support cabozantinib as an important new treatment option for patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who previously had no standard of care following disease progression on anti-VEGFR therapy.”

At a median follow-up of 10.1 months, CABOMETYX reduced the risk of disease progression or death versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.22; 96% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15–0.32) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Median PFS as assessed by BIRC was 11.0 months for patients treated with CABOMETYX (n=170) compared with 1.9 months for patients treated with placebo (n=88). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that CABOMETYX improved PFS versus placebo irrespective of prior exposure to lenvatinib and/or sorafenib:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Prior sorafenib/no lenvatinib: median PFS was 16.6 months for patients treated with CABOMETYX (n=63) compared with 3.2 months for placebo (n=33) (HR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.06–0.26).</li>
 	<li>Prior lenvatinib/no sorafenib: median PFS was 5.8 months for patients treated with CABOMETYX (n=68) compared with 1.9 months for placebo (n=34) (HR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.16–0.48).</li>
 	<li>Prior sorafenib and lenvatinib: median PFS was 7.6 months for patients treated with CABOMETYX (n=39) compared with 1.9 months for placebo (n=21) (HR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.13–0.54).</li>
</ul>
An updated analysis for the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by BIRC in the ITT population favored CABOMETYX at 11%, including one complete response, versus 0% for placebo. Median overall survival, an additional endpoint, was 19.4 months for patients treated with CABOMETYX and not estimable for patients treated with placebo (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.45–1.31).

The safety profile was consistent with that previously observed for CABOMETYX, and adverse events (AEs) were managed with dose modifications. The discontinuation rate due to treatment-emergent AEs was 8.8% for CABOMETYX versus 0% for placebo. Rates of grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AEs were 62% for CABOMETYX versus 28% for placebo, with no treatment-related deaths. Dose reductions due to AEs were required in 67% of patients treated with CABOMETYX versus 5% for placebo.

“Following the recent U.S. FDA approval, we are pleased to share these detailed results at this year’s ESMO which show CABOMETYX continued to benefit these patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer in the trial at a longer follow-up,” said Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, Exelixis. “This patient population faces a poor prognosis and previously had very limited treatment options. We are thrilled that eligible patients in the U.S. now have CABOMETYX as an approved treatment option and will continue to work with our partners on their efforts to bring CABOMETYX to even more patients worldwide.”

Results from COSMIC-311 served as the basis for the September 17, 2021 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.exelixis.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fexelixis-announces-us-fda-approval-cabometyxr-cabozantinib-3&amp;esheet=52493050&amp;newsitemid=20210920005331&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=approval&amp;index=3&amp;md5=dccb606f1efa74b8d1e96236cd35257a"" rel=""nofollow"">approval</a> of CABOMETYX for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible. The application was approved well ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of December 4, 2021.

<b>About COSMIC-311
</b>COSMIC-311 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 pivotal trial that enrolled 258 patients at 164 sites globally. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either CABOMETYX 60 mg or placebo once daily. The primary endpoints were PFS and ORR. Exelixis is sponsoring COSMIC-311, and Ipsen is co-funding the trial. More information about this trial is available at <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03690388&amp;esheet=52493050&amp;newsitemid=20210920005331&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=ClinicalTrials.gov&amp;index=4&amp;md5=1a07fb63165eb770a351c84d4f0f0a5f"" rel=""nofollow"">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>.

<b>About DTC
</b>Approximately 44,000 new cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2021.<sup>1</sup> Nearly three out of four of these cases will be in women, and the disease is more commonly diagnosed at a younger age compared to most other adult cancers.<sup>2</sup> While cancerous thyroid tumors include differentiated, medullary and anaplastic forms, differentiated thyroid tumors make up about 90% of cases.<sup>2</sup> These include papillary, follicular and Hürthle cell cancer.<sup>2</sup> DTC is typically treated with surgery followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue with radioiodine, but approximately 5% to 15% of cases are resistant to radioiodine treatment.<sup> 2,3</sup> For these patients, life expectancy is only three to five years from the time metastatic lesions are detected.<sup>4,5,6</sup>

<b>About CABOMETYX</b><sup>®</sup><b> (cabozantinib)
</b>In the U.S., CABOMETYX tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have been previously treated with sorafenib; for patients with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab; and for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in the European Union and additional countries and regions worldwide. In 2016, Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the U.S. and Japan. In 2017, Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize cabozantinib in the U.S.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>Hemorrhage: </b>Severe and fatal hemorrhages occurred with CABOMETYX. The incidence of Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhagic events was 5% in CABOMETYX patients in RCC, HCC, and DTC studies. Discontinue CABOMETYX for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage and prior to surgery as recommended. Do not administer CABOMETYX to patients who have a recent history of hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, hematemesis, or melena.

<b>Perforations and Fistulas: </b>Fistulas, including fatal cases, occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, including fatal cases, occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of fistulas and perforations, including abscess and sepsis. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who experience a Grade 4 fistula or a GI perforation.

<b>Thrombotic Events: </b>CABOMETYX increased the risk of thrombotic events. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 7% (including 4% pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism in 2% of CABOMETYX patients. Fatal thrombotic events occurred in CABOMETYX patients. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or serious arterial or venous thromboembolic events that require medical intervention.

<b>Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis: </b>CABOMETYX can cause hypertension, including hypertensive crisis. Hypertension was reported in 37% (16% Grade 3 and &lt;1% Grade 4) of CABOMETYX patients. Do not initiate CABOMETYX in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Monitor blood pressure regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. Withhold CABOMETYX for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with medical management; when controlled, resume at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue CABOMETYX for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy or for hypertensive crisis.

<b>Diarrhea: </b>Diarrhea occurred in 62% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 10% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor and manage patients using antidiarrheals as indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to = Grade 1, resume at a reduced dose.

<b>Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE): </b>PPE occurred in 45% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 PPE occurred in 13% of CABOMETYX patients. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to Grade 1 and resume at a reduced dose for intolerable Grade 2 PPE or Grade 3 PPE.

<b>Hepatotoxicity: </b>CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to CABOMETYX alone.

Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes than when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt CABOMETYX and nivolumab and consider administering corticosteroids.

With the combination of CABOMETYX and nivolumab, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients. ALT or AST &gt;3 times ULN (Grade =2) was reported in 83 patients, of whom 23 (28%) received systemic corticosteroids; ALT or AST resolved to Grades 0-1 in 74 (89%). Among the 44 patients with Grade =2 increased ALT or AST who were rechallenged with either CABOMETYX (n=9) or nivolumab (n=11) as a single agent or with both (n=24), recurrence of Grade =2 increased ALT or AST was observed in 2 patients receiving CABOMETYX, 2 patients receiving nivolumab, and 7 patients receiving both CABOMETYX and nivolumab. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose based on severity.

<b>Adrenal Insufficiency: </b>CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX and/or nivolumab and resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose depending on severity.

Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 4.7% (15/320) of patients with RCC who received CABOMETYX with nivolumab, including Grade 3 (2.2%), and Grade 2 (1.9%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 0.9% and withholding of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 2.8% of patients with RCC.

Approximately 80% (12/15) of patients with adrenal insufficiency received hormone replacement therapy, including systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 27% (n=4) of the 15 patients. Of the 9 patients in whom CABOMETYX with nivolumab was withheld for adrenal insufficiency, 6 reinstated treatment after symptom improvement; of these, all (n=6) received hormone replacement therapy and 2 had recurrence of adrenal insufficiency.

<b>Proteinuria: </b>Proteinuria was observed in 8% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor urine protein regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. For Grade 2 or 3 proteinuria, withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to<b> </b>= Grade 1 proteinuria, resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose.<b> </b>Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.

<b>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ): </b>ONJ occurred in &lt;1% of CABOMETYX patients. ONJ can manifest as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration or erosion, persistent jaw pain, or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery. Perform an oral examination prior to CABOMETYX initiation and periodically during treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. Withhold CABOMETYX for development of ONJ until complete resolution, resume at a reduced dose.

<b>Impaired Wound Healing: </b>Wound complications occurred with CABOMETYX. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer CABOMETYX for at least 2 weeks after major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of CABOMETYX after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.

<b>Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): </b>RPLS, a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic findings on MRI, can occur with CABOMETYX. Evaluate for RPLS in patients presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion, or altered mental function. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop RPLS.

<b>Thyroid Dysfunction:</b> Thyroid dysfunction, primarily hypothyroidism, has been observed with CABOMETYX. Based on the safety population, thyroid dysfunction occurred in 19% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 0.4% of patients.

Patients should be assessed for signs of thyroid dysfunction prior to the initiation of CABOMETYX and monitored for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction during CABOMETYX treatment. Thyroid function testing and management of dysfunction should be performed as clinically indicated.

<b>Hypocalcemia:</b> CABOMETYX can cause hypocalcemia. Based on the safety population, hypocalcemia occurred in 13% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 2% and Grade 4 in 1% of patients. Laboratory abnormality data were not collected in CABOSUN.

In COSMIC-311, hypocalcemia occurred in 36% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 6% and Grade 4 in 3% of patients.

Monitor blood calcium levels and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue CABOMETYX depending on severity.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: </b>CABOMETYX can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CABOMETYX and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>

The most common (=20%) adverse reactions are:

CABOMETYX as a single agent: diarrhea, fatigue, PPE, decreased appetite, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, weight decreased, constipation.

CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab:<b> </b>diarrhea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, PPE, stomatitis, rash, hypertension, hypothyroidism, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, dysgeusia, abdominal pain, cough, and upper respiratory tract infection.

<b>DRUG INTERACTIONS</b>

<b>Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: </b>If coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the CABOMETYX dosage. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice.

<b>Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: </b>If coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, increase the CABOMETYX dosage. Avoid St. John’s wort.

<b>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</b>

<b>Lactation: </b>Advise women not to breastfeed during CABOMETYX treatment and for 4 months after the final dose.

Under the terms of the agreement, Takeda will be responsible for regulatory approval and commercialization of maralixibat in Japan. Takeda will also be responsible for development, including conducting clinical studies in cholestatic indications.

“Takeda is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with extensive experience in development and commercialization of novel therapies to treat rare diseases as well as gastroenterology and hepatology, making them an ideal partner as we look to accelerate the delivery of maralixibat to children living with rare liver diseases in Japan,” said Chris Peetz, president and chief executive officer of Mirum. “As we approach potential commercialization in the United States and complete the recent filing for Alagille syndrome in Europe, our goal is to partner with top companies outside of North America and Europe to ensure global reach for patients with these terrible diseases. We are excited for Takeda to engage in the development of maralixibat and collaborate in our effort to advance this potentially life-changing therapy.”

“There is a significant unmet medical need for a treatment to help patients with cholestatic diseases such as ALGS and PFIC in Japan and developing novel treatment for those patients suffering from rare liver diseases is a top priority for Takeda’s global R&amp;D strategy,” said Dr. Naoyoshi Hirota, general manager of Takeda development center Japan. “This agreement reinforces Takeda’s commitment to developing highly differentiated medicines to improve the health and quality of life of patients.”

Mirum has submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for maralixibat for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome. The NDA is currently under priority review with a PDUFA, or FDA decision date, of September 29, 2021.

<b>About Maralixibat</b>

Maralixibat is a novel, minimally absorbed, orally administered investigational drug being evaluated in several rare cholestatic liver diseases. Maralixibat inhibits the apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), resulting in more bile acids being excreted in the feces, leading to lower levels of bile acids systemically, thereby potentially reducing bile acid mediated effects. More than 1,600 individuals have received maralixibat, including more than 120 children who have received maralixibat as an investigational treatment for Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted maralixibat Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of pruritus associated with ALGS in patients one year of age and older and for PFIC2. Maralixibat was shown to have a tolerable safety profile in the studies. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. Maralixibat has been studied extensively and its safety database represents the largest database for an ASBT inhibitor.

Until maralixibat is approved and available for prescribing, the medication is available to patients with ALGS through Mirum’s expanded access program.

<strong>Phase 1/2 Dose Expansion Studies in Recurrent Glioblastoma and Pancreatic Cancer Completed; Results to be Reported at Key Medical Meetings During Q4 2021</strong>

<strong>Company Plans to Initiate Global Phase 2/3 Registration Study for VT1021 in Glioblastoma by the End of 2021</strong>

<strong>Cambridge MA – September 21, 2021 (PR Newswire)</strong> – Vigeo Therapeutics, a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company pioneering novel cancer therapies, today announced completion of the Phase 1/2 dose expansion studies evaluating its lead asset VT1021 in recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) and pancreatic cancer.

VT1021 is a first-in-class, dual-modulating compound that both blocks the CD47 immune checkpoint and reprograms the CD36 receptor to induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis. In the completed open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 study (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03364400?term=NCT03364400&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1"">NCT03364400</a>), the safety and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of single-agent VT1021 was evaluated in subjects enrolled in both dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts. The escalation cohort included all-comers, and the expansion cohorts focused on rGBM and pancreatic cancer, among other indications.

<strong>Phase 1/2 Results in Recurrent Glioblastoma and Pancreatic Cancer</strong>

In the rGBM expansion cohort, single-agent VT1021 demonstrated complete tumor regression in multiple subjects and partial response in other subjects, with multiple subjects remaining on trial for well over 9 months. While the expansion study has concluded, these subjects will continue to receive VT1021 in an open label extension study.

In the pancreatic cancer expansion cohort, single-agent VT1021 demonstrated tumor reduction in multiple subjects with measurable disease. Moreover, VT1021 was able to reprogram the tumor immune microenvironment from immune-suppressive to immune-responsive.

Vigeo plans to present the results of both of these studies at medical meetings during the fourth quarter of 2021. The company is expected to initiate a global, Phase 2/3 registration study evaluating VT1021 in newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM patients by the end of 2021. In parallel, Vigeo plans to initiate efficacy studies in additional solid tumor indications, including pancreatic cancer, during the first half of 2022.

Jim Mahoney, Chief Executive Officer of Vigeo, commented, “VT1021 is a first-in-class anti-cancer agent that works by stimulating the expression of Tsp-1 which then binds with high affinity to CD47, blocking the “do not eat me” signal, and to CD36, which leads to a cascade of beneficial changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) that further enhance anti-tumor effects. We, along with the PI’s who conducted the trials, are very excited by what we have observed to date in the two expansion studies.”

Mr. Mahoney was appointed Chief Executive Officer in February of this year. Jing Watnick, PhD, MBA, Vigeo founder and previous CEO, is remaining on as the COO and will focus her efforts on developing the clinical and preclinical assets.

Prior to joining Vigeo as CEO, Mr. Mahoney served as a member of the Vigeo Board of Directors since 2015. In his new role, Mr. Mahoney will lead the development of Vigeo’s corporate strategy and will drive a disciplined growth strategy as Vigeo executes on its clinical programs.

Mr. Mahoney has over 30 years of senior executive experience at various biotechnology, healthcare and specialty chemicals companies. Most recently, he was an Operating Partner at Ara Partners, a private equity investment firm. Prior to that he served as CEO and President at Novomer Inc., Surface Logix Inc., and Prolinx Inc. and was a founding senior executive at Dade Behring Inc. Earlier, he held executive positions at Baxter International and FMC Corporation. Mr. Mahoney received his BS degree from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and holds an MBA from Northwestern University’s J.L. Kellogg School of Management and an MMA in international economics from the University of Southern California.

<strong>About VT1021?</strong>
Vigeo’s lead asset, VT1021, is a first-in-class dual modulating compound that blocks the CD47 immune checkpoint and activates CD36, which induces apoptosis and increases the M1:M2 macrophage ratio. VT1021 achieves this through stimulation of thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1). The goal of these dual-modulating effects is conversion of immuno-suppressive, or “cold,” tumors that don’t respond to immuno-oncology agents, to immuno-stimulated, or “hot,” tumors that are potentially more receptive to immuno-oncology agents. Vigeo is developing VT1021 as a therapeutic agent across a range of cancers, with a current focus on solid tumors.

<strong>About Vigeo Therapeutics</strong>
Based in Cambridge, MA, Vigeo Therapeutics is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company pioneering novel cancer therapies. The company is building a first-in-class drug development pipeline being led by VT1021, its dual-modulating compound that blocks the CD47 immune checkpoint and reprograms CD36 mediated activities. Single-agent VT1021 has been investigated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors, and is currently progressing to late-stage clinical development.

<span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span> and SUZHOU, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 22, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> has accepted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin plus paclitaxel or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil) for the first-line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).

The sNDA application is based on the interim analysis of the global randomized, double-blind, multi-center Phase 3 ORIENT-15 clinical trial – which evaluated sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy compared to placebo in combination with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for ESCC. Based on the interim analysis conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in combination with chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 expression status. The results of ORIENT-15 were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2021 on <span class=""xn-chron"">September 17</span>.

The principal investigator of the ORIENT-15 study, Prof. <span class=""xn-person"">Shen Lin</span> from Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, stated,"" Esophageal cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, and squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histologic type. In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, cisplatin plus paclitaxel is widely used to treat patients with ESCC. The results of ORIENT-15 demonstrated that sintilimab plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy. These results suggest that this sintilimab regimen could be a suitable treatment option for ESCC patients in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.""

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Hui Zhou</span>, Senior Vice President of Innovent, stated, ""There is a huge unmet clinical need for advanced or metastatic ESCC. The acceptance of this sNDA by the NMPA represents an important milestone in demonstrating the potential value of sintilimab in the first-line treatment of ESCC. We look forward to working with the <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> regulatory authorities on the sNDA review and we hope to bring the new regimen of sintilimab plus cisplatin and paclitaxel to Chinese patients with ESCC as quickly as possible.""

<b>About the ORIENT-15 Study</b>

ORIENT-15 is a global randomized, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 clinical study evaluating sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin plus paclitaxel or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]), compared to placebo in combination with chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03748134"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03748134</a>). At the time of interim analysis, a total of 659 eligible patients (of the planned 676 estimated participants) were enrolled and randomly assigned into the experimental group or control group in a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) in all randomized patients and OS in PD-L1 positive (defined as CPS =10) patients.

<b>About Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)</b>

Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide that begins in the inner layer (mucosa) of the esophagus, which connects the throat to the stomach. Based on GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates, approximately 600,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed and approximately 540,000 deaths result from the disease worldwide each year. Esophageal cancer is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer and the sixth leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. More than half of new and fatal cases of esophageal cancer in the world occur in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, it is estimated there were approximately 320,000 new cases of esophageal cancer diagnosed and approximately 300,000 deaths resulting from the disease in 2020. Esophageal cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, where it has a five-year survival rate of only 30%. In the US, it is estimated there were approximately 18,000 new cases of esophageal cancer diagnosed and approximately 16,000 deaths resulting from the disease in 2020. The five-year survival rate of esophageal cancer is only 20% in the US.

The two main types of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma. In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, SCC is the predominant histologic type, accounting for more than 90% of all esophageal cancer. In western countries, SCC is approximately 25% of all esophageal cancer. In the past, first-line standard systemic therapy was chemotherapy based on platinum drugs for unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic ESCC. Pembrolizumab has been approved as first-line treatment in combination with chemotherapy.

<b>About Sintilimab</b>

Sintilimab, marketed as TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, is an innovative PD-1 inhibitor with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Eli Lilly and Company. Sintilimab is an immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1 / PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies of sintilimab to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials.

In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, sintilimab has been approved for four indications, including:
<ul>
 	<li>The treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy</li>
 	<li>In combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
 	<li>In combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
 	<li>In combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) for the first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma</li>
</ul>
Additionally, Innovent currently has two regulatory submissions under review in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> for sintilimab, for the first line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and the second-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Innovent also has additional two clinical studies of sintilimab that have met their primary endpoints:
<ul>
 	<li>In combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine for the first-line treatment of unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.</li>
 	<li>The second-line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma</li>
</ul>
In <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2021</span>, the U.S. FDA accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Sintilimab was included in <span class=""xn-location"">China's</span> National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in 2019 as the first PD-1 inhibitor and the only PD-1 included in the list in that year.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Sept. 22, 2021 — Abbott today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the company’s Epic™ Plus and Epic Plus Supra Stented Tissue Valves to improve therapy options for people with aortic or mitral valve disease. These next-generation devices build off Abbott’s Epic surgical valve platform – which has a decades-long history of safety and strong clinical outcomes – and include innovations that make implantation of the valve and future cardiac interventions easier.

Heart valve disease occurs when one or more of the heart’s four valves doesn’t open or close properly, disrupting blood flow to the body, and most commonly impacts the aortic and mitral valves. When diseased or damaged heart valves can’t be repaired, they may be surgically replaced with either mechanical or bioprosthetic (tissue) valves in an open-heart surgical procedure. Bioprosthetic valves like Epic Plus do not require long-term use of blood-thinner medication, making them the recommended option for people who can’t take blood thinners or are over 70 years of age (a group that has an increased bleeding risk from taking these medicines).

More than 100,000 people in the U.S. have conventional heart valve surgeries each year,[i] which are often life-saving procedures. The approval of the new Epic Plus tissue valves provides an important treatment option for patients undergoing valve replacement surgery without the need for long-term blood thinners, while providing a durable solution that allows for reinterventions as needed.

“Doctors and patients have long depended on the Epic valve platform to help improve the quality of life for people in need of a surgical heart valve replacement,” said Vinayak Bapat, M.D., chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Abbott Northwestern Hospital. “With advancements made to Epic Plus, physicians can be assured of a reliable, longer-term solution for their patients needing a replacement heart valve that will also allow for future cardiac interventions if necessary due to the valve’s accommodating design.”

Enhancements to Epic Plus include more radiopaque markers (reference points that are visible on radiographic scans) that make it easier for doctors to navigate if future transcatheter procedures are needed. In keeping with the Epic surgical valve platform, the new valves are designed to deliver long-term performance and durability due to Abbott’s unique anticalcification technology. The Epic Plus Mitral holder, which helps to ensure precise insertion of the valve, also has a lower profile so physicians have a better view of the device for accurate placement during implantation. The device can be implanted in the aortic or mitral valve position and in patients with more complicated anatomies.

“Whether it’s developing new treatment options or improving upon our existing proven therapies, Abbott is constantly striving to deliver innovative solutions to address life-threatening heart conditions,” said Michael Dale, senior vice president of Abbott’s structural heart business. “This FDA approval affirms our commitment to advancement of the Epic Platform and our mission to help people live better lives through better health.”

The Epic Plus Stented Tissue Valves are the latest addition to Abbott’s portfolio of surgical tissue and mechanical heart valves. The company is also the global leader in mechanical heart valves with more than three million people treated worldwide.

“GVHD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients following an allogeneic stem cell transplant, yet there historically have been limited treatment options available beyond first-line systemic therapies,” stated Steven Stein, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Incyte. “Incyte is proud to have contributed to the overall scientific understanding of GVHD through our REACH program, which has led to important treatment advances on behalf of patients and the medical community, including today’s approval of Jakafi for certain people who develop chronic GVHD.”

The FDA approval was based on the REACH3 study, a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of Jakafi in comparison to best available therapy (BAT) for treatment of steroid-refractory chronic GVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The primary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) at Week 24 (i.e., Cycle 7 Day 1) was 49.7% for Jakafi compared to 25.6% for BAT (P&lt;0.0001)<sup>1</sup>. Furthermore, the ORR through Cycle 7 Day 1 was 70% for Jakafi compared to 57% for BAT<sup>2</sup>. The most common hematologic adverse reactions (incidence &gt; 35%) were anemia and thrombocytopenia. The most common nonhematologic adverse reactions (incidence = 20%) were infections (pathogen not specified) and viral infection. Full results from the REACH3 study <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.incyte.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2FIncyte-Announces-Positive-Phase-3-REACH3-Study-Data-Published-in-NEJM-for-Ruxolitinib-Jakafi-in-Chronic-Graft-Versus-Host-Disease%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;esheet=52496289&amp;newsitemid=20210922005863&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=were+published&amp;index=1&amp;md5=c55cf069cb22eb9fd7fdba48ee3f3cae"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">were published</a> in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).</i>

“Nearly half of the people who develop chronic GVHD do not respond adequately to steroids – the current standard of care – making this life-threatening condition particularly challenging to treat,” said Dr. Robert Zeiser, University Medical Center Freiburg, Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Freiburg, Germany, the principal investigator of the REACH3 trial. “In this clinical trial, treatment with Jakafi demonstrated significantly improved outcomes across a range of efficacy measures compared to best available therapy. This approval represents a significant advancement in the treatment of appropriate patients with chronic GVHD – for both the patients who face a poor prognosis and the healthcare providers who struggle to effectively treat them.”

GVHD is a condition that can occur after an allogeneic stem cell transplant (the transfer of stem cells from a donor) in which the donated cells initiate an immune response and attack the transplant recipient’s organs. There are two major forms of GVHD: acute, which generally occurs within 100 days of transplant, and chronic, which generally occurs more than 100 days after transplant<sup>3</sup>. Both forms are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and can affect multiple organ systems.

“In the U.S., there are over 14,000 people living with chronic GVHD, many of whom face significant complications that may impair daily activities and linger for years,” said Susan Stewart, Executive Director, BMT InfoNet. “The approval of Jakafi is an exciting development for the GVHD community and an important step forward in the treatment of a disease with few options.”

Jakafi’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) in chronic GHVD was reviewed under the FDA’s Priority Review program as well as the Project Orbis program, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among its international partners. Participating countries for this application include Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Brazil and the United Kingdom.

Incyte is committed to supporting patients and removing barriers to access medicines. Eligible patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Jakafi have access to IncyteCARES (Connecting to Access, Reimbursement, Education and Support), a comprehensive program offering patient support, including financial assistance and ongoing education and resources to eligible patients.

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced positive results from a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a three-day course of Veklury<sup>®</sup> (remdesivir) for intravenous (IV) use for the treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients at high risk for disease progression. This late-breaking data will be presented at the IDWeek 2021 virtual conference.

In an analysis of 562 participants randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Veklury or placebo, Veklury demonstrated a statistically significant 87% reduction in risk for the composite primary endpoint of COVID-19 related hospitalization or all-cause death by Day 28 (0.7% [2/279]) compared with placebo (5.3% [15/283]) p=0.008. Results also showed an 81% reduction in risk for the composite secondary endpoint of medical visits due to COVID-19 or all-cause death by Day 28 for participants treated with Veklury (1.6% [4/246]) compared with placebo (8.3% [21/252]) p=0.002. In the study, no deaths were observed in either arm by Day 28.

Enrollment for this trial was stopped prior to fulfilling enrollment targets in April 2021, reflecting the changing epidemiology and adoption of additional treatment options at the time; however, the study continued to collect data on enrolled participants and both investigators and participants remained blinded to their assignment of Veklury or placebo. These results complement positive results from ACTT-1 and other studies in hospitalized patients in which Veklury helped patients recover significantly faster and reduced the likelihood of disease progression.

“Antiviral medications provide maximal benefit when used early in the disease course. Last summer, data from clinical trials demonstrated the benefit of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, even when not yet requiring oxygen. These latest data show remdesivir’s potential to help high-risk patients recover before they get sicker and stay out of the hospital altogether,” said Robert L. Gottlieb, MD, PhD, Cardiologist and Principal Investigator at Baylor University Medical Center and Baylor Scott &amp; White Research Institute. “We are seeing very high numbers of hospitalized patients as new COVID-19 infections surge, placing increased demands on already over-burdened healthcare systems. Remdesivir, also known as Veklury, is an effective antiviral for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and an essential tool to help reduce disease progression.”

The use of Veklury for the treatment of non-hospitalized patients with three days of dosing is investigational, and the safety and efficacy for this use and dosing duration have not been established or approved by any regulatory agency globally. In the United States, Veklury is indicated for adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Veklury is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to Veklury or any of its components; please see below for additional Important Safety Information for Veklury.

The safety profile was similar between Veklury and placebo in this trial, with the most common treatment emergent adverse events (=5%) in patients taking Veklury being nausea and headache. Of the 279 participants who received Veklury, no new safety signals were identified. One death was observed in the study at Day 59 (participant on placebo); no deaths occurred in either arm of the study by the Day 28 primary endpoint. Gilead is in the process of sharing the data with regulatory agencies.

“As the pandemic continues to evolve and new viral variants emerge, Veklury is playing a critical role as the antiviral standard of care for hospitalized patients, helping prevent disease progression and speed patients’ recovery,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “As leaders in antiviral drug development, we welcome these findings and continue to invest in research of Veklury and novel oral antivirals to address the unmet need for effective and convenient therapies that can be administered at home.”

Gilead continues to study the efficacy and safety of Veklury in hospitalized patient populations with ongoing unmet needs, such as patients with renal impairment, children and pregnant women, as well as through the support of a number of externally sponsored trials. Gilead is also developing novel oral treatment options for non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hopes to file investigational new drug applications (IND) with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by early next year.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About the IV Outpatient Study (GS-US-540-9012)
</span></b>Study GS-US-540-9012 (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04501952&amp;esheet=52495669&amp;newsitemid=20210922005622&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=PINETREE&amp;index=1&amp;md5=dd97c551bcb08a4a6037814534de87c7"" rel=""nofollow"">PINETREE</a>) was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of a three-day course of Veklury IV in reducing the rate of hospitalization or all-cause death among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for disease progression. The primary study endpoint was the composite of COVID-19 hospitalization or all-cause death by Day 28. The composite endpoint of medical visits due to COVID-19 or all-cause death by Day 28 was a secondary outcome measure.

The study was designed to enroll 1,264 participants, randomized in a double-blind fashion so that half of enrolled participants would receive Veklury and the other half would receive a matched placebo. Gilead decided to stop the study in April 2021, reflecting the evolution of the COVID-19 landscape and changing patient needs. At the time that enrollment was terminated, 584 participants were enrolled. The study remained blinded and participants already enrolled in the study were followed according to the protocol until the last patient visit occurred, and at that point the study was closed.

This trial was designed to evaluate the potential role of Veklury in helping patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were considered high-risk for disease progression based on comorbidities and age but had not recently been hospitalized due to the infection. Common comorbidities in study participants included obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. A third of the participants were aged 60 or older. Participants in the study must have received a positive diagnosis within four days of initiating treatment and experienced symptoms for seven days or less.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Veklury
</span></b>Veklury (remdesivir) is a nucleotide analog invented by Gilead, building on more than a decade of the company’s antiviral research. Veklury is the antiviral standard of care for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. At this time, more than half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States are treated with Veklury. Veklury is approved or authorized for temporary use in approximately 50 countries worldwide and generic remdesivir, manufactured by our voluntary licensing partners, is provided to 127 middle- and low-income countries. Veklury and generic remdesivir have been made available to more than seven million patients around the world. Veklury has broad-spectrum antiviral activity both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens, including Ebola, SARS, Marburg, and MERS.

Veklury is a nucleotide analog that directly inhibits viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the viral RNA polymerase inside of the cell. On entering the body Veklury is transformed into the active metabolite remdesivir triphosphate, which is then incorporated into the viral RNA and stops replication of the virus within the host cell. No known variations have significantly altered the viral RNA polymerase. All known novel virus variants show mutations at different locations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is on the outer surface of the virus and can cause decreased affinity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Veklury’s antiviral activity has been tested against isolates of variants of concern (VOCs), including Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, and Epsilon, as well as one variant of interest (VOI) of SARS-CoV-2. These laboratory findings suggest that Veklury will continue to be active against the currently identified variations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">U.S. Indication for Veklury
</span></b>Veklury<sup>®</sup> (remdesivir 100 mg for injection) is indicated for adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Veklury should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">U.S. Important Safety Information for Veklury
</span></b><strong>Contraindication
</strong>Veklury is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions to Veklury or any of its components.

<strong>Warnings and precautions</strong>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions: Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, has been observed during and following administration of Veklury. Monitor patients under close medical supervision for hypersensitivity reactions during and following administration of Veklury. Symptoms may include hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, nausea, diaphoresis, and shivering. Slower infusion rates (maximum infusion time =120 minutes) can potentially prevent these reactions. If a severe infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue Veklury and initiate appropriate treatment (see Contraindications).</li>
 	<li>Increased risk of transaminase elevations: Transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers and in patients with COVID-19 who received Veklury; these elevations have also been reported as a clinical feature of COVID-19. Perform hepatic laboratory testing in all patients (see Dosage and administration). Consider discontinuing Veklury if ALT levels increase to &gt;10x ULN. Discontinue Veklury if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation.</li>
 	<li>Risk of reduced antiviral activity when coadministered with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine: Coadministration of Veklury with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended based on data from cell culture experiments, demonstrating potential antagonism, which may lead to a decrease in antiviral activity of Veklury.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Adverse reactions</strong>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>The most common adverse reaction (=5% all grades) was nausea.</li>
 	<li>The most common lab abnormalities (=5% all grades) were increases in ALT and AST.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Drug interactions</strong>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Drug interaction trials of Veklury and other concomitant medications have not been conducted in humans.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Dosage and administration</strong>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Dosage: For adults and pediatric patients =12 years old and weighing =40 kg: 200 mg on Day 1, followed by once-daily maintenance doses of 100 mg from Day 2 administered only via intravenous infusion over 30 to 120 minutes.</li>
 	<li>Treatment duration: For patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): 5 days; may be extended up to 5 additional days (10 days total) if clinical improvement is not observed. For patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO: 10 days.</li>
 	<li>Testing prior to and during treatment: Perform eGFR, hepatic laboratory, and prothrombin time testing prior to initiating Veklury and during use as clinically appropriate.</li>

<strong>Phase 1/2 Dose Expansion Studies in Recurrent Glioblastoma and Pancreatic Cancer Completed; Results to be Reported at Key Medical Meetings During Q4 2021</strong>

<strong>Company Plans to Initiate Global Phase 2/3 Registration Study for VT1021 in Glioblastoma by the End of 2021</strong>

<strong>Cambridge MA – September 21, 2021 (PR Newswire)</strong> – Vigeo Therapeutics, a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company pioneering novel cancer therapies, today announced completion of the Phase 1/2 dose expansion studies evaluating its lead asset VT1021 in recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) and pancreatic cancer.

VT1021 is a first-in-class, dual-modulating compound that both blocks the CD47 immune checkpoint and reprograms the CD36 receptor to induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis. In the completed open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 study (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03364400?term=NCT03364400&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1"">NCT03364400</a>), the safety and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of single-agent VT1021 was evaluated in subjects enrolled in both dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts. The escalation cohort included all-comers, and the expansion cohorts focused on rGBM and pancreatic cancer, among other indications.

<strong>Phase 1/2 Results in Recurrent Glioblastoma and Pancreatic Cancer</strong>

In the rGBM expansion cohort, single-agent VT1021 demonstrated complete tumor regression in multiple subjects and partial response in other subjects, with multiple subjects remaining on trial for well over 9 months. While the expansion study has concluded, these subjects will continue to receive VT1021 in an open label extension study.

In the pancreatic cancer expansion cohort, single-agent VT1021 demonstrated tumor reduction in multiple subjects with measurable disease. Moreover, VT1021 was able to reprogram the tumor immune microenvironment from immune-suppressive to immune-responsive.

Vigeo plans to present the results of both of these studies at medical meetings during the fourth quarter of 2021. The company is expected to initiate a global, Phase 2/3 registration study evaluating VT1021 in newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM patients by the end of 2021. In parallel, Vigeo plans to initiate efficacy studies in additional solid tumor indications, including pancreatic cancer, during the first half of 2022.

Jim Mahoney, Chief Executive Officer of Vigeo, commented, “VT1021 is a first-in-class anti-cancer agent that works by stimulating the expression of Tsp-1 which then binds with high affinity to CD47, blocking the “do not eat me” signal, and to CD36, which leads to a cascade of beneficial changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) that further enhance anti-tumor effects. We, along with the PI’s who conducted the trials, are very excited by what we have observed to date in the two expansion studies.”

Mr. Mahoney was appointed Chief Executive Officer in February of this year. Jing Watnick, PhD, MBA, Vigeo founder and previous CEO, is remaining on as the COO and will focus her efforts on developing the clinical and preclinical assets.

Prior to joining Vigeo as CEO, Mr. Mahoney served as a member of the Vigeo Board of Directors since 2015. In his new role, Mr. Mahoney will lead the development of Vigeo’s corporate strategy and will drive a disciplined growth strategy as Vigeo executes on its clinical programs.

Mr. Mahoney has over 30 years of senior executive experience at various biotechnology, healthcare and specialty chemicals companies. Most recently, he was an Operating Partner at Ara Partners, a private equity investment firm. Prior to that he served as CEO and President at Novomer Inc., Surface Logix Inc., and Prolinx Inc. and was a founding senior executive at Dade Behring Inc. Earlier, he held executive positions at Baxter International and FMC Corporation. Mr. Mahoney received his BS degree from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and holds an MBA from Northwestern University’s J.L. Kellogg School of Management and an MMA in international economics from the University of Southern California.

<strong>About VT1021?</strong>
Vigeo’s lead asset, VT1021, is a first-in-class dual modulating compound that blocks the CD47 immune checkpoint and activates CD36, which induces apoptosis and increases the M1:M2 macrophage ratio. VT1021 achieves this through stimulation of thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1). The goal of these dual-modulating effects is conversion of immuno-suppressive, or “cold,” tumors that don’t respond to immuno-oncology agents, to immuno-stimulated, or “hot,” tumors that are potentially more receptive to immuno-oncology agents. Vigeo is developing VT1021 as a therapeutic agent across a range of cancers, with a current focus on solid tumors.

<strong>About Vigeo Therapeutics</strong>
Based in Cambridge, MA, Vigeo Therapeutics is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company pioneering novel cancer therapies. The company is building a first-in-class drug development pipeline being led by VT1021, its dual-modulating compound that blocks the CD47 immune checkpoint and reprograms CD36 mediated activities. Single-agent VT1021 has been investigated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors, and is currently progressing to late-stage clinical development.

Basel, 24 September 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced data from across its growing neuromuscular portfolio at the World Muscle Society (WMS) Virtual Congress 20 – 24 September 2021. The presentations included additional results from the RAINBOWFISH study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of Evrysdi® (risdiplam) in babies with pre-symptomatic spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) from birth to six weeks of age and data supporting the continued clinical investigation of gene therapy, SRP-9001, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

“These new data for Evrysdi may help extend the potential benefits of this medicine to the youngest SMA patients. Also, the data from SRP-9001 have helped to optimise the design of the upcoming Phase III trial for DMD,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Our goal is to continue to lead the way in developing transformative medicines for neuromuscular diseases. We are grateful for the partnerships that are helping us to develop new therapies for people impacted by these devastating rare diseases.”

At WMS 2021, data from the ongoing open label RAINBOWFISH study were presented. Four out of five of those treated with Evrysdi for at least 12 months achieved standing and walking independently within the World Health Organization windows for healthy children. In addition, all five babies maintained the ability to swallow and were able to feed exclusively orally after 12 months of treatment.

Previously reported results showed that babies treated with Evrysdi for at least 12 months achieved Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE-2) motor milestones, with 100% (n=5) able to maintain head control, sitting upright, rolling and crawling.

These data further add to the growing body of evidence supporting Evrysdi’s efficacy in a broad patient population. More than 4,000 patients have been treated with Evrysdi in clinical trials, compassionate use, and real-world settings.

In DMD, three-year data from the open-label trial, Study SRP-9001-101, evaluating the safety of a single dose of the investigational gene therapy SRP-9001 in four ambulatory children aged 4 and 7 years old with DMD, were presented. The study showed that SRP-9001 was well-tolerated with key functional assessment, measured by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), demonstrating an overall improvement in motor ability compared to baseline. The improvements in motor abilities were maintained over three years, signifying a durable response. The results support the continuation of clinical investigation to further assess the benefit/risk of SRP-9001 in patients with DMD.

Roche, and partner Sarepta, also shared data from ENDEAVOR (Study SRP-9001-103), the first clinical trial using commercially representative SRP-9001 material for the treatment of DMD. Interim results from the first 11 participants in Cohort 1 (ambulatory boys aged 4-7 years) from the open label, ongoing Phase 1b study, provides evidence that SRP-9001 showed robust expression of micro-dystrophin and no new safety signals were identified.

In addition, results from Part 1 of Study SRP-9001-102, an ongoing, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of a single dose of SRP-9001 in 41 boys with DMD, showed that the study met its primary biological endpoint of change in micro-dystrophin protein expression from baseline. Participants treated with SRP-9001, generally showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks, although this increase did not achieve statistical significance compared to that of patients who received placebo. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies, with no new safety signals identified.

The results of these studies provide important information for SRP-9001’s ongoing clinical development programme, with outcomes from Study 101 and 102 informing the design of the Phase 3 trial for SRP-9001, due to commence globally by the end of the year.

<strong>About </strong><strong>Evrysdi</strong><strong>® (</strong><strong>risdiplam</strong><strong>)</strong>
Evrysdi is a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier designed to treat SMA by increasing production of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement. Evrysdi is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or by feeding tube.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA in adults and children 2 months of age and older. Evrysdi was granted PRIME designation by the EMA in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by FDA and EMA in 2017 and 2019, respectively. At this time, Evrysdi has been approved in over 50 countries including the US and Europe and submitted in more than 30 countries.

<strong>About SMA</strong>
SMA is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It affects approximately one in 10,000 babies and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by a mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leads to a deficiency of SMN protein. This protein is found throughout the body and is essential to the function of nerves that control muscles and movement.

Without it, nerve cells cannot function correctly, leading to muscle weakness over time. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

<strong>About SRP-9001</strong>
SRP-9001 (rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin) is an investigational gene therapy designed to deliver the micro-dystrophin-encoding gene directly to the skeletal and cardiac muscle for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein to enable a durable clinical response. Sarepta Therapeutics is responsible for global development and manufacturing for SRP-9001 and plans to commercialize SRP-9001 in the United States upon receiving FDA approval. In December 2019, Roche partnered with Sarepta to combine Roche’s global reach, commercial presence, and regulatory expertise to accelerate access to SRP-9001 for patients outside the United States.

<strong>About DMD</strong>
DMD is a rare X-linked, progressive neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene that disrupts the production of functional dystrophin protein, leading to a loss of muscle function and premature death. DMD is one of the most common fatal genetic disorders, affecting approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 male births worldwide.

Symptoms usually appear in infants and toddlers, with affected children presenting developmental delays such as difficulty walking, climbing stairs or standing from a sitting position. As DMD progresses, muscle weakness involves the arms, trunk, and other areas, meaning patients often require full-time use of a wheelchair in their early teens. Longevity is limited due to cardiac and/or respiratory failure.

AstraZeneca has reached an agreement to collaborate with VaxEquity for the discovery, development and commercialisastion of the proprietary self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) therapeutics platform developed at Imperial College London.

The strategic, long-term research collaboration aims to optimise and validate VaxEquity’s saRNA platform and apply it to advance novel therapeutic programmes. AstraZeneca will support VaxEquity with research and development funding and should AstraZeneca advance any of the research programmes into its pipeline, VaxEquity could receive development, approval and sales based milestones totalling up to $195 million and royalties in the mid-single digits per programme. AstraZeneca has the option to collaborate with VaxEquity on up to 26 drug targets and will also make an investment in VaxEquity to further the development of the saRNA platform.

VaxEquity was founded by Imperial College London and Morningside in 2020 based on the innovative saRNA technology developed by Professor Robin Shattock and his colleagues at Imperial College London, UK.

saRNA is a new platform for the development of medicines and vaccines which uses similar technology to mRNA but with the added ability to self-amplify, thereby expressing proteins for longer, resulting in higher protein levels per dose level. This has the potential to allow saRNAs to be delivered at lower concentrations than conventional mRNA therapeutics, leading to less frequent or lower dosing, lower costs and a much broader range of potential applications. The saRNA platform aims to underpin the next generation of RNA-delivered medicines enabling not only vaccines but also broad range of therapeutic applications.

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said “This collaboration with VaxEquity adds a promising new platform to our drug discovery toolbox. We believe self-amplifying RNA, once optimised, will allow us to target novel pathways not amenable to traditional drug discovery across our therapy areas of interest.”

Michael Watson, Executive Chairman of VaxEquity, said, “We are delighted to collaborate with AstraZeneca given its strong track record in innovation and welcome them as a new investor. We are also grateful for the ongoing support of our existing investor, Morningside Group. With our self-amplifying RNA platform, we aim to underpin the next generation of RNA-delivered medicines enabling not only vaccines but also broad range of therapeutics applications.”

<span id=""spanHghlt6fb7""><span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span> and</span> SUZHOU, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 23, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Group. (""Innovent"") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that the first patient with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis has been successfully dosed in a Phase 2 clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT05003531) of recombinant anti-interleukin 23p19 subunit antibody injection (R &amp; D code: IBI112) in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.

Study CIBI112A201 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of IBI112 at different doses administered subcutaneously in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous injection of IBI112 at different doses in Chinese subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The safety of drugs and the difference of administration interval between different therapeutic regimens will also be investigated, so as to provide dose information for Phase 3 clinical studies. This is also the first Phase 2 clinical study of domestic innovative drugs targeting IL-23p19, which is a significant milestone.

Professor <span class=""xn-person"">Jianzhong Zhang</span> from Peking University People's Hospital, principal investigator of the study, stated, ""The pathogenesis of psoriasis is complex. Psoriasis is difficult to treat, and the patients often suffer for a lifetime. Currently about 2% to 3% of the world's population suffers from psoriasis; about 80% to 90% of patients have plaque psoriasis, and nearly one third of the cases are moderate to severe. There are about 6 million patients with psoriasis in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. According to the literature, IL-23 monoclonal antibody has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its favorable efficacy and safety profiles. IBI112 is a novel IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody independently investigated and developed by Chinese enterprises. The results of Phase 1 clinical trial showed favorable safety and tolerability as well as potential advantages in the route of administration. We hope that IBI112 will be successful in the Phase 2 clinical trial, and provide an alternative treatment option for Chinese patients with psoriasis.""

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Qian Lei</span>, Executive Director of Medical Sciences and Strategies of Special Diseases of Innovent, stated: ""With the introduction of biologics drugs such as adalimumab and IL-17 into the clinic, compared with traditional systemic treatments, they undoubtedly offer alternative treatment options for patients with psoriasis, but there is still room for further improvement in terms of efficacy, safety, as well as maintaining a durable effect. Recently, a new generation of drugs targeting IL-23 has attracted special interests due to its excellent efficacy and favorable safety profile. IL-23 plays a key role in T cell-mediated response and is regarded as a pivotal initiator of immune-mediated diseases. In contrast to IL-17 monoclonal antibody, antibodies against IL23p19 have significant advantages in terms of generating a durable effect. IBI112 plays an anti-inflammatory role by blocking IL-23-mediated signaling pathway and has the potential to treat autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD). Currently, there is no self-developed IL-23p19 inhibitors on the market in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. Results from the first-in-human Phase 1 clinical study of IBI112 has confirmed its favorable safety and tolerability profiles, and has preliminarily demonstrated its potential to serve a more patient-friendly treatment regimen. We are greatly encouraged that it can provide strong foundation for the subsequent clinical development. Based on this, in collaboration with our study sites, we are confident to advance the clinical development of IBI112 in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as well as other indications to fulfill our mission of providing high-quality innovative biopharmaceuticals that are accessible to the vast majority of patients.""

<b>About IBI112</b>

IBI112 is a monoclonal antibody independently developed by Innovent, with independent intellectual property rights. This product specifically binds to IL-23p19 subunit, thereby preventing IL-23 from binding to cell surface receptors, resulting in the inhibition of IL-23 receptor-mediated signaling pathway. Preclinical data demonstrated that IBI 112 has a, clear target and well-elucidated mechanism of action, and significant anti-inflammatory effect, suggesting that it may provide a more effective treatment option for patients with psoriasis or other autoimmune diseases.

<b>About Psoriasis</b>

Psoriasis is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory and systemic disease mediated by both genetic and environmental factors, which can occur in all age groups with no gender preference . The typical clinical presentation includes scaly erythema or plaque with localized or widespread distribution. It is, a lifetime long noninfectious condition, which is very difficult to treat. Psoriasis can be classified into psoriasis vulgaris (including guttate psoriasis and plaque psoriasis), pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis and arthropathic psoriasis. Approximately, 80 ~ 90% of patients have plaque psoriasis, and nearly 30% of the cases are moderate and severe. There are significant differences in the prevalence of psoriasis around the world, with more than 6 million patients in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. At present, in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, the main systemic treatments include methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine A, retinoic acids and biological agents. Since 2019, psoriasis treatment in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> has gradually entered the era of biological agents.

NEW YORK &amp; MAINZ, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for emergency use a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for individuals 65 years of age and older, individuals 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19, and individuals 18 through 64 years of age whose frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 puts them at high risk of serious complications of COVID-19 including severe COVID-19. The booster dose is to be administered at least six months after completion of the primary series, and is the same formulation and dosage strength as the doses in the primary series.

“This first FDA authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine booster is a critical milestone in the ongoing fight against this disease,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “Over the last year and a half, we have aimed to stay vigilant as the pandemic has evolved – including evaluating the impact of a booster dose. We believe boosters have an important role to play in addressing the continued threat of this disease, alongside efforts to increase global access and uptake among the unvaccinated. Today’s FDA action is an important step in helping the most vulnerable among us remain protected from COVID-19.”

“Today’s emergency use authorization is supported by clinical data underlining that a booster induces a strong immune response against tested variants of concern and can address a current public health need. We will continue to monitor new SARS-CoV-2 strains, to be prepared for potential emerging escape variants,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “We and our collaboration partner have submitted booster data to other regulatory agencies around the world. We are simultaneously working to expand access to our vaccines globally.”

The FDA based this EUA on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the companies and <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Ffda-advisory-committee-votes-unanimously-favor-comirnatyr&amp;esheet=52496440&amp;newsitemid=20210922006046&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=reviewed+by+the+FDA%26%238217%3Bs+Vaccines+and+Related+Biological+Products+Advisory+Committee+%28VRBPAC%29&amp;index=1&amp;md5=cc6a5f66190a161d61c0ac347c5b889a"" rel=""nofollow"">reviewed by the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC)</a>,<b></b>including data from the Pfizer-BioNTech clinical program evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. A booster dose of the vaccine elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the initial SARS-CoV-2 virus (wild type), as well as the Beta and Delta variants, when compared with the levels observed after the two-dose primary series. The reactogenicity profile within seven days after the booster dose was typically mild to moderate, and the frequency of reactions was similar to or lower than after dose two. The adverse event profile was generally consistent with other clinical safety data for the vaccine.

As a next step, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet to discuss a potential recommendation for the use and rollout of boosters to Americans.

Pfizer and BioNTech continue to supply the vaccine, including sufficient volume for boosters, under their existing supply agreement with the U.S. government, which continues through April 2022. The companies do not expect the introduction of booster doses in the U.S. to impact the existing supply agreements in place with governments and international health organizations around the world. Pfizer and BioNTech have pledged to provide two billion doses to low- and middle-income countries in 2021 and 2022 – at least one billion doses each year.

Under the EUA in the U.S., a third dose of the vaccine was <a class=""ext"" href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fnews-events%2Fpress-announcements%2Fcoronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-vaccine-dose-certain-immunocompromised&amp;esheet=52496440&amp;newsitemid=20210922006046&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=previously+authorized&amp;index=2&amp;md5=d77d3cdcea7e0532791c5eb5bb3dfd62"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-extlink="""">previously authorized</a> for individuals at least 12 years of age who have undergone solid organ transplant, or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise. This authorization of a third dose for immunocompromised individuals – administered at least 28 days following the second dose – is separate and distinct from the booster dose authorized today. The third dose for immunocompromised individuals is meant to address the fact that these individuals sometimes do not build enough protection after two doses of the vaccine. In contrast, the booster dose authorized today refers to an additional dose of the vaccine that is given to those who have built enough protection after the primary vaccination series, but may have decreased protection over time due to waning of immunity.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned.

<b>Pfizer Disclosure Notice</b>

The information contained in this release is as of September 22, 2021. Pfizer assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or developments.

This release contains forward-looking information about Pfizer’s efforts to combat COVID-19, the collaboration between BioNTech and Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (BNT162b2) (including a potential booster dose and emergency use authorization in the U.S. of a booster dose for individuals 65 years of age and older, individuals 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19, and individuals 18 through 64 years of age whose frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 puts them at high risk of serious complications of COVID-19 including severe COVID-19; qualitative assessments of available data; potential benefits; expectations for clinical trials; the anticipated timing of data readouts; regulatory submissions; regulatory approvals or authorizations; and anticipated manufacturing, distribution and supply) involving substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with preclinical and clinical data (including the Phase 3 data), including the possibility of unfavorable new preclinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing preclinical, clinical or safety data; whether and when our Phase 3 clinical trial will demonstrate protection from infection or disease following a booster dose, which is the subject of ongoing study; the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results, including the rate of vaccine effectiveness and safety and tolerability profile observed to date, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial and additional studies or in larger, more diverse populations following commercialization; the ability of BNT162b2 to prevent COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants; the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine will lead to new information about efficacy, safety, or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious; the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and with what modifications and interpretations; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future preclinical and clinical studies; whether and when applications for a potential booster dose will be filed in any other jurisdictions, whether and when data from BNT162b2 in younger pediatric populations will be submitted to the FDA and other regulatory authorities to request amendments to emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations and whether and when other biologics license and/or emergency use authorization applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for BNT162b2 or any other potential vaccines that may arise from the BNT162 program, and if obtained, whether or when such emergency use authorization or licenses will expire or terminate; whether and when any applications that may be pending or filed for BNT162b2 (including potential amendments to request use in younger pediatric populations, a potential booster dose or any other requested amendments to the emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations) or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine’s efficacy and, if approved, whether it will be commercially successful; decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of a vaccine, including development of products or therapies by other companies; disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners, clinical trial sites or third-party suppliers; the risk that demand for any products may be reduced or no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture a vaccine; challenges related to our vaccine’s ultra-low temperature formulation, two-dose schedule and attendant storage, distribution and administration requirements, including risks related to storage and handling after delivery by Pfizer; the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations, booster doses or new variant-specific vaccines; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or maintain access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our vaccine, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods as previously indicated; whether and when additional supply agreements will be reached; uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations; challenges related to public vaccine confidence or awareness; uncertainties regarding the impact of COVID-19 on Pfizer’s business, operations and financial results; and competitive developments.

A further description of risks and uncertainties can be found in Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and in its subsequent reports on Form 10-Q, including in the sections thereof captioned “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results”, as well as in its subsequent reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and available at <a class=""ext"" href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globenewswire.com%2FTracker%3Fdata%3DRnYjuX1qNnk63wnFRI2njqkWCUtSvj6x_99MqPLwYIXuudw4effilg2LyEquwqm-7QGJ6tM6dhKt8Yb6iY-5gw%3D%3D&amp;esheet=52496440&amp;newsitemid=20210922006046&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;index=16&amp;md5=974d2eeed06991a629c816a2f9996c78"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-extlink="""">www.sec.gov</a> and <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globenewswire.com%2FTracker%3Fdata%3DRnYjuX1qNnk63wnFRI2njhMtuWVC6S5kOg8JnuFHwPyIzH1O7AiSzrr-wECJd2hrMZ7668ALHee8mVEXVNXWFA%3D%3D&amp;esheet=52496440&amp;newsitemid=20210922006046&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.pfizer.com&amp;index=17&amp;md5=1e29ebd9f9b22ac705bfa11d61812454"" rel=""nofollow"">www.pfizer.com</a>.

<a><strong>BOSTON – September 23, 2021 – </strong></a>GE (NYSE:GE) has entered into an agreement to acquire BK Medical, a leader in advanced surgical visualization, from Altaris Capital Partners for a cash purchase price of $1.45 billion.

BK Medical is an innovator in global intraoperative imaging and surgical navigation, used to guide clinicians during minimally invasive and robotic surgeries and to visualize deep tissue during procedures in neuro and abdominal surgery, and in ultrasound urology. <a>BK Medical is</a> headquartered in Boston and Copenhagen with more than 650 employees and is delivering double-digit revenue growth.

GE Healthcare President and CEO Kieran Murphy said, “Ultrasound today forms an integral part of many care pathways, and BK Medical is a strategic and highly complementary addition to our growing and profitable Ultrasound business. <a>This transaction helps GE Healthcare continue to expand beyond diagnostics into surgical and therapeutic interventions, simplifying decision-making for clinicians and equipping them with greater insights to deliver faster, more personalized care for their patients—representing another step toward delivering precision health.”</a>

BK Medical President and CEO Brooks West said, “We are immensely proud of the organization and of the life-changing technology that we have built at BK Medical, and look forward to our future as part of the GE Healthcare family. Combining our expertise in intraoperative imaging and surgical navigation with GE Healthcare’s many strengths and global presence will accelerate our mission to change the standard of care in surgical interventions. Our mission to help surgeons make critical decisions using active imaging aligns well with GE Healthcare’s mission to help physicians make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes, and we are eager to begin this new chapter.”

GE Healthcare Ultrasound President and CEO Roland Rott said, “Adding the fast-growing and relatively new field of real-time surgical visualization to GE’s pre- and post-operative Ultrasound capabilities will create an end-to-end offering through the full continuum of care—from diagnosis through therapy and beyond. GE Healthcare and BK Medical share a passion for clinical innovation, and I’m excited to welcome BK Medical to our team.”

This transaction is expected to create value by further strengthening BK Medical, including through significant synergies with the benefit of GE’s technology and commercial scale. This transaction enables BK Medical’s Active Imaging platform to reach new customers and new markets around the world, and the combination of GE Healthcare’s diagnostic imaging technology with BK’s ability to enable decision-making and surgical visualization in intervention will allow better decision-making throughout the care continuum. GE Healthcare expects BK Medical to deliver rapid revenue growth as well as margin expansion and free cash flow growth. GE Healthcare also expects high-single-digit return on invested capital by year five.

The parties expect the transaction to close in 2022, subject to review by the relevant regulatory authorities.

Evercore acted as exclusive financial advisor to GE on the transaction. Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher acted as legal advisor to GE. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC served as lead financial advisor, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC served as financial advisor, and Latham Watkins LLP and Schiff Hardin LLP acted as legal advisor to BK Medical.

<span class=""xn-location"">SHANGHAI</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 24, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <a href=""http://www.everestmedicines.com/Default.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Everest Medicines</a> (HKEX 1952.HK), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing transformative pharmaceutical products that address critical unmet medical needs for patients in <span class=""xn-location"">Asia</span>, announced today that the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of <span class=""xn-location"">the People's Republic of China</span> has approved the investigational new drug (IND) application under Class One category for SPR206 (also known as EVER206), a novel, intravenous next-generation polymyxin product candidate in development for the treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacterial infections.

""The emergence of antibiotic drug resistance and hospital-acquired infection caused by it are a significant global health issue and are also an area of critical and growing concern globally over last decades,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Sunny Xu Zhu</span>, Chief Medical Officer for Infectious Disease at Everest Medicines. ""To combat this issue, Everest is developing and locally manufacturing a novel antibiotic to address infections caused by drug-resistant microorganisms. We are pleased with the IND approval of SPR206 as a Class One innovative drug, which underscores the initiation of independent development of SPR206 led by Everest in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> and marks an important milestone for this potentially best-in-class innovative polymyxin antibacterial drug. The IND approval allows Everest Medicines to initiate the clinical development of SPR206 in its territory and fulfill the goal of providing new weapons for physicians in the future to address this critical unmet clinical need.""

""The manufacture of SPR206 drug substance (DS) and drug product (DP) for the China Phase 1 clinical trial were completed in five months domestically, which demonstrates our commitment to evolve Everest into a fully integrated pharmaceutical company,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Steven Hu</span>, PhD, Chief Technology Officer of Everest Medicines. ""We will continue to support the future development of SPR206 through a local manufacturing pathway to accelerate the drug development process.""

Spero Therapeutics previously reported data from its first Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial of SPR206 suggesting that SPR206 is well-tolerated, with no evidence of nephrotoxicity at doses within the anticipated therapeutic range for MDR gram-negative bacterial infections. In <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2021</span>, Spero initiated two Phase 1 trials of SPR206, to assess the intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics after intravenous infusion of SPR206 in healthy subjects, as well as the safety and pharmacokinetics in subjects with different renal function after intravenous infusion of SPR206. Data from both clinical trials are expected by early 2022. Everest will start the planned clinical program in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> shortly and expect Phase 1 study results in 2022.

<b>About SPR206</b>

SPR206 is a potentially best-in-class, novel polymyxin derivative that was designed to reduce the toxicity, especially nephrotoxicity, compared to that observed clinically with polymyxin B and colistin. Polymyxins are antibiotics frequently used as a last resort for challenging MDR gram-negative infections, but they are associated with significant neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. A series of animal studies, in vitro studies and studies in healthy subjects have been completed to-date that demonstrate a favorable safety profile for SPR206 and in-vitro and in-vivo studies indicate the antibacterial activity of SPR206 is similar or superior to polymyxin B or colistin.

Under an earlier licensing agreement with Spero, Everest Medicines has exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPR206 in <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">South Korea</span> and certain Southeast Asian countries (the ""Territory"") for the treatment of MDR gram-negative bacterial infections. Spero has granted Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/everest-medicines-announces-approval-of-investigational-new-drug-application-by-china-nmpa-for-spr206-301384591.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">PFE</a>) the rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SPR206 in ex-U.S. and ex-<span class=""xn-location"">Asia</span> territories in <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2021</span>.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Sept. 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Repatha<sup>®</sup> (evolocumab) as an adjunct to diet and other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapies for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) to reduce LDL-C.

HeFH is an inherited, genetic condition with a prevalence of one in 250 people worldwide.<sup>1</sup> High levels of LDL-C starting at birth accelerate the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, leading to an overall increased risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attack and other vascular conditions, at an earlier age.<sup>2</sup> Children with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) can be normal weight, have a good diet, exercise enough and still have high LDL-C.<sup>2,3</sup>

""The approval of Repatha for pediatric patients with FH represents a much-needed adjunct treatment option for these children with genetically high cholesterol who are unable to manage their high LDL-C with other lipid-lowering agents alone,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""This milestone further reinforces the safety profile of Repatha and aligns with Amgen's commitment to addressing the unmet needs of the high-risk cardiovascular community.""

The approval is based on the HAUSER-RCT Phase 3b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Repatha in pediatric patients, 10 - 17 years of age, with HeFH. Monthly treatment with Repatha reduced LDL-C by mean 38% (95% CI: 45%, 31%; p &lt; 0.0001) from baseline compared to placebo, meeting its primary endpoint.<sup>4</sup> Reductions in LDL-C were observed by the first post-baseline assessment at the Week 12 time point and were maintained throughout the trial.<sup>4</sup> Patients treated with Repatha had improved secondary lipid parameters from baseline in comparison to placebo, including a 35% (CI: 42%, 28%) reduction in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) at week 24, a 27% (CI: 32%, 21%) reduction in total cholesterol at week 24 and a 32% (CI: 39%, 26%) reduction in apolipoprotein B (ApoB) at week 24.<sup>5</sup> No new safety risks were identified.<sup>5</sup> The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (&gt;5% of patients treated with Repatha and occurring more frequently than placebo) included nasopharyngitis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, influenza and upper respiratory tract infection.<sup>5</sup>

""As pediatric FH is an under-recognized condition that can lead to premature coronary artery disease, it's critically important to have additional treatments that can significantly lower cholesterol,"" said Katherine Wilemon, founder and chief executive officer at The FH Foundation.

The FDA also approved Repatha as an adjunct to other LDL-C lowering therapies for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) for younger pediatric patients. Repatha was already approved for treatment in HoFH patients aged 13 and older and is now available as a treatment for patients aged 10 and older.

<b>About Familial Hypercholesterolemia
</b>Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is an abnormality of cholesterol and/or fats in the blood.<sup>5,6</sup> Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition that causes high levels of LDL-C at an early age<sup>7</sup>. It is estimated that 1 million people in the U.S. have FH (heterozygous and homozygous forms), yet less than 10% are diagnosed.<sup>8</sup> Heterozygous FH (HeFH) is the more common type of FH and occurs globally in approximately 1 in 250.<sup>9</sup> People with HeFH have a 50% chance of passing the condition to their children.<sup>8</sup>

<b>About HAUSER-RCT Study Design
</b>HAUSER-RCT was a Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 24 weeks of monthly subcutaneous injections of Repatha<sup>®</sup> (evolocumab) 420 mg (n = 104) versus placebo (n = 53) in patients 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesteremia, or HeFH. Randomization was stratified by LDL-C (&lt;4.1 versus =4.1 mmol/L) and age (&lt;14 versus =14 years of age) at screening. Patients were required to be on a low-fat diet and must have been receiving optimized background lipid-lowering therapy (statin at optimal dose, not requiring up titration).The primary endpoint was percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24; secondary endpoints included mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 22 and 24, change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24, percent changes from baseline to week 24 in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, and ApoB/apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) ratio. Further safety evaluations included Tanner staging, hormone levels, carotid intimal medial thickness, and computer-based cognitive assessments.

<b>About Repatha<sup>®</sup> (evolocumab)
</b>Repatha is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.<sup>11</sup>

Repatha is approved in 75 countries, including the U.S., Japan, China and in all 27 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.

<b>Indications</b>

Repatha<sup>®</sup> is indicated:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>In adults with established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization</li>
 	<li>As an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–lowering therapies, in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), to reduce LDL–C</li>
 	<li>As an adjunct to diet and other LDL-C-lowering therapies in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with HeFH, to reduce LDL-C</li>
 	<li>As an adjunct to other LDL–C-lowering therapies in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), to reduce LDL–C

<b>Amgen Forward-Looking Statements
</b>This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), or the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products.

<span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span> and SUZHOU, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 26, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, and AnHeart Therapeutics Co., Ltd (""AnHeart""), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel first-in-class or best-in-class precision oncology therapeutics, today jointly announced the interim clinical data from a Phase 2 trial (TRUST) evaluating taletrectinib (AB-106), an investigational next-generation ROS1/NTRK inhibitor in ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The data was announced as a keynote presentation at the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) 2021 Annual Meeting on <span class=""xn-chron"">September 25-29, 2021</span>.

The scientific presentation entitled: ""Taletrectinib (AB-106): Preliminary results from TRUST, Phase 2 trial of a new generation of potent ROS1/NTRK inhibitors in ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),"" summarized preliminary data from an ongoing Phase 2 trial of taletrectinib (NCT04395677).

As of <span class=""xn-chron"">June 16, 2021</span>, 21 crizotinib treatment-naïve patients and 16 crizotinib pre-treated patients were confirmed to be ROS1 <span id=""spanHghlt44f9"">fusion-positive. The</span> key results are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>In the crizotinib treatment-naïve patient group (n=21), the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 90.5% (19/21) and the disease control rate (DCR) was 90.5% (19/21).</li>
 	<li>In the crizotinib pre-treated patient group (n=16), the confirmed ORR was 43.8% (7/16); and the DCR was 75.0% (12/16).</li>
 	<li>Among the crizotinib pre-treated patient group (n=16), ROS1 G2032R resistant mutations were identified in three patients and all three patients experienced tumor regression, 2 patients reported a partial response (PR), and 1 patient stable disease (SD).</li>
 	<li>In patients with assessable brain metastasis pre-enrollment, intracranial objective response rate (assessed by investigator) was 83.3% (5/6).</li>
 	<li>Taletrectinib was well-tolerated and treatment-related adverse events primarily included gastrointestinal adverse events and reversible aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased.</li>
</ul>
Dr. Caicun Zhou, Director of the Department of Oncology in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, stated:""We are pleased with the interim Phase 2 data, which have shown taletrectinib to be safe and tolerable, a very promising novel therapy for patients with ROS1 fusion positive lung cancer. Responses appear particularly impressive in crizotinib treatment-naïve patients, and while the number of crizotinib pre-treated patients is limited, so far, most patients continue to show benefit from the drug.""

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Hui Zhou</span>, Senior Vice President of Innovent, stated: ""We are glad to see the interim Phase 2 data of taletrectinib presented at the CSCO meeting, one of the most authoritative clinical oncology conferences in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, ROS1-positive patients currently have limited treatment options. Novel therapies are urgently needed, and taletrectinib has good efficacy and safety results, which offers hope to patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC.""

Bing Yan, MD, Co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of AnHeart Therapeutics, stated: ""Our team is focused on completing patient enrollment for our Phase 2 TRUST trial. The interim data presented builds a strong foundation for our ongoing global pivotal taletrectinib clinical program. We sincerely thank the patients, their families and investigators in the TRUST trial and look forward to advancing development of taletrectinib for all ROS1 fusion positive patients with NSCLC, an area of significant unmet medical needs.""

<b>About Taletrectinib</b>

Taletrectinib is an investigational next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) designed to effectively target ROS1 and NTRK fusion mutations with potential to treat TKI-naïve or pre-treated patients. ROS1 rearrangement is estimated to be an oncogenic driver in approximately 2 to 3 percent of patients with advanced NSCLC, and NTRK rearrangement is estimated to be an oncogenic driver in approximately 0.5 percent of patients with other advanced solid tumors.

<strong>Ingelheim, Germany, September 15, 2021</strong> – Boehringer Ingelheim, a global leader in animal health, announces positive opinion for the combined use of Ingelvac CircoFLEX<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup> and Ingelvac PRRSFLEX EU<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup>, received in the European Union. The combined administration of both vaccines represents innovation in pig health management. From now on, two of the most prominent and costly diseases, Porcine Circovirus Disease (PCVD) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), can be prevented with a single injection. In modern pig production most pigs receive vaccines to protect against these two diseases.

It is globally the first and only product of its kind.<sup>1</sup> With this freshly mixed combination of vaccines, vaccination schedules can be better targeted to specific epidemiological disease situations. This innovation can also help enhance and improve animal welfare as well as overall animal husbandry by reducing vaccination stress and animal handling. The freshly mixed use of Ingelvac CircoFLEX<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup> and Ingelvac<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup> PRRS MLV is already registered in the US under the tradename FLEX CircoPRRS<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup>.

“We are very proud that we can now also supply veterinarians and pig producers with the latest innovation: the simultaneous use of Ingelvac CircoFLEX<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup> and our PRRS vaccines. It will help them tremendously in reducing the number of injections to pigs, in supporting well-being of their animals and the farm economics by saving on costly labor,” comments Eva Joras, Global Brand Manager FLEX vaccines at Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health.

“FLEX CircoPRRS<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup>, together with the FreVAX<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup> needle free smart vaccination device launched this year, is another innovation that improves the lives of the pigs under our care, whilst enhancing the vaccination process for vets and producers,” concludes Dr Markus Hammer, Global Head of Swine, Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health.

TOKYO &amp; BOTHELL, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE:4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) and Seagen Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced that Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved PADCEV<sup>®</sup><i></i>(enfortumab vedotin) for radically unresectable urothelial carcinoma that has progressed after anti-cancer chemotherapy. The New Drug Application received priority review.

Radically unresectable urothelial carcinoma is urothelial cancer that cannot be treated by surgical removal of the urinary bladder or the kidney and the ureter due to tumor growth.

“Unfortunately, advanced urothelial cancer has a relatively poor prognosis and can be challenging to treat with currently available therapies,” said Andrew Krivoshik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Development Therapeutic Areas, Astellas. “The MHLW’s review of enfortumab vedotin in just six months, supported by overall survival data from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, reflects the seriousness of this condition and the potential benefit of enfortumab vedotin for patients in Japan.”

The approval is primarily based on the global Phase 3 EV-301 clinical trial, which included sites in Japan. The trial evaluated enfortumab vedotin versus chemotherapy in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1/L1 inhibitor. At the time of pre-specified interim analysis, patients who received enfortumab vedotin (n=301) in the trial lived a median of 3.9 months longer than those who received chemotherapy (n=307). Median overall survival was 12.9 vs. 9.0 months, respectively [Hazard Ratio=0.70 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.56, 0.89), p=0.001]. The most common (=20%) adverse reactions included alopecia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, pruritus, fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dysgeusia and nausea.

Each year in Japan, more than 24,300 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer and an estimated 9,500 die from the disease.<sup>1</sup> Enfortumab vedotin is the subject of a robust clinical development program aimed at addressing unmet needs across the continuum of urothelial cancer and in other solid tumors.

<b>About Urothelial Cancer
</b>Urothelial cancer is the most common type of bladder cancer (90 percent of cases), and can also be found in the renal pelvis (where urine collects inside the kidney), ureter (tube that connects the kidneys to the bladder) and urethra. Globally, approximately 573,000 new cases of bladder cancer and 212,000 deaths are reported annually.<sup>2</sup>

<b>About the EV-301 Trial
</b>The EV-301 trial (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03474107%3Fterm%3Dev-301%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&amp;esheet=52497620&amp;newsitemid=20210927005268&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT03474107&amp;index=1&amp;md5=e8492a277e6c065a0ea40f715ca0f00f"" rel=""nofollow"">NCT03474107</a>) was a global, multicenter, open-label, randomized Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate enfortumab vedotin versus physician's choice of chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine) in 608 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and platinum-based therapies. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall response rate, duration of response and disease control rate, as well as assessment of safety/tolerability and quality-of-life parameters. Results were published in the <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2035807&amp;esheet=52497620&amp;newsitemid=20210927005268&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=New+England+Journal+of+Medicine&amp;index=2&amp;md5=cf3677061434f1e6608af48a1a86707d"" rel=""nofollow""><i>New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>.

<b>About Enfortumab Vedotin
</b>Enfortumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is directed against Nectin-4, a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer.<sup>3,4</sup> Nonclinical data suggest the anticancer activity of enfortumab vedotin is due to its binding to Nectin-4 expressing cells followed by the internalization and release of the anti-tumor agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) into the cell, which result in the cell not reproducing (cell cycle arrest) and in programmed cell death (apoptosis).<sup>4 </sup>PADCEV is co-developed by Astellas and Seagen.

Alofisel (darvadstrocel) is the first expanded human allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy to be approved in Japan
- Alofisel provides a potential cell-mediated closure option for patients with complex perianal fistulas associated with Crohn’s disease who have shown an inadequate response to at least one existing medicinal treatment<sup>1,2,3</sup>

</div>
<div class=""mainBody"">

<strong>Osaka, Jap</strong><strong>an, </strong><strong>September</strong> <strong>27</strong> – <strong>Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited</strong> (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that it has received approval from the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare to manufacture and market Alofisel (darvadstrocel) - development code: Cx601 - for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in patients with non-active or mildly active luminal Crohn’s disease (CD).<sup>3</sup> This product is indicated for the treatment of patients who have shown an inadequate response to at least one existing medicinal treatment.<sup>3

</sup>CD is a chronic inflammatory disease of the digestive system,<sup>4</sup> which affects an estimated 70,700 people in Japan.<sup>5</sup> People living with CD may experience complex perianal fistulas, which can cause intense pain, bleeding, swelling, infection, and anal discharge.<sup>6</sup> Despite medical and surgical advancements, complex perianal fistulas in CD remain challenging for clinicians to treat.<sup>7</sup> In a survey commissioned and conducted by the European Federation of Crohn's &amp; Ulcerative Colitis Associations (""EFCCA""), in collaboration with Takeda, CD patients living with perianal fistulas reported a negative impact on many aspects of their quality of life, including the ability to do sports, work and employment, dating and sexual life.<sup>8</sup> Patients also reported feeling more unhygienic, uncomfortable, and guilty about their condition compared to CD patients without perianal fistulas.<sup>8</sup>

“We are delighted that Alofisel has been approved in Japan for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in Crohn’s disease patients. Complex perianal fistulas are a challenging complication of Crohn’s disease, and the approval of the first expanded human allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy in Japan offers a potential cell-mediated closure option to patients who do not respond to conventional or biologic therapies,” said Naoyoshi Hirota, General Manager of Takeda Development Center Japan.

The approval is based on data from two trials, the Japanese Study Darvadstrocel-3002 and the ADMIRE-CD trial, conducted in Europe and Israel:<sup>1,9,10</sup>
<ul>
 	<li>Study Darvadstrocel-3002 was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study investigating the efficacy (24 and 52 weeks) and safety (156 weeks) of Alofisel for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in 22 Japanese adult patients with non-active/mildly active luminal CD<sup>9,10</sup></li>
 	<li>ADMIRE-CD was a randomized, double-blind, controlled, Phase 3 trial investigating the efficacy and safety of Alofisel for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in 212 adult patients with non-active/mildly active luminal CD.<sup>1 </sup>A significantly greater proportion of patients in the Alofisel group compared to the control group achieved the primary endpoint of combined remission at a 24 week follow-up (51.5% vs 35.6%; 97.5% CI 0.5-31.2; P =0.021), and this was maintained over 52 weeks (56.3% vs 38.6%; 95% CI 4.2-31.2; P =0.01).<sup>11</sup> Alofisel treatment was well-tolerated over 52 weeks, with a similar safety profile in the Alofisel group compared to the control group<sup>11</sup></li>
</ul>
Alofisel is the first expanded human allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy to be approved in Japan. By exhibiting immunomodulatory and local anti-inflammatory effects at the site of inflammation, it offers a new treatment option with the potential of cell-mediated closure for complex perianal fistulas in patients with non-active or mildly active luminal Crohn’s disease who have shown an inadequate response to at least one existing medicinal treatment.<sup>1,2,3</sup>

It is a made to order therapy that must be administered within 72 hours of manufacture. Takeda has established a manufacturing and logistics system in Japan that enables delivery to medical institutions nationwide under strict temperature control.

<strong>About Alofisel
</strong>Alofisel is a suspension of allogeneic (or donor-derived) expanded adipose-derived stem cells (eASC) for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in adult patients with non-active or mildly active luminal CD.<sup>2</sup> Alofisel was granted orphan drug designation by the European Commission in 2009,<sup>12</sup> the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017,<sup>13</sup> and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on March 13, 2019.<sup>14</sup> Alofisel received central marketing authorization approval in the European Union in March 2018 for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in adult patients with non-active/mildly active luminal Crohn's disease, when fistulas have shown an inadequate response to at least one conventional or biologic therapy.<sup>2</sup> In 2019, darvadstrocel received a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation from the U.S. FDA for complex perianal fistulas in adults with CD.<sup>15

</sup><strong>Therapeutic Indications
</strong>Alofisel is approved in the European Union/European Economic Area, Israel, Switzerland and the United Kingdom for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in adult patients with non-active/mildly active luminal Crohn’s disease, when fistulas have shown an inadequate response to at least one conventional or biologic therapy.<sup>2</sup><sup>,16,17 </sup>Alofisel should be used only after conditioning of the fistulas.<sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>16</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>17

</sup>In Japan, Alofisel is indicated for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in patients with non-active or mildly active luminal Crohn’s disease (CD).<sup>3</sup> This product is indicated for the treatment of patients who have shown an inadequate response to at least one existing medicinal treatment.<sup>3

</sup><strong>Important Safety Information<sup>2

</sup></strong><strong>Contraindications
</strong>Hypersensitivity to the active substance, bovine serum or to any of the excipients.

<strong>Special warnings and special precautions for use
</strong>Darvadstrocel may contain trace amounts of either gentamicin or benzylpenicillin and streptomycin. This should be considered in patients with known hypersensitivity to these classes of antibiotics. Local anesthesia is not recommended due to the unknown effect of local anesthetics on the injected cells.

The injection of any substance other than sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, methylene blue, iodine solutions or hypertonic glucose solutions) through the fistula tracts is not allowed before, during, or after the injection of darvadstrocel as this may compromise cell viability.

Darvadstrocel is indicated for injection in the fistula tract tissue only. Darvadstrocel must not be administered using a needle thinner than 22G. Thinner gauge needles can cause cell disruption during injection and may compromise cell viability.

As darvadstrocel is a living stem cell therapy, it cannot be sterilized, and therefore could contain potentially infected biological material, although the risk is considered to be low and controlled in the manufacturing process. Patients should be followed up for potential signs of infection after administration.

Darvadstrocel should only be administered by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Darvadstrocel is indicated.

<strong>Fertility, Pregnancy &amp; Lactation
</strong>No data is available from the use of darvadstrocel in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Darvadstrocel is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential who are not using contraception. As a precautionary measure, darvadstrocel is not recommended for administration during breast-feeding.

<strong>Adverse reactions include: </strong>Common (=1/100 to &lt;1/10): anal abscess, proctalgia, anal fistula and procedural pain. Conditioning of fistulas has been associated with proctalgia and procedural pain.

<p style=""font-weight: 400"">WALTHAM, Mass. and WILMINGTON, Del., September 27, 2021 (PRNEWSWIRE) – Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNDX) and Incyte (Nasdaq: INCY) announced today that they have entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize axatilimab, Syndax’s anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">“This partnership has the potential to significantly expand and maximize the axatilimab program across multiple lines of treatment in chronic graft-versus-host Disease (cGVHD), as well as additional indications in which the monocyte-macrophage lineage plays a vital role in the fibrotic disease process, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),” said Briggs W. Morrison, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Syndax. “Incyte is a proven leader in the development and commercialization of many important innovative therapies, including a treatment for GVHD. We are thrilled to be working alongside this talented and determined team to combine our expertise as we strive to provide new treatment options for patients in desperate need of effective interventions.”</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">“We are excited to partner with Syndax and for the opportunity to bring another potential treatment to patients with life-threatening conditions, like GVHD,” said Hervé Hoppenot, Chief Executive Officer of Incyte. “Collaborations between companies like Incyte and Syndax, who are both dedicated to scientific advancement, contribute to the development of new innovative medicines that may benefit patient communities around the world.”</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">Syndax and Incyte are seeking to develop axatilimab as a backbone therapy for patients with cGVHD as well as in additional immune-mediated diseases where CSF-1R-dependent monocytes and macrophages are believed to contribute to organ fibrosis. Syndax recently completed a Phase 1/2 trial of axatilimab in patients with cGVHD. Data from the<a href=""https://ir.syndax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/syndax-pharmaceuticals-announces-additional-positive-data-phase""><u> Phase 1 portion of the trial</u></a> highlighting the tolerability and high response rate of axatilimab in cGVHD patients refractory to multiple therapeutic agents were reported during an oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2020. Updated results from the Phase 1 portion and preliminary results from the Phase 2 expansion portion of the study, which evaluated 1 mg/kg of axatilimab every two weeks, are expected to be presented at a medical meeting in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">Enrollment continues in the ongoing global pivotal Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial of axatilimab monotherapy in patients with cGVHD, with topline data expected in 2023. The companies also plan to initiate additional trials of axatilimab in patients with cGVHD in 2022, including a Phase 2 trial in combination with a JAK inhibitor in patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD. Beyond cGVHD, Syndax plans to commence a Phase 2 proof of concept trial of axatilimab early next year in patients with IPF, a serious, life-limiting orphan disease for which axatilimab could represent a much-needed treatment option with a novel mechanism of action.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400""><b><strong style=""font-style: inherit"">Terms of the Collaboration</strong></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">Under the terms of the agreement, Incyte will lead global commercial activities for axatilimab across all indications. The companies will participate in a 50:50 profit share in the U.S., and Syndax will receive double-digit royalties on sales outside of the U.S. Syndax will retain the option to co-promote axatilimab for any approved indications in the U.S. In connection with the agreement, Syndax will receive an upfront payment of $117 million plus a $35 million equity investment, which will be purchased at $24.62 per share, a 30% premium to the volume weighted average price over the 10 days prior to September 24, 2021. Syndax will also be eligible to receive up to an additional $450 million in potential regulatory, development and commercial milestone payments.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">The companies will share development costs associated with global and U.S.-specific trials for all agreed upon trials at a rate of 55% (Incyte) and 45% (Syndax), with Incyte responsible for 100% of future development costs for trials that are specific to ex-U.S. countries. Syndax will fund the initial development of axatilimab in IPF and Incyte will have the option to co-fund late-stage development for this indication.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">The agreement between Syndax and Incyte, including the upfront payment and equity investment, is subject to clearance by the U.S. antitrust authorities under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and will become effective as soon as these conditions have been met.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: 400""><b><strong style=""font-style: inherit"">About</strong></b><b><strong style=""font-style: inherit""> Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease</strong></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), an immune response of the donor-derived hematopoietic cells against recipient tissues, is a serious, potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) which can last for years. Chronic GVHD is estimated to develop in approximately 40% of transplant recipients, and affects approximately 14,000 patients in the U.S.<sup style=""font-style: inherit;font-weight: inherit"">1,2</sup> Chronic GVHD typically manifests across multiple organ systems, with skin and mucosa being commonly involved, and is characterized by the development of fibrotic tissue.<sup style=""font-style: inherit;font-weight: inherit"">3</sup></p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400""><b><strong style=""font-style: inherit"">About</strong></b><b><strong style=""font-style: inherit""> Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</strong></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a serious, life-limiting chronic lung disease characterized by fibrosis and scarring of lung tissue with a median survival of 3-5 years after diagnosis. Patients with IPF experience debilitating symptoms including progressive shortness of breath, particularly with exertion, chronic cough, fatigue, weakness, and chest discomfort. Currently approved drugs slow but do not halt disease progression and the only curative therapy is lung transplant, which is an option for less than 5% of patients. Estimates indicate that IPF could affect approximately 150,000 patients in the U.S. and approximately 260,000 patients across the seven major pharmaceutical markets (U.S., Japan, UK, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France).<sup style=""font-style: inherit;font-weight: inherit"">4</sup></p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400""><b><strong style=""font-style: inherit"">About Axatilimab</strong></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">Axatilimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that targets colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, or CSF-1R, a cell surface protein thought to control the survival and function of monocytes and macrophages. In pre-clinical models, inhibition of signaling through the CSF-1 receptor has been shown to reduce the number of disease-mediating macrophages along with their monocyte precursors, which has been shown to play a key role in the fibrotic disease process underlying diseases, such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Axatilimab data has demonstrated deep, durable responses and multiorgan clinical benefit in patients with cGVHD refractory to multiple therapeutic agents, and is currently being evaluated in the global pivotal Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial in patients with cGVHD. Axatilimab was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with cGVHD and IPF. Axatilimab is being developed under an exclusive worldwide license from UCB entered into between Syndax and UCB in 2016.</p>

<span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span> and SUZHOU, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> and HELLERUP, <span class=""xn-location"">Denmark</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 27, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, and UNION therapeutics A/S (UNION), a privately-held, multi-asset, clinical stage, pharmaceutical company focused on immunology and infectious diseases, today announced that they have entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement for the development and commercialization of orismilast in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.

Under the terms of the agreement, UNION grants Innovent an exclusive license to research, develop and commercialize orismilast in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, including participating in and recruiting Chinese patients for potential future global studies of orismilast. UNION will receive an upfront payment of <span class=""xn-money"">USD 20 million</span> and is further entitled to receive up to <span class=""xn-money"">USD 247 million</span> in milestone payments as well as tiered royalties on sales of orismilast in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. UNION will retain global rights for orismilast outside of <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.

In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> there are approximately fifty million patients suffering from atopic dermatitis and six million patients suffering from psoriasis, and their prevalence is rising with changing lifestyles. Current standard of care treatments are topical steroids, oral immunosuppressants and injectable biologics, all of which have certain limitations in efficacy, safety or route of administration, presenting significant unmet clinical needs. In Phase 2a clinical studies, orismilast has demonstrated potential best-in-class profiles in these conditions, with a combination of improved efficacy and tolerability, and could be well positioned to address the unmet needs of these patient populations.

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Yongjun Liu</span>, President of Innovent, said: ""We are very pleased to enter a collaboration with UNION. We have been impressed with our partner's capability to advance the global development of orismilast and we are excited to help bring orismilast to patients in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. This collaboration further strengthens our position in autoimmune by adding a mid-stage potential best-in-class therapy into our portfolio. Innovent is proud to be an ideal partner for worldwide biotech and pharmaceutical companies in terms of accelerating the development and commercialization progress of novel assets to benefit a broader patient population.""

Kim Kjøller, Chief Executive Officer of UNION therapeutics, said, ""We are excited to enter into this strategic collaboration with Innovent, whose deep insights and presence in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> make them an ideal partner to bring orismilast to Chinese patients. We are impressed by Innovent's track record of international partnering, advancing assets through clinical development and commercial execution. This agreement provides independent validation of our belief in the best-in-class potential of orismilast, and expands our global footprint in an underserved market with significant potential. Partnering with pharmaceutical companies is core to our strategy of maximizing the value of our product candidates, and we are therefore excited to enter this collaboration with an internationally recognized partner.""

<b>About orismilast</b>

Orismilast is a potent and selective, next-generation PDE4 inhibitor with broad anti-inflammatory properties, which was originally developed by LEO Pharma and acquired by UNION in 2020. Orismilast has generated positive proof of concept data orally in psoriasis and topically in atopic dermatitis and is being developed as a potential best- or first-in-class treatment option in both diseases. The selectivity of orismilast for PDE4 subtypes B and D and the novel modified release delivery is expected to result in an attractive therapeutic window, i.e., the combination of improved efficacy and tolerability, compared to other PDE4 inhibitors. UNION has two product candidates with orismilast in Phase 2 clinical development: UNI50001, an oral PDE4 inhibitor investigated for the treatment of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and hidradenitis suppurativa; and UNI50002, the topical formulation of orismilast investigated for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. The safety and tolerability of PDE4 inhibitors is well understood, with two oral treatments and one topical currently approved and marketed.

<h3><b><i>Saphnelo is a first-in-class type I interferon receptor antibody shown to reduce overall disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus
</i></b></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca’s <i>Saphnelo</i> (anifrolumab) has been approved in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a serious autoimmune disease, who show insufficient response to currently available treatment.

The approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) was based on efficacy and safety data from the <i>Saphnelo</i> clinical development programme, including the TULIP Phase III trials and the MUSE Phase II trial. In these trials, more patients treated with <i>Saphnelo</i> experienced a reduction in overall disease activity across organ systems, including skin and joints, and achieved sustained reduction in oral corticosteroid (OCS) use compared to placebo, with both groups receiving standard therapy.<sup>1,2,3</sup>

This decision marks the first regulatory approval by the MHLW for a type I interferon (type I IFN) receptor antagonist in Japan. Type I IFN plays a central role in the pathophysiology in lupus and increased type I IFN signalling has been shown to be associated with increased disease activity and severity.<sup>4,5,6,7,8</sup>

Dr. Yoshiya Tanaka, Professor in the First Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan and an investigator in the TULIP-2 trial, said: “Compared with other rheumatic diseases, there are limited treatments available for systemic lupus erythematosus and outcomes remain poor for patients in Japan and around the world. Through our own local experience with anifrolumab in clinical trials, we have observed impressive efficacy and improved patient outcomes.”

Dr. Tsutomu Takeuchi, Emeritus Professor of Keio University, Tokyo, Japan and an investigator in the TULIP-2 trial, said: “Our treatment goals in systemic lupus erythematosus are to reduce disease activity, improve quality of life and prevent organ damage from either the disease or the medications used to treat it, especially corticosteroids. Innovative treatments are needed to address these goals. The anifrolumab clinical programme provided compelling evidence that blocking type I interferon is a promising new strategy in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus reducing both disease activity across organ systems and corticosteroid use.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “<i>Saphnelo </i>is the first and only type I interferon receptor antagonist to receive approval in Japan and represents a major advance in treating systemic lupus erythematosus, a complex heterogenous disease that is challenging to treat and often debilitating for patients. We will now work to bring this medicine to patients in Japan living with this disease as quickly as possible.”

The adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in patients who received <i>Saphnelo </i>in clinical trials included upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivity reactions and herpes zoster.<sup>1,2,3</sup>

SLE  can affect any organ, and people often experience inadequate disease control, long-term organ damage and poor health-related quality of life.<sup>9,10,11,12 </sup>SLE is designated as an Intractable Disease in Japan through a programme that incentivises research and development of drugs to treat rare diseases that lack effective treatments, and also helps reduce cost burden on patients.<sup>13</sup> There are approximately 60,000 registered patients with SLE in Japan, and the majority are women diagnosed before age 45.<sup>14,15</sup>

Results from the TULIP-2 Phase III trial were published in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1912196"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>, results from the TULIP-1 Phase III trial were published in <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(19)30076-1/fulltext"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The Lancet Rheumatology</i></a> and results from the MUSE Phase II trial were published in <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/art.39962"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology</i></a>. The sub-analysis of patients in Japan enrolled in TULIP-2 was presented at the <a href=""https://www.ryumachi-jp.com/publication/pdf/mr_supple_all_2021.pdf"" rel=""link-confirmation"">Japan College of Rheumatology annual meeting</a> in April 2021. Efficacy and safety results from the sub-analysis were consistent with the overall trial populations.<sup>16</sup>

<i>Saphnelo</i> is <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/saphnelo-approved-in-the-us-for-sle.html"">approved</a> in the US for the treatment of moderate to severe SLE and is under regulatory review for SLE in the EU. A Phase III trial in SLE using subcutaneous delivery has been initiated and additional Phase III trials are planned for lupus nephritis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus and myositis.

<b>Financial considerations
</b>AstraZeneca acquired global rights to <i>Saphnelo</i> through an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Medarex, Inc. in 2004. The option for Medarex to co-promote the product expired on its acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) in 2009. Under the agreement AstraZeneca will pay BMS a low to mid-teens royalty for sales dependent on geography.

<b>Systemic lupus erythematosus
</b>SLE is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue in the body.<sup>17</sup> It is a chronic and complex disease with a variety of clinical manifestations that can impact many organs and can cause a range of symptoms including pain, rashes, fatigue, swelling in joints and fevers.<sup>10</sup> More than 50% of patients with SLE develop permanent organ damage, caused by the disease or existing treatments, which exacerbates symptoms and increases the risk of mortality.<sup>18,19</sup> At least five million people worldwide have a form of lupus.<sup>20</sup>

<b>TULIP-1, TULIP-2 and MUSE
</b>All three trials for <i>Saphnelo </i>(TULIP-1, TULIP-2 and MUSE) were randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials in patients with moderate to severe SLE who were receiving standard therapy.<sup> </sup>Standard therapy included at least one of the following: OCS, antimalarials and immunosuppressants (methotrexate, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil).<sup>1,2,3</sup>

The pivotal TULIP (Treatment of Uncontrolled Lupus via the Interferon Pathway) Phase III programme included two trials, <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2018/update-on-tulip-1-phase-iii-trial-for-anifrolumab-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-31082018.html"">TULIP-1</a> and <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/anifrolumab-demonstrated-superiority-across-multiple-efficacy-endpoints-in-patients-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-phase-iii-tulip-2-trial.html"">TULIP-2</a>, that evaluated the efficacy and safety of <i>Saphnelo </i>versus placebo.<sup>1,2</sup> TULIP-2 demonstrated superiority across multiple efficacy endpoints versus placebo with both arms receiving standard therapy.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","STOCKHOLM, Sept. 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — BioArctic AB’s (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BIOA B) partner Eisai today announced that they have initiated a rolling submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for lecanemab (BAN2401), an investigational anti-amyloid beta (Aß) protofibril antibody, for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease (early AD). The BLA is being submitted under the accelerated approval pathway and is primarily based on clinical, biomarker and safety data from the Phase 2b clinical trial in people with early Alzheimer’s disease and confirmed amyloid pathology. The lecanemab Phase 2b trial results demonstrated a high degree of Aß plaque lowering and consistent reduction of clinical decline across several clinical endpoints. The correlation between the extent of Aß plaque reduction and effect on clinical endpoints in the Phase 2b study further supports Aß as a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. AD is a serious, progressive and devastating disease with few treatment options. Eisai is utilizing the accelerated approval pathway after discussions with the FDA and aims to bring a new potential treatment option to people living with early AD, their families and healthcare professionals.

In June 2021, lecanemab was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation, which is an FDA program intended to expedite the development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening conditions. Eisai has an agreement with the FDA to submit the BLA for lecanemab as a rolling submission. This agreement allows completed portions of the application to be submitted to the FDA for review on an ongoing basis. After all portions are submitted to the FDA and the agency accepts the BLA, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date (target date for completion of examination) will be set.

The BLA submission for lecanemab is primarily based on the results of the proof-of-concept Phase 2b study in 856 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD (collectively known as early AD) with confirmed presence of amyloid pathology. The results were published in a peer-reviewed journal in April 2021.  The Phase 2b study explored the impact of treatment with lecanemab on reducing brain Aß and clinical decline. At 18 months of treatment, 10-mg/kg biweekly lecanemab reduced brain amyloid by 0.306 SUVr units (from a baseline mean of 1.37), and over 80% of subjects became amyloid negative by visual read. Furthermore, the extent of reduction in amyloid was correlated with slower clinical decline on ADCOMS (Alzheimer’s Disease Composite Score), CDR-SB (Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes), and ADAS-cog (Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale) at the treatment group and patient level. The rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion (ARIA-E), an adverse event associated with amyloid targeted therapies, for the 10 mg/kg biweekly dosing was 9.9%.

After completion of the Core period and a Gap period off treatment (average of 24 months), all 180 patients in the Phase 2b open-label extension study received 10 mg/kg bi-weekly lecanemab dosing. The data confirmed lecanemab produces reductions of amyloid PET SUVr, with significant reduction occurring as early as 3 months, and >80% of subjects achieved amyloid negative status by visual read in as early as 12 months. Significant amyloid reduction relative to placebo in those exposed to lecanemab in the Core period was maintained while off-treatment over the Gap period. The rate of ARIA-E was consistent with the Core study at around 10%.

The lecanemab Clarity AD Phase 3 clinical trial in early AD is ongoing and completed enrollment in March 2021 with 1,795 patients. The U.S. FDA has agreed that the results of Clarity AD, when completed, can serve as the confirmatory study to verify the clinical benefit of lecanemab. Blinded safety data from Clarity AD will be included to support the BLA.

“We are very impressed with our partner Eisai’s diligent work and clinical programs to progress the development of lecanemab. Alzheimer’s disease is devastating and the rolling BLA submission for lecanemab brings us one step closer to potentially being able to offer a new treatment option to millions of patients and their families,” said BioArctic’s CEO Gunilla Osswald.

<span class=""selection-bold"">London, 28 September 2021</span> – ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), with Pfizer and Shionogi as shareholders, today announced an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with Shionogi &amp; Co. Ltd. (Shionogi) for S-365598, a third-generation investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) with potential for use in ultra long-acting HIV regimens (regimens with dosing intervals of three months or longer).

Under the terms of the agreement, ViiV Healthcare will make an upfront payment of £20 million to Shionogi, a £15 million payment for the achievement of a clinical development milestone and royalties on net sales. The royalty levels are aligned with those in Shionogi’s existing integrase inhibitor agreements with ViiV Healthcare. Shionogi will contribute to development costs up to an annual maximum.

<span class=""selection-bold"">Kimberly Smith, M.D., MPH, Head of Research &amp; Development at ViiV Healthcare</span> said: “Our 20-year relationship with Shionogi has been incredibly successful, producing what are arguably two of the most important HIV medicines of the last decade. Dolutegravir is now taken by 17 million people globally, and cabotegravir has allowed us to develop the first long-acting regimen for treatment. With today’s announcement about the in-licensing of a third integrase inhibitor from Shionogi, we will continue this collaboration and explore the potential of S-365598 to anchor ViiV Healthcare’s pipeline beyond 2030.”

<span class=""selection-bold"">John Keller, Ph.D., Senior Executive Officer, Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy Division at Shionogi</span> said: “Many people living with HIV and those vulnerable to acquiring HIV have concerns about daily oral medication, such as the daily reminder of living with HIV, HIV status disclosure and consistency of adherence. Long-acting HIV medications have the potential to bring considerable benefit to these individuals. We are looking forward to continuing to work with ViiV to further advance this innovative approach to HIV therapies.”

Preliminary data has shown that S-365598 has a high genetic barrier and a resistance profile that is distinct from that of dolutegravir and cabotegravir. Its long half-life may support its development as an ultra-long medicine that could be delivered with infrequent dosing of every three months or longer.

Preclinical studies are underway. ViiV Healthcare and Shionogi intend to initiate first time in human studies with S-365598 by 2023.

<strong>Important Safety Information for Cabenuva (cabotegravir 200 mg/mL; rilpivirine 300 mg/mL) extended release injectable suspensions</strong>

Cabenuva is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine.

<strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Do not use Cabenuva in patients with previous hypersensitivity reaction to cabotegravir or rilpivirine.</li>
 	<li>Do not use Cabenuva in patients receiving carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine, systemic dexamethasone (&gt;1 dose), and St John’s wort.</li>
</ul>
<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>

<span class=""selection-bold"">Hypersensitivity Reactions:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), have been reported during postmarketing experience with rilpivirine-containing regimens. While some skin reactions were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, other skin reactions were associated with organ dysfunctions, including elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries.</li>
 	<li>Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with other integrase inhibitors and could occur with Cabenuva.</li>
 	<li>Discontinue Cabenuva immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop. Clinical status, including liver transaminases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Prescribe the oral lead-in prior to administration of Cabenuva to help identify patients who may be at risk of a hypersensitivity reaction.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Post-Injection Reactions:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Serious post-injection reactions (reported in less than 1% of subjects) were reported within minutes after the injection of rilpivirine, including dyspnea, agitation, abdominal cramping, flushing, sweating, oral numbness, and changes in blood pressure. These events may have been associated with inadvertent (partial) intravenous administration and began to resolve within a few minutes after the injection.</li>
 	<li>Carefully follow the Instructions for Use when preparing and administering Cabenuva to avoid accidental intravenous administration. Observe patients briefly (approximately 10 minutes) after the injection. If a post-injection reaction occurs, monitor and treat as clinically indicated.</li>
</ul>
<span class=""selection-bold"">Hepatotoxicity:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving cabotegravir or rilpivirine with or without known pre-existing hepatic disease or identifiable risk factors.</li>
 	<li>Patients with underlying liver disease or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations.</li>
 	<li>Monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended and treatment with Cabenuva should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity is suspected.</li>
</ul>
<span class=""selection-bold"">Depressive Disorders:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Depressive disorders (including depressed mood, depression, major depression, mood altered, mood swings, dysphoria, negative thoughts, suicidal ideation or attempt) have been reported with Cabenuva or the individual products.</li>
 	<li>Promptly evaluate patients with depressive symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<span class=""selection-bold"">Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>The concomitant use of Cabenuva and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions (see Contraindications and Drug Interactions).</li>
 	<li>Rilpivirine doses 3 and 12 times higher than the recommended oral dosage can prolong the QTc interval. Cabenuva should be used with caution in combination with drugs with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.</li>
</ul>
<span class=""selection-bold"">Long-Acting Properties and Potential Associated Risks with Cabenuva:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Residual concentrations of cabotegravir and rilpivirine may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for prolonged periods (up to 12 months or longer). Select appropriate patients who agree to the required monthly injection dosing schedule because non-adherence to monthly injections or missed doses could lead to loss of virologic response and development of resistance.</li>
 	<li>To minimize the potential risk of developing viral resistance, it is essential to initiate an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than 1 month after the final injection doses of Cabenuva. If virologic failure is suspected, switch the patient to an alternative regimen as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<span class=""selection-bold"">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>
<ul>
 	<li>The most common adverse reactions (incidence =2%, all grades) with Cabenuva were injection site reactions, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, sleep disorders, dizziness, and rash.</li>
</ul>
<span class=""selection-bold"">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Refer to the applicable full Prescribing Information for important drug interactions with Cabenuva, Vocabria, or rilpivirine.</li>
 	<li>Because Cabenuva is a complete regimen, coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended.</li>
 	<li>Drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or 1A9 are expected to decrease the plasma concentrations of cabotegravir. Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A may affect the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine.</li>
 	<li>Cabenuva should be used with caution in combination with drugs with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.</li>
</ul>
<span class=""selection-bold"">USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</span>
<ul>

<strong>Ingelheim, Germany, September 27, 2021</strong> – Boehringer Ingelheim, a global leader in animal health, and Invetx, a Boston-based pioneer in protein-based therapeutics for animal health, announce that they have entered into a collaboration agreement to develop novel, species-specific monoclonal antibody biotherapeutics targeting a wide range of diseases in the veterinary species, initially focused on dogs and cats.

For each selected disease target, Invetx will apply its unique platform to the discovery and optimization of best-in-class candidates and Boehringer Ingelheim will advance these therapies through clinical and regulatory development to bring them to market. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

“This partnership is a prime example of Boehringer Ingelheim’s commitment to address unmet needs in the rapidly growing animal health market,” shared Eric Haaksma, Head of Global Innovation, Animal Health at Boehringer Ingelheim. “We were drawn to working with Invetx because of the company’s cutting-edge discovery platform, optimization technologies and antibody expertise. Together, we will leverage innovation to discover breakthrough scientific advancements to improve animal health.”

Today, monoclonal antibodies are currently used in the treatment of many human diseases. The therapy is a form of immunotherapy that uses monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to bind monospecifically to certain cells or proteins, mimicking the body’s own natural response to attack those cells. Leveraging the technology in animal health creates great potential to address unmet needs.

Invetx’s fully integrated platform encompassing discovery, product development and commercial manufacturing sets a new standard for veterinary biotherapeutics. By leveraging validated technologies in human biotech and optimizing them for veterinary application, Invetx can generate differentiated antibodies against a wide range of targets to treat a variety of chronic and serious diseases in animals.

“We are thrilled to partner with global animal health leader Boehringer Ingelheim, using our unique discovery platform to deliver fully species-specific, optimized and half-life extended biotherapeutics,” said Juergen Horn, PhD, Chief Executive Officer, Invetx. “These programs will complement our own proprietary portfolio and strengthen our position as a leader in creating novel, transformative and best-in-class therapies for veterinary patients.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval of a new indication for ERBITUX® (cetuximab injection) in combination with BRAFTOVI® (encorafenib), marketed by Pfizer, Inc., for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, after prior therapy.1 ERBITUX is the first and only anti-EGFR antibody approved, in combination with encorafenib, for this indication and is based on results from Pfizer’s BEACON CRC trial, the only Phase 3 trial to specifically study patients with previously treated metastatic CRC with a BRAF V600E mutation. With this approval, ERBITUX has now received seven FDA approvals to treat certain types of CRC and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

“The BEACON study showed that the combination of ERBITUX and encorafenib significantly improved overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation – a subtype that typically has worse outcomes compared to those without the mutation,” said David Hyman, M.D., chief medical officer, oncology at Lilly. “We are grateful to Pfizer for their collaboration as we’ve worked to bring this treatment regimen to patients.”

Based on results from the BEACON CRC trial, ERBITUX plus encorafenib showed a median overall survival (OS) of 8.4 months (95% CI: 7.5, 11.0), compared to 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.8, 6.6) for the control arm (irinotecan with ERBITUX or FOLFIRI with ERBITUX) ([HR 0.60, (95% CI: 0.45, 0.79), p=0.0003]). Additionally, ERBITUX plus encorafenib showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 20% (95% CI: 13%, 29%), compared to 2% (95% CI: 0%, 7%) for the control arm (p<0.0001), and a median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.4), compared to 1.5 months for the control arm (95% CI: 1.4, 1.7) ([HR 0.40, (95% CI: 0.31, 0.52), p<0.0001]).

The safety of ERBITUX (400 mg/m2 initial infusion, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly) in combination with encorafenib (300 mg once daily) was evaluated in 216 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic CRC in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (BEACON CRC).

The most common (=25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving ERBITUX in combination with encorafenib were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dermatitis acneiform, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, arthralgia, and rash.

The labeling for ERBITUX includes warnings and precautions for infusion reactions, cardiopulmonary arrest, pulmonary toxicity, dermatologic toxicity, hypomagnesemia and accompanying electrolyte abnormalities, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Please see below for full Important Safety Information.

On April 8, 2020, Pfizer’s encorafenib was approved by the FDA for this indication, based on data from the BEACON CRC study.

About the BEACON CRC Study
Encorafenib in combination with ERBITUX was evaluated in the randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 BEACON CRC trial. Eligible patients were required to have BRAF V600E mutant metastatic CRC, as detected by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression after one or two prior regimens. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment arms:

Encorafenib 300 mg orally once daily in combination with ERBITUX (encorafenib/ ERBITUX arm)
Encorafenib 300 mg orally once daily in combination with ERBITUX and binimetinib
Irinotecan with ERBITUX or FOLFIRI with ERBITUX (control arm)
The major efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures included PFS, ORR, and duration of response (DoR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). OS and PFS were assessed in all randomized patients. ORR and DoR were assessed in the subset of the first 220 patients included in the randomized portion of the encorafenib/ERBITUX and control arm of the study. A total of 220 patients were randomized to the encorafenib/ERBITUX arm and 221 to the control arm. The trial was conducted at over 200 investigational sites in North America, South America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region.

About Colorectal Cancer
Worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death. With approximately 1.9 million new diagnoses in 2020, CRC is third most common type of cancer in men and the second most common in women.1 In the U.S. alone, an estimated 149,500 people will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2021, and approximately 53,000 are estimated to die of the disease each year.2 BRAF mutations are estimated to occur in up to 15 percent of people with metastatic CRC and represent a poor prognosis for these patients.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 The BRAF V600E mutation is the most common BRAF mutation and the risk of mortality in CRC patients with the BRAF V600E mutation is more than two times higher than for those with wild-type BRAF.5, 6

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ERBITUX® (cetuximab)

WARNING:  INFUSION REACTIONS AND CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST

Infusion Reactions

•

ERBITUX can cause serious and fatal infusion reactions.  Severe (Grades 3 and 4) infusion reactions occurred in 2.2% of patients receiving ERBITUX in clinical trials.

•

The risk of anaphylactic reactions may be increased in patients with a history of tick bites, red meat allergy, or in the presence of IgE antibodies directed against galactose-a-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal). Consider testing patients for alpha-gal IgE antibodies using FDA-cleared methods prior to initiating ERBITUX. Negative results for alpha-gal antibodies do not rule out the risk of severe infusion reactions.

•

Approximately 90% of the severe infusion reactions occurred with the first infusion of ERBITUX despite premedication with antihistamines.

o

Serious infusion reactions, requiring immediate medical intervention, included symptoms of rapid onset of airway obstruction (bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness), hypotension, shock, loss of consciousness, myocardial infarction, and/or cardiac arrest.  Immediately interrupt and permanently discontinue ERBITUX infusion for serious infusion reactions.

o

Caution must be exercised with every ERBITUX infusion as infusion reactions may occur during or several hours following completion of the infusion.

o

Premedicate with a histamine-1 (H1) receptor antagonist as recommended.

o

Monitor patients for at least 1 hour following each ERBITUX infusion in a setting with resuscitation equipment and other agents necessary to treat anaphylaxis.  In patients requiring treatment for infusion reactions, monitor for more than 1 hour to confirm resolution of the reaction.  Interrupt the infusion and upon recovery, resume the infusion at a slower rate or permanently discontinue ERBITUX based on severity.

Cardiopulmonary Arrest

•

ERBITUX can cause cardiopulmonary arrest.  Cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death occurred in 2% of 208 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving radiation therapy and ERBITUX in BONNER.  In 3 patients with prior history of coronary artery disease, death occurred 27, 32, and 43 days respectively after the last dose of ERBITUX.  One patient with no prior history of coronary artery disease died one day after the last dose of ERBITUX. In EXTREME, fatal cardiac disorders and/or sudden death occurred in 3% of the 219 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with a cetuximab product in combination with platinum-based therapy and fluorouracil. 

o

Carefully consider the use of ERBITUX with radiation therapy, or with platinum-based therapy with fluorouracil, in head and neck cancer patients with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.

o

Closely monitor serum electrolytes, including serum magnesium, potassium, and calcium, during and after ERBITUX therapy.

Pulmonary Toxicity

ERBITUX can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD). ILD, which was fatal in one case, occurred in <0.5% of 1570 patients receiving ERBITUX in clinical trials. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Interrupt or permanently discontinue ERBITUX for acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms. Permanently discontinue ERBITUX for confirmed ILD.
Dermatologic Toxicities

ERBITUX can cause dermatologic toxicities, including acneiform rash, skin drying and fissuring, paronychial inflammation, infectious sequelae (e.g., S. aureus sepsis, abscess formation, cellulitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis/ulcerative keratitis with decreased visual acuity, cheilitis), and hypertrichosis
Acneiform rash occurred in 82% of the 1373 patients who received ERBITUX across clinical trials. Severe (Grades 3 or 4) acneiform rash occurred in 10% of patients. Acneiform rash usually developed within the first 2 weeks of therapy; the rash lasted more than 28 days after stopping ERBITUX in most patients.
Life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing has been observed in patients who received ERBITUX. It could not be determined whether these mucocutaneous adverse reactions were directly related to EGFR inhibition or to idiosyncratic immune-related effects (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis).
Monitor patients receiving ERBITUX for dermatologic toxicities and infectious sequelae.
Sun exposure may exacerbate these effects. Instruct patients to limit sun exposure during ERBITUX therapy.
Withhold, reduce dose or permanently discontinue ERBITUX based on severity of acneiform rash or mucocutaneous disease.
Risks Associated with Use in Combination with Radiation and Cisplatin

ERBITUX is not indicated for the treatment of SCCHN in combination with radiation and cisplatin.
In a controlled study, 940 patients with locally advanced SCCHN were randomized 1:1 to receive either ERBITUX in combination with radiation therapy and cisplatin, or radiation therapy and cisplatin alone. The addition of ERBITUX resulted in an increase in the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 mucositis, radiation recall syndrome, acneiform rash, cardiac events, and electrolyte disturbances compared to radiation and cisplatin alone.
Adverse reactions with fatal outcome were reported in 4% of patients in the ERBITUX combination arm and 3% in the control arm.
In the ERBITUX arm, 2% experienced myocardial ischemia compared to 0.9% in the control arm.
The addition of ERBITUX to radiation and cisplatin did not improve progression-free survival (the primary endpoint).
Hypomagnesemia and Accompanying Electrolyte Abnormalities

ERBITUX can cause hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia occurred in 55% of 365 patients receiving ERBITUX in study CA225-025 and two other clinical trials in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) or head and neck cancer, including Grades 3 and 4 in 6% to 17%. In EXTREME, where a cetuximab product was administered in combination with platinum-based therapy, the addition cetuximab to cisplatin and fluorouracil resulted in an increased incidence of hypomagnesemia of any grade (14%) and of Grade 3 or 4 hypomagnesemia (7%). Hypomagnesemia of any grade occurred in 4% of patients who received cetuximab, carboplatin, and fluorouracil. No patient experienced grade 3 or 4 hypomagnesemia. The onset of hypomagnesemia and accompanying electrolyte abnormalities can occur days to months after initiating ERBITUX.
Monitor patients weekly during treatment for hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia, and for at least 8 weeks following the completion of ERBITUX.
Replete electrolytes as necessary.
Increased Tumor Progression, Increased Mortality, or Lack of Benefit in Patients with Ras–Mutant mCRC

ERBITUX is not indicated for the treatment of patients with CRC that harbor somatic mutations in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) of either K-Ras or N-Ras and hereafter referred to as “Ras” or when the Ras status is unknown.
Retrospective subset analyses of Ras-mutant and wild-type populations across several randomized clinical trials, including CRYSTAL, were conducted to investigate the role of Ras mutations on the clinical effects of anti-EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies. Use of cetuximab in patients with Ras mutations resulted in no clinical benefit with treatment related toxicity. Confirm Ras mutation status in tumor specimens prior to initiating ERBITUX.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, ERBITUX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data for ERBITUX exposure in pregnant women. In an animal reproduction study, intravenous administration of cetuximab once weekly to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality and abortion. Disruption or depletion of EGFR in animal models results in impairment of embryo-fetal development including effects on placental, lung, cardiac, skin, and neural development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ERBITUX and for 2 months after the last dose of ERBITUX. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ERBITUX.
Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions (all grades; incidence =25%) seen in patients with carcinomas of the head and neck receiving ERBITUX in combination with radiation therapy (n=208) versus radiation alone (n=212) (BONNER) were acneiform rash (87% vs 10%), radiation dermatitis (86% vs 90%), weight loss (84% vs 72%), asthenia (56% vs 49%), nausea (49% vs 37%), increased alanine transaminase (43% vs 21%), increased aspartate transaminase (38% vs 24%), increased alkaline phosphatase (33% vs 24%), fever (29% vs 13%), emesis (29% vs 23%), pharyngitis (26% vs 19%) and dehydration (25% vs 19%). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions for ERBITUX in combination with radiation therapy (=10%) versus radiation alone included: radiation dermatitis (23% vs 18%), acneiform rash (17% vs 1%), and weight loss (11% vs 7%). The overall incidence of late radiation toxicities (any grade) was higher for patients receiving ERBITUX in combination with radiation therapy, versus radiation therapy alone. The following sites were affected: salivary glands (65% vs 56%), larynx (52% vs 36%), subcutaneous tissue (49% vs 45%), mucous membrane (48% vs 39%), esophagus (44% vs 35%), skin (42% vs 33%). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 late radiation toxicities was similar between radiation therapy alone and the ERBITUX with radiation treatment groups.
The most common adverse reactions (all grades; incidence =25%) seen in patients with carcinomas of the head and neck receiving a cetuximab product in combination with platinum-based therapy and fluorouracil (CT) (n=219) versus CT alone (n=215) (EXTREME) were acneiform rash (70% vs 2%), nausea (54% vs 47%), infection (44% vs 27%), rash (28% vs 2%), diarrhea (26% vs 16%) and anorexia (25% vs 14%). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse reaction for a cetuximab product in combination with CT (=10%) versus CT alone was infection (11% vs 8%). Because ERBITUX provides approximately 22% higher exposure relative to the cetuximab product used in EXTREME, the data provided above may underestimate the incidence and severity of adverse reactions anticipated with ERBITUX for this indication. However, the tolerability of the recommended dose is supported by safety data from additional studies of ERBITUX.
The most common adverse reactions (all grades; incidence =25%) seen in patients with K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing mCRC treated with a cetuximab product in combination with FOLFIRI (n=317) versus FOLFIRI alone (n=350) (CRYSTAL) were acne-like rash (86% vs 13%), diarrhea (66% vs 60%), neutropenia (49% vs 42%), rash (44% vs 4%), stomatitis (31% vs 19%), anorexia (30% vs 23%), dermatitis acneiform (26% vs <1%) and pyrexia (26% vs 14%). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions (=10%) included: neutropenia (31% vs 24%), acne-like rash (18% vs <1%), and diarrhea (16% vs 10%). ERBITUX provides approximately 22% higher exposure compared to the cetuximab product used in CRYSTAL; however, the safety data from CRYSTAL is consistent in incidence and severity of adverse reactions with those seen for ERBITUX in this indication.
The most common adverse reactions (all grades; incidence =25%) seen in patients with K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing mCRC treated with ERBITUX + best supportive care (BSC) (n=118) versus BSC alone (n=124) (CA225-025) were rash/desquamation (95% vs 21%), fatigue (91% vs 79%), nausea (64% vs 50%), pain-other (59% vs 37%), dry skin (57% vs 15%), constipation (53% vs 38%), dyspnea (49% vs 44%), pruritus (47% vs 11%), neuropathy-sensory (45% vs 38%), diarrhea (42% vs 23%), vomiting (40% vs 26%), headache (38% vs 11%), infection without neutropenia (38% vs 19%), other-dermatology (35% vs 7%), stomatitis (32% vs 10%), nail changes (31% vs 4%), cough (30% vs 19%), insomnia (27% vs 13%) and fever (25% vs 16%). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions (=10%) included: fatigue (31% vs 29%), pain-other (18% vs 10%), rash/desquamation (16% vs 1%), dyspnea (16% vs 13%), other-gastrointestinal (12% vs 5%), and infection without neutropenia (11% vs 5%).
The most common adverse reactions (all grades) seen in patients with EGFR-expressing recurrent mCRC (n=354) treated with ERBITUX plus irinotecan in clinical trials (CP02-9923 and BOND) were acneiform rash (88%), asthenia/malaise (73%), diarrhea (72%), and nausea (55%). The most common grade 3-4 adverse reactions included: diarrhea (22%), leukopenia (17%), asthenia/malaise (16%), and acneiform rash (14%).
The most common adverse reactions (all grades; incidence =25%) seen in patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC treated with ERBITUX in combination with encorafenib (N=216) versus ERBITUX with irinotecan or ERBITUX with FOLFIRI (N=193) (BEACON) were fatigue (51% vs 50%), nausea (34% vs 41%), diarrhea (33% vs 48%), dermatitis acneiform (32% vs 43%), abdominal pain (30% vs 32%), decreased appetite (27% vs 27%), arthralgia (27% vs 3%) and rash (26% vs 26%). Other clinically important adverse reactions occurring in <10% of patients who received ERBITUX in combination with encorafenib were pancreatitis. The most common laboratory abnormalities (all grades; incidence =20%) seen in patients receiving ERBITUX in combination with encorafenib versus ERBITUX with irinotecan or ERBITUX with FOLFIRI (BEACON) were anemia (34% vs 48%) and lymphopenia (24% vs 35%).
Use in Specific Populations

Lactation: There is no information regarding the presence of ERBITUX in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG antibodies can be excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ERBITUX, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ERBITUX and for at least 2 months after the last dose of ERBITUX.
Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ERBITUX in pediatric patients have not been established. No new safety signals were identified in pediatric patients when ERBITUX in combination with irinotecan was administered in an open-label, single-arm dose-finding study in 27 patients with refractory solid tumors aged 1 to 12 years old and in 19 patients aged 13 to 18 years old.
Geriatric Use:  In SCCHN clinical studies of ERBITUX there were insufficient number of patients >65 years of age to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.

""Millions of people living with migraine often lose days of productivity each month because attacks can be debilitating. QULIPTA can help by reducing monthly migraine days with a once-daily, oral dose that works quickly and continuously,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Michael Severino</span>, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. ""We are proud that AbbVie is now the only pharmaceutical company to offer three products across the full spectrum of migraine treatment, which include preventive therapies for chronic and episodic migraine and an acute treatment for migraine attacks.""

The approval is supported by data from a robust clinical program evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of QULIPTA in nearly 2,000 patients who experienced 4 to 14 migraine days per month, including the pivotal Phase 3 ADVANCE study — which was published in <i><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3305026-1&amp;h=3192439868&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2035908%3Fquery%3Dfeatured_home&amp;a=The+New+England+Journal+of+Medicine"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The New England Journal of Medicine</a></i> — the pivotal Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span>/3 study, and the Phase 3 long-term safety study.<sup>1,2</sup>

""When I have a migraine attack, my 5-year-old daughter doesn't understand why I can't take her to a birthday party or to the park. It's heartbreaking when I have to tell her I need to be away from her because my eyes feel like they're going to explode out of my head,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Kelsi Owens</span>, an ADVANCE trial participant who has lived with migraine for nearly three decades. ""During the trial while taking QULIPTA, I had many fewer migraine days. For the first time ever, I don't have difficulty doing my daily activities and I don't have to worry as much that a migraine attack will cause me to miss important events with family and friends.""

Migraine is a complex disease with recurrent attacks that are often incapacitating and characterized by severe, throbbing headache pain as well as compounding associated symptoms like extreme sensitivity to light, sound or nausea.<sup>4</sup> It is highly prevalent, affecting more than 1 billion people worldwide, including 39 million people in the U.S. alone,<sup>5</sup> and is the highest cause of disability worldwide for people under 50 years of age.<sup>6,7</sup>

""This approval reflects a broader shift in the treatment and management paradigm for the migraine community. QULIPTA provides a simple oral treatment option specifically developed to prevent migraine attacks and target CGRP, which is believed to be crucially involved in migraine in many patients,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Peter J. Goadsby</span>, M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc., neurologist and professor at <span class=""xn-org"">University of California, Los Angeles</span>, and King's College, <span class=""xn-location"">London</span>, who earned the prestigious Brain Prize in 2021 for his revolutionary research about CGRP's role in migraine attacks and co-authored the ADVANCE study.

""I'm particularly encouraged by the convenience of the oral daily use of QULIPTA, its rapid onset of significant efficacy, and its safety and tolerability as well as its high patient response rates. This is a milestone in preventive migraine treatment that I hope will help many patients for years to come,"" Goadsby said.

<b>Highlights from the clinical program supporting the approval and additional data analysis include:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>In the pivotal Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group ADVANCE trial, the primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period. All QULIPTA dose groups met the primary endpoint and demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean monthly migraine days compared to placebo. Patients treated with 60 mg of QULIPTA across 12 weeks experienced a 4.2-day reduction from baseline of 7.8.<sup>1</sup></li>
 	<li>A key secondary endpoint in the ADVANCE trial measured the proportion of patients that achieved a =50% reduction in monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period. The trial demonstrated that 56%/59%/61% of patients in the 10 mg/30 mg/60 mg QULIPTA arms, respectively, achieved a 50-100% reduction, compared to 29% of patients in the placebo arm (all dose groups vs. placebo, p&lt;.001).<sup>1</sup></li>
 	<li>All doses were well tolerated in the ADVANCE trial and pivotal Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span>/3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally administered QULIPTA. Adverse reactions in both studies (incidence at least 2% and greater than placebo) included nausea (5-9% across all doses versus 3% for placebo), constipation (6% across all doses versus 1% for placebo), fatigue/somnolence (4-6% across all doses versus 3% for placebo) and decreased appetite (1-2% across all doses versus &lt;1% for placebo). The adverse reactions that most commonly led to discontinuation were constipation (0.5%), nausea (0.5%) and fatigue/somnolence (0.5%).<sup>1</sup></li>
 	<li>The pivotal Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span>/3 trial demonstrated that all active treatment arms met the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days with significantly greater reductions in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period for all three QULIPTA treatment groups compared with placebo. All three QULIPTA treatment groups also met the secondary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in mean monthly headache days.<sup>1</sup></li>

<b>About QULIPTA™</b>

QULIPTA™ (atogepant) is the first and only oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant) specifically developed for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. CGRP and its receptors are expressed in regions of the nervous system associated with migraine pathophysiology, and studies have shown that CGRP levels are elevated during migraine attacks. QULIPTA blocks CGRP through a once-daily dose and is available in three strengths – 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg.

QULIPTA will be available in early <span class=""xn-chron"">October 2021</span>. AbbVie believes people living with migraine should have access to all new medications for this debilitating disease.

<h3><b><i>AstraZeneca will advance and accelerate ongoing Phase III clinical development of CAEL-101, a potential first-in-class medicine for AL amyloidosis
</i></b></h3>
</div>

<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca’s Alexion has exercised its option to acquire all remaining equity in Caelum Biosciences for CAEL-101, a potentially first-in-class fibril-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the treatment of light chain (AL) amyloidosis.

AL amyloidosis is a rare disease in which misfolded amyloid proteins build up in organs throughout the body, including the heart and kidneys, causing significant organ damage and failure that may ultimately be fatal.<sup>1,2</sup> <a id=""_Hlk83641238"" name=""_Hlk83641238""></a>Approximately 20,000 people across the US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK live with AL amyloidosis classified as Mayo stage IIIa or IIIb disease.<sup>3</sup>

CAEL-101 is currently being evaluated in the Cardiac Amyloid Reaching for Extended Survival (CARES) Phase III clinical programme in combination with standard-of-care (SoC) therapy in AL amyloidosis. Two parallel Phase III trials in patients with Mayo stage IIIa disease and in patients with Mayo stage IIIb disease respectively are ongoing.<sup>4,5</sup>

Marc Dunoyer, Chief Executive Officer, Alexion, said: “With a median survival time of less than 18 months following diagnosis, there is an urgent need for new treatments for this devastating disease. CAEL-101 has the potential to be the first therapy to target and remove amyloid deposits from organ tissues, improve organ function, and, ultimately, lead to longer lives for these patients.”

<b>Financial considerations
</b>In 2019 Caelum and Alexion first entered into a collaboration whereby Alexion acquired a minority equity interest and an exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity in Caelum. Alexion currently consolidates Caelum and reflects a non-controlling interest of $150m. Upon closing the acquisition, which is expected to take place on 5 October 2021, Alexion will pay Caelum the agreed option exercise price of approximately $150m, with the potential for additional payments of up to $350m upon achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones.

<b>AL amyloidosis
</b>AL amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by defective plasma cells in the bone marrow that produce abnormal antibody (immunoglobulin) proteins.<sup>1</sup> These abnormal proteins misfold and aggregate to form amyloids that may deposit in tissues and/or organs.<sup>1,2</sup> Amyloid accumulation in organs, particularly in the heart and kidneys, can cause widespread and progressive organ damage and high mortality rates, with death most frequently occurring as a result of cardiac failure.<sup>1,2</sup>

<b>CAEL-101
</b>CAEL-101 is a potentially first-in-class mAb designed to improve organ function by reducing or eliminating amyloid deposits in the tissues and organs of patients with AL amyloidosis. The antibody is designed to bind to misfolded light chain proteins and amyloid and shows binding to both kappa and lambda subtypes. CAEL-101 has received Orphan Drug Designation from both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission as a potential therapy for patients with AL amyloidosis. Additionally, the US FDA granted Fast Track Designation to CAEL-101 for AL amyloidosis in June 2021.

<b>CARES Phase III clinical programme
</b>The CARES clinical programme consists of two parallel global Phase III trials which are evaluating the efficacy and safety of CAEL-101 in AL amyloidosis patients who are newly diagnosed and naïve to SoC treatment (<a id=""_Hlk83374773"" name=""_Hlk83374773""></a><a id=""_Hlk83374967"" name=""_Hlk83374967""></a>based on a cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone regimen). One trial is enrolling approximately 270 patients with Mayo stage IIIa disease and one trial is enrolling approximately 110 patients with Mayo stage IIIb disease. The primary endpoint for both clinical trials is overall survival and enrolment is underway.

In each study, participants are being randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either CAEL-101 plus SoC or placebo plus SoC once weekly for four weeks. This will be followed by a maintenance dose administered every two weeks until the last patient enrolled completes at least 50 weeks of treatment. Patients will continue follow-up visits every 12 weeks and will subsequently be enrolled in an open-label extension study.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”), with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, today presented three-year results from the TANGO study at IDWeek 2021, being held virtually 29 September - 3 October. Findings showed that the 2-drug regimen (2DR) Dovato (dolutegravir/lamivudine) continued to demonstrate non-inferior efficacy and a high barrier to resistance compared to continuation of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF)-based regimens of at least three drugs in virologically suppressed adults living with HIV-1 who had not experienced prior virologic failure.<sup>1</sup> At three years, no participants on dolutegravir/lamivudine (0% [0/369]) met confirmed protocol-defined virologic failure, versus three participants (&lt;1% [3/372]) on the TAF-based regimen. No resistance mutations were reported in either arm.<sup>1</sup>

<b>Olayemi Osiyemi,</b> <b>M.D., Founder, CEO, and President of Triple O Medical Services and Triple O Research Institute P.A., United States, lead author and one of the investigators of the TANGO study, said:</b> “These data provide us with further long-term evidence that switching virologically supressed people living with HIV from TAF-based 3-drug regimens to dolutegravir/lamivudine will not only maintain virologic suppression, but offers a treatment option consisting of fewer medicines. As we now consider HIV a long-term condition requiring life-long medication, these results give physicians the data they need to have more confidence in switching their virologically suppressed patients who are taking three or more medicines. Additionally, these data show no confirmed virologic failures, which is important over a long-term study.”

These findings demonstrated the non-inferiority of dolutegravir/lamivudine compared to continuation of TAF-based regimens in the Intention to Treat-Exposed (ITT-E) population (defined as all participants randomised to the study), based on the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA =50 copies per millilitre (c/mL) at Week 144 (Snapshot virologic failure: 0.3% [1/369] vs 1.3% [5/372]; adjusted difference: -1.1% [95% CI: -2.4%, 0.2%] for the dolutegravir/lamivudine and TAF-based regimen arms, respectively).<sup>1</sup>

In the ITT-E population, both treatment arms showed a high proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL, with dolutegravir/lamivudine demonstrating non-inferior virologic suppression to the TAF-based regimen (85.9% [317/369] vs 81.7% [304/372], respectively; adjusted difference: 4.2% [95% CI: -1.1%, 9.5%]).<sup>1</sup>

<b>Kimberly Smith, M.D., MPH, Head of Research &amp; Development at ViiV Healthcare, said: </b>“The latest results from the TANGO study further reinforce Dovato’s role in the HIV treatment landscape, allowing people living with HIV to maintain virologic suppression over the long-term with fewer medicines.”

Overall adverse event (AE) rates were similar between the study arms, with more drug-related grade 2-5 AEs with dolutegravir/lamivudine versus the TAF-based regimens arm (6% [21/369]) vs 4% [13/371], respectively).<sup>1</sup> Rates of AEs were similar between treatment arms at Weeks 48, 96 and 144. The most common drug-related grade 2-5 AEs in the dolutegravir/lamivudine and TAF-based regimens arms were insomnia (1% [4/369] vs 0% [0/371]), increased weight (&lt;1% [3/369] vs &lt;1% [3/371]), constipation (&lt;1% [2/369] vs &lt;1% [1/371]), depression (&lt;1% [2/369] vs &lt;1% [1/371]), flatulence (&lt;1% [2/369] vs 0% [0/371]) and nausea (0% [0/369] vs &lt;1% [2/371]).<sup>1</sup> As with the findings at Weeks 48 and 96, changes in fasting lipids generally favoured dolutegravir/lamivudine.<sup>1</sup> Decreases in total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides were observed in the dolutegravir/lamivudine arm, compared to increases in the TAF-based regimens arm, while very small changes in TC/HDL ratio were seen across both treatment arms.<sup>1</sup> At Week 144, proximal tubular renal function markers were comparable across the two treatment arms.<sup>1</sup>

<b>About TANGO<sup>2</sup></b>

TANGO is a phase III, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre study to assess the antiviral efficacy and safety of switching to a 2-drug regimen (2DR) consisting of dolutegravir/lamivudine in HIV-infected adults who are virologically suppressed and stable on a tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF)-based regimen.

Study participants were HIV-1 infected adults on TAF-based regimens with HIV-1 RNA&lt;50 c/mL for at least six months, without prior virologic failure, no historical nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) or integrase inhibitor (INSTI) major resistance mutation, and no evidence of hepatitis B infection. Participants were randomised to switch to dolutegravir/lamivudine or continue on the TAF-based regimens through Week 148. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with a viral load of &gt;50 c/mL at Week 48 (FDA Snapshot algorithm) for the Intention to Treat-Exposed (ITT-E) population. Secondary endpoints included efficacy at Weeks 96 and 144 in the ITT-E and Per Protocol (PP) populations.

<b>About Dovato (dolutegravir/lamivudine)<sup>3,4</sup></b>

Dovato is a once-daily, single-pill, 2-drug regimen (2DR) that combines the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) dolutegravir (Tivicay, 50 mg) with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) lamivudine (Epivir, 300 mg).

Dovato (dolutegravir 50 mg/lamivudine 300 mg tablets) is authorised in the EU for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg, with no known or suspected resistance to the INSTI class, or lamivudine. In the US, Dovato is indicated as a complete regimen to treat HIV-1 infection in adults with no antiretroviral (ARV) treatment history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known resistance to any component of Dovato.

Dovato uses two medicines, instead of the traditional three, to inhibit the viral life cycle at two different sites. INSTIs, like dolutegravir, inhibit HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection. Lamivudine is an NRTI that works by interfering with the conversion of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which in turn stops the virus from multiplying.

Dovato is approved in the US, Europe, Japan, Australia and other countries worldwide.

Trademarks are owned by or licensed to the ViiV Healthcare group of companies.

<b>Important Safety Information for Dovato (50mg dolutegravir/300mg lamivudine) Tablets</b>

<b>INDICATION</b>

DOVATO is indicated as a complete regimen to treat HIV-1 infection in adults with no antiretroviral (ARV) treatment history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known resistance to any component of DOVATO.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>BOXED WARNING: PATIENTS CO-INFECTED WITH HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) AND HIV-1: EMERGENCE OF LAMIVUDINE-RESISTANT HBV AND EXACERBATIONS OF HBV</b>

All patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of HBV prior to or when initiating DOVATO. Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. If DOVATO is used in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, additional treatment should be considered for appropriate treatment of chronic HBV; otherwise, consider an alternative regimen.

Severe acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported in patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued lamivudine, a component of DOVATO. Closely monitor hepatic function in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-HBV treatment.

<b>Contraindications</b>

· Do not use DOVATO in patients with previous hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir or lamivudine

· Do not use DOVATO in patients receiving dofetilide

<b>Warnings and precautions</b>

Hypersensitivity Reactions:

· Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with dolutegravir and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury

· Discontinue DOVATO immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop, as a delay in stopping treatment may result in a life-threatening reaction. Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated

Hepatotoxicity:

· Hepatic adverse events have been reported, including cases of hepatic toxicity (elevated serum liver biochemistries, hepatitis, and acute liver failure), in patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen without pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors

· Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of DOVATO. In some cases, the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or hepatitis B reactivation, particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn

· Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended

Embryo Fetal Toxicity:

· Assess the risks and benefits of DOVATO and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of neural tube defects

· Pregnancy testing is recommended before initiation of DOVATO. Individuals of childbearing potential should be counseled on the consistent use of effective contraception

Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis:

Fatal cases have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including lamivudine. Discontinue DOVATO if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity develop, including hepatomegaly and steatosis in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.

Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions with concomitant use of DOVATO and other drugs may occur (see Contraindications and Drug interactions).

Immune Reconstitution Syndrome, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, has been reported with the use of DOVATO.

<b>Adverse reactions</b>

The most common adverse reactions (incidence =2%, all grades) with DOVATO were headache (3%), nausea (2%), diarrhea (2%), insomnia (2%), fatigue (2%), and anxiety (2%).

<b>Drug interactions</b>

· Consult full Prescribing Information for DOVATO for more information on potentially significant drug interactions

· DOVATO is a complete regimen. Coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended

· Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A or UGT1A1 may affect the plasma concentrations of dolutegravir

· Administer DOVATO 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking polyvalent cation-containing antacids or laxatives, sucralfate, oral supplements containing iron or calcium, or buffered medications. Alternatively, DOVATO and supplements containing calcium or iron can be taken with food

<b>Use in specific populations</b>

· Pregnancy: There are insufficient human data on the use of DOVATO during pregnancy to definitively assess a drug-associated risk for birth defects and miscarriage. An Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Advise individuals of childbearing potential of the potential risk of neural tube defects. Assess the risks and benefits of DOVATO and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester

· Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended due to the potential for HIV-1 transmission, developing viral resistance in HIV-positive infants, and adverse reactions in a breastfed infant

· Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing is recommended before initiation of DOVATO. Counsel individuals of childbearing potential taking DOVATO on the consistent use of effective contraception

· Renal Impairment: DOVATO is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min. Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min should be monitored for hematologic toxicities, which may require a dosage adjustment of lamivudine as an individual component

· Hepatic Impairment: DOVATO is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C)

Novartis, a leader in immuno-dermatology and rheumatology, today announced new analysis from a Phase IIb study demonstrating the importance of achieving complete control of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) symptoms in improving overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients<sup>1</sup>. Complete control of symptoms brings enormous benefit to people with CSU and is associated with improvements in key HRQoL measures such as overall quality of life, sleep interference, activity interference and work impairment<sup>1,3</sup>. There is a marked decline in these improvements to quality of life even when patients are living with only a low level of CSU symptoms<sup>1</sup>.

Complete control of CSU symptoms was assessed by a composite of patient reported outcomes (PROs) and was shown to be more likely achieved and sustained with ligelizumab than Xolair<sup>®</sup> (omalizumab) or placebo<sup>2</sup>. These data were presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 30th Anniversary Congress.

CSU is a severe and unpredictable disease of the skin, affecting up to 1% of the global population at any time<sup>4</sup>. When compared with the general population, patients with CSU are twice as likely to experience difficulty sleeping, anxiety, distress and depression<sup>5-7</sup>. Many people with CSU do not achieve complete control of signs and symptoms despite using standard-of-care treatments (antihistamines and omalizumab)<sup>1,4,8</sup>.

The data show that ligelizumab was more likely to provide complete control of CSU symptoms than omalizumab when assessed using a composite of PROs<sup>2</sup>. A patient free from signs and symptoms of urticaria with concurrent hive severity score (HSS7)=0, itch severity score (ISS7)=0 and angioedema activity score (AAS7)=0 was considered to have CSU completely controlled. Concurrent Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)=0-1 indicated a patient being CSU free<sup>2</sup>:
<ul>
 	<li>At Week 12, the proportion of patients showing CSU completely controlled was 44.1% with ligelizumab 72 mg (<em>P</em>=0.007 vs omalizumab, and <em>P</em>=0.003 vs placebo), 40.0% with ligelizumab 240 mg (<em>P</em>=0.025 vs omalizumab, and <em>P</em>=0.004 vs placebo), 23.5% with omalizumab (<em>P</em>=0.021 vs placebo) and 0.0% with placebo. The proportion of CSU-free patients was 38.1% with ligelizumab 72 mg (<em>P</em>=0.008 vs omalizumab, and <em>P</em>=0.006 vs placebo), 35.3% with ligelizumab 240 mg (<em>P</em>=0.020 vs omalizumab, and <em>P</em>=0.007 vs placebo), 18.8% with omalizumab (<em>P</em>=0.035 vs placebo) and 0.0% with placebo.</li>
 	<li>At Week 20, the proportion of patients with CSU completely controlled was 33.3%, 34.1%, 25.9% and 4.7%, and for CSU-free patients was 32.1%, 31.8%, 23.5% and 4.7% for ligelizumab 72 mg, 240 mg, omalizumab and placebo, respectively.</li>
 	<li>During the treatment-free follow-up period, at Week 28, the proportion of patients remaining CSU free for ligelizumab 72 mg, 240 mg, omalizumab and placebo was 22.8%, 25.0%, 5.3% and 4.9%, respectively.</li>
</ul>
“Novartis is committed to the discovery and development of medicines that can ease the burden of immuno-dermatological diseases, which impact more than 100 million people worldwide,” said Angelika Jahreis M.D., Ph.D., Novartis Global Head Development Unit Immunology, Hepatology &amp; Dermatology. “These Phase II results are encouraging as they speak to the benefits of symptom control as reported directly by patients. This is particularly revealing as we know that established methods of assessing disease impact such as the Urticaria Activity Score of 7 days (UAS7) can sometimes fail to capture a patient’s entire experience of living with CSU.”

Novartis will also present late-breaking Phase II data for remibrutinib in CSU, showing that multiple doses provide significant improvements from baseline versus placebo with a favorable safety profile across the entire dose range. Remibrutinib is being investigated as a potential oral treatment across a number of immune-mediated conditions.

<em>Lay summaries for the Phase IIb ligelizumab data and other key abstracts presented at EADV 2021 are available from the Novartis website: </em><a title="""" href=""https://www.novartis.com/our-focus/immunology-dermatology/abstract-summaries-eadv"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><strong><em>https://www.novartis.com/our-focus/immunology-dermatology/abstract-summaries-eadv</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong>

<strong>Novartis in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)</strong>
Novartis is curious about the science beneath the skin and dedicated to reimagining the care of patients with diseases that can severely limit quality of life such as CSU, psoriasis, acne, and atopic dermatitis. Novartis is committed to developing medicines that will advance the treatment of CSU, so patients are able to live their lives without the distressing and unpredictable symptoms of this debilitating disease. These include ligelizumab (QGE031) a next generation high-affinity monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibody and remibrutinib (LOU064) a potentially best-in-class oral BTK inhibitor. It is intended that these investigational therapies will complement Xolair, our existing approved add-on therapy for CSU.

In the US, Novartis and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. Outside the US, Novartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs.

<strong>About ligelizumab</strong>
Ligelizumab (QGE031) is a next generation high-affinity monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibody. Ligelizumab is thought to work by blocking the IgE/FceRI pathway, a key driver of the inflammatory process in CSU<sup>9,10</sup>. In a Phase IIb dose-finding trial, more patients experienced complete resolution of wheals (hives) with ligelizumab compared with Xolair<sup>®</sup> (omalizumab)<sup>11</sup>. No safety concerns were found with ligelizumab compared with omalizumab or placebo in a Phase IIb dose-finding trial in CSU patients with inadequate control on antihistamines<sup>11</sup>. Ligelizumab compared with omalizumab is currently being investigated in ongoing Phase III clinical trials including PEARL 1 and PEARL 2 (NCT03580369 and NCT03580356). The clinical trials have recruited more than 2,000 patients globally across 48 countries and results are expected in the second half of 2021<sup>12,13</sup>.

Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced it has received CE Mark approval for its radial artery access portfolio, which includes the Rist™ 079 Radial Access Guide Catheter and Rist™ Radial Access Selective Catheter.

The Rist 079 Radial Access Guide Catheter is the first catheter specifically designed for the unique demands of accessing the neuro vasculature through the radial artery versus access through the transfemoral artery. 510(K) cleared by United States Food and Drug Administration<sup>1</sup>, the product has been in use at limited sites in the U.S. and received strong customer feedback in over 100 cases on its outperformance in navigability and support for the radial pathway.

""With excellent navigability, this first-of-its-kind device will allow clinicians to reach distal locations while still achieving excellent stability to the system,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Alejandro Tomasello</span>, head of Interventional Neuroradiology Unit at Vall d'Hebron Hospital, <span class=""xn-location"">Barcelona, Spain</span>. ""The radial artery-access portfolio works well in tandem with Phenom™ PLUS, Phenom™ 021 microcatheter for stent deployment or Phenom™ 027 microcatheter for flow diverter deployment, which is a fantastic set up for Pipeline™ VANTAGE Embolization Device with Shield Technology™ treatments.""

Transradial techniques are now the standard of care in the cardiac interventional community since the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3292776-1&amp;h=1066921841&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ahajournals.org%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1161%2FHCV.0000000000000035&amp;a=American+Heart+Association"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">American Heart Association<span class=""accessible-message"">(opens new window)</span></a> recommended a radial-first approach for acute coronary syndrome in 2018 citing lower bleeding and vascular complications than transfemoral artery access<sup>2,3</sup>. Other advantages demonstrated in cardiovascular procedures to radial access include strong patient preference<sup>4</sup>, immediate ambulation and reduced costs<sup>5,6</sup>, which have led the neuro-interventionalist community to examine adoption of the transradial approach to their practice.

""We are committed to exploring ways to improve outcomes through complication reduction, reducing the cost of care and improving the overall patient experience. We believe radial access is a meaningful addition to the clinical armamentarium,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Dan Volz</span>, president of the Neurovascular Therapies business, which is part of the Neuroscience Portfolio at Medtronic. ""The CE Mark approval of the Rist radial access portfolio emphasizes our focus on driving innovation that gives clinicians who perform neurovascular procedures the broadest product portfolio so they can customize their care based on a patient's condition and anatomy.""

<b>About the Trial<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated REGEN-COV in non-hospitalized adult patients who had detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection when they entered the trial (measured by nasopharyngeal samples by PCR). All patients evaluated for efficacy had at least one risk factor for progressing to severe COVID-19, such as chronic lung disease (including asthma), obesity, cardiovascular disease or being at least 50 years of age. Patients included in this analysis were randomized into three treatment arms: REGEN-COV 2,400 mg (n=1,355), REGEN-COV 1,200 mg (n=736) and placebo (n=1,341 for 2,400 mg comparator, n=748 for 1,200 mg comparator). After receiving one dose when they entered the trial, patients were then followed for 28 days to assess efficacy and safety.

On average, patients included in the efficacy analysis had experienced symptoms for 3 days. Approximately 37% were Hispanic or Latino and 5% were African American. Patients were on average approximately 50 years of age, 52% were female and 48% were male.

<b>About the REGEN-COV Antibody Cocktail<br class=""dnr"" /></b>REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies that was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, using Regeneron's proprietary <i>VelocImmune<sup>®</sup></i> and <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup></i> technologies. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that form the cocktail bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus's spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in <i><u><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3307266-1&amp;h=2153382497&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell%2Ffulltext%2FS0092-8674(21)00703-0&amp;a=Cell"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Cell</a></u></i> and <i><u><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3307266-1&amp;h=1271248935&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.science.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1126%2Fscience.abd0831&amp;a=Science"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Science</a></u></i>.

REGEN-COV has not been approved by the FDA, but is currently <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3307266-1&amp;h=3645170185&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3248768-1%26h%3D3509491638%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.regeneron.com%252Fdownloads%252Ftreatment-covid19-eua-fact-sheet-for-hcp.pdf%26a%3Dauthorized&amp;a=authorized"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">authorized</a> in the U.S. for the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis in certain high risk individuals. Post-exposure prophylaxis with REGEN-COV is not a substitute for vaccination against COVID-19. REGEN-COV is not authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19 or for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy, or for people currently using chronic oxygen therapy because of an underlying comorbidity who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19. This authorization is for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency uses under section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. Additional information about REGEN-COV in the U.S. is below (authorized uses and important safety information).

In August, Regeneron submitted the first of two Biologics License Applications (BLAs) for REGEN-COV. The initial submission included data on the efficacy and safety of REGEN-COV to treat and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-hospitalized people. The second BLA submission will focus on those hospitalized because of COVID-19, and is expected to be completed later this year.

Emergency or temporary pandemic use authorizations are currently in place in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., several European Union countries, <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Switzerland</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, and the antibody cocktail is fully approved in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> and conditionally approved in the UK.

Regeneron invented REGEN-COV and is <u><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3307266-1&amp;h=3019861572&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3048827-1%26h%3D2782805965%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Finvestor.regeneron.com%252Fnews-releases%252Fnews-release-details%252Fregeneron-and-roche-collaborate-significantly-increase-global%26a%3Dcollaborating&amp;a=collaborating"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">collaborating</a></u> with Roche to increase global supply, with Roche primarily responsible for development and distribution outside the U.S. Regeneron and Roche share a commitment to making the antibody cocktail available to COVID-19 patients around the globe and will support access in low- and lower-middle-income countries through drug donations to be made in partnership with public health organizations.

<b>About Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune</i> Technology<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune</i> technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span> was a graduate student with his mentor <span class=""xn-person"">Frederick W. Alt</span> in 1985, they were the first to <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3307266-1&amp;h=4057568267&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2F0168952585900897&amp;a=envision"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">envision</a> making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing <i>VelocImmune</i> and related <i>VelociSuite</i> technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used <i>VelocImmune</i> technology to create approximately a quarter of all original, FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN–COV (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab), Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab), Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), Evkeeza<sup>®</sup> (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).

 	<li><b><u>Warnings and Precautions</u></b><b>: </b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis and Infusion-Related Reactions:</b> Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed with administration of REGEN-COV. If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions occurring more than 24 hours after the infusion have also been reported with the use of REGEN-COV under EUA. Infusion-related reactions, occurring during the infusion and up to 24 hours after the infusion, have been observed with administration of REGEN-COV. These reactions may be severe or life threatening
<ul>
 	<li><b>Signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions may include</b>: fever, difficulty breathing, reduced oxygen saturation, chills, nausea, arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), chest pain or discomfort, weakness, altered mental status, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, vasovagal reactions (e.g., pre-syncope, syncope), dizziness, fatigue and diaphoresis. Consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care if an infusion-related reaction occurs</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b>Clinical Worsening After REGEN-COV Administration:</b> Clinical worsening of COVID-19 after administration of REGEN-COV has been reported and may include signs or symptoms of fever, hypoxia or increased respiratory difficulty, arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), fatigue, and altered mental status. Some of these events required hospitalization. It is not known if these events were related to REGEN-COV use or were due to progression of COVID-19</li>
 	<li><b>Limitations of Benefit and Potential for Risk in Patients with Severe COVID-19:</b> Monoclonal antibodies, such as REGEN-COV, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Therefore, REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19–related comorbidity</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b><u>Adverse Reactions</u></b><b>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>COV-2067 (Treatment): </b>Infusion-related reactions (adverse event assessed as causally related by the investigator) of grade 2 or higher severity have been observed in 10/4,206 (0.2%) of those who received REGEN-COV at the authorized dose or a higher dose. Three subjects receiving the 8,000 mg dose of REGEN-COV, and one subject receiving the 1,200 mg casirivimab and 1,200 mg imdevimab, had infusion-related reactions (urticaria, pruritus, flushing, pyrexia, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, rash) which resulted in permanent discontinuation of the infusion. All events resolved. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in the clinical program in subjects receiving REGEN-COV. The events began within 1 hour of completion of the infusion, and in at least one case required treatment including epinephrine. The events resolved</li>
 	<li><b>COV-2069 (Post-exposure prophylaxis):</b> In subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline (Cohort A), injection site reactions (all grade 1 and 2) occurred in 55 subjects (4%) in the REGEN-COV group and 19 subjects (2%) in the placebo group. The most common signs and symptoms of injection site reactions which occurred in at least 1% of subjects in the REGEN-COV group were erythema and pruritus. Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 2 subjects (0.2%) in the REGEN-COV group and all hypersensitivity reactions were grade 1 in severity. In subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline (Cohort B), injection site reactions, all of which were grade 1 or 2, occurred in 6 subjects (4%) in the REGEN-COV group and 1 subject (1%) in the placebo group. The most common signs and symptoms of injection site reactions which occurred in at least 1% of subjects in the REGEN-COV group were ecchymosis and erythema</li>
 	<li><b>COV-2093 (Subcutaneous Dosing):</b> Injection site reactions occurred in 12% and 4% of subjects following single dose administration in the REGEN-COV and placebo groups, respectively. Remaining safety finding following subcutaneous administration in the REGEN-COV group were similar to the safety findings observed with intravenous administration in COV-2067. With repeat dosing, injection site reactions occurred in 252 subjects (35%) in the REGEN-COV group and 38 subjects (16%) in the placebo group; all injection site reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 8 subjects (1%) in the REGEN-COV group; and all hypersensitivity reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity. There were no cases of anaphylaxis</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b><u>Patient Monitoring Recommendations</u></b>: Clinically monitor patients during dose administration and observe patients for at least 1 hour after intravenous infusion or subcutaneous dosing is complete</li>
 	<li><b><u>Use in Specific Populations</u></b><b>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Pregnancy:</b> There are insufficient data to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. REGEN-COV should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus</li>
 	<li><b>Lactation:</b> There are no available data on the presence of casirivimab and/or imdevimab in human milk or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for REGEN-COV and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from REGEN-COV or from the underlying maternal condition</li>

The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced the initiation of its Phase 3 EVERGREEN study. The study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Janssen’s investigational adult vaccine against lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), when compared with placebo in approximately 23,000 adults aged 60 years and older throughout North America and a selection of countries across Europe, Asia and the Southern Hemisphere.

The EVERGREEN study was initiated based on positive results from the Phase 2b CYPRESS study, the first large <span class=""Link"">study evaluating the efficacy and safety </span>of Janssen’s investigational RSV vaccine against RSV-associated LRTD in vaccinated adults aged 65 and older in the United States.

Efficacy and immunogenicity data from the Phase 2b CYPRESS study will be presented at the virtual IDWeek 2021 taking place from September 29 – October 3 (Abstract #1106286).

“Positive data from our first RSV vaccine efficacy study and the initiation of the Phase 3 EVERGREEN study are crucial milestones in the clinical development of our investigational RSV adult vaccine, which has the potential to safely and effectively prevent lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in older adults,” says Penny Heaton, M.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Vaccines, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. “With no vaccine or broadly-indicated antiviral treatment available, preventive solutions to address the significant morbidity and mortality in older adults caused by RSV have long been an unmet need.”

Older adults are at high risk of developing <span class=""Link"">a serious infection from RSV, a</span> highly contagious, potentially life-threatening respiratory virus affecting more than 64 million people worldwide in a typical year, across all age groups.<a class=""Link "" href=""https://www.jnj.com/janssen-announces-start-of-phase-3-trial-for-investigational-respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv-vaccine-in-older-adults#_edn1"" aria-label=""[1]"" data-cms-ai=""0"">[1]</a>

In September 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted <a class=""Link "" href=""https://www.jnj.com/janssen-announces-u-s-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-investigational-prophylactic-vaccine-for-the-prevention-of-respiratory-syncytial-virus-in-older-adults"" aria-label=""Breakthrough Therapy Designation"" data-cms-ai=""0"">Breakthrough Therapy Designation</a> for Janssen’s investigational RSV adult vaccine for the prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in adults aged 60 years or older. This was based on clinical data indicating the potential for substantial improvement compared to available standard of care on a clinically significant endpoint(s). In November 2020, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use designated Janssen’s investigational RSV adult vaccine as eligible for the priority medicines (PRIME) scheme based on promising clinical data and an unmet need for a prophylactic option to prevent RSV in older adults.

<b>About Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)</b>
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a prevalent, highly contagious respiratory virus and a leading cause of bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia, affecting more than 64 million people worldwide in a typical year. Because the symptoms of RSV can be difficult to distinguish from influenza or other respiratory infections, such as COVID-19, many who are infected with RSV remain undiagnosed.

Older adults, young children and those with underlying health conditions are most at risk. RSV disproportionately impacts adults over 60 years and high-risk adults over 18 years who are more likely to develop a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Between 3-7 percent of older adults (age 60 and older) and 4-10 percent of high-risk adults (age 18 and older) experience RSV in a typical year.

With no preventive vaccine or effective antiviral treatment available, RSV remains a major global public health concern and is a substantial health and economic burden globally.

<b>About CYPRESS (NCT03982199)</b>
CYPRESS (NCT03982199) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial. The trial enrolled 5,782 participants (2,891 in each study arm) aged 65 years and older. The participants were randomized 1:1 prior to the RSV season to receive Janssen’s investigational RSV adult vaccine or placebo. Immunogenicity and safety assessments were performed in a subset of approximately 200 and 695 participants, respectively. Disease symptoms were collected through a questionnaire and/or by a clinician’s assessment. For further information, please see: <a class=""Link "" href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03982199"" aria-label=""https:clinicaltrials.govct2showNCT03982199"" data-cms-ai=""0"">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03982199</a>

<b>About EVERGREEN (NCT04908683)</b>
The EVERGREEN study (NCT04908683) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 efficacy study, which aims to confirm the efficacy of the vaccine candidate in the prevention of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) when compared to placebo in adults aged 60 years and older. The clinical trial is being conducted in countries in North America, Europe, Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Trial participants will be randomized to receive either one dose of active investigational vaccine or placebo. After a year, participants who received the active vaccine will be re-randomized to receive either the active vaccine again, or placebo. Participants will be followed for at least two RSV seasons.

The OCS Liver System is indicated for the preservation and monitoring of hemodynamics and metabolic function which allows for ex-vivo assement of liver allografts from DBD and DCD donor livers. This indication is based on the results of the OCS Liver PROTECT Trial.

""We are extremely proud of this approval of our OCS Liver technology, as it represents the first and only liver perfusion technology to be approved by the FDA in the United States,"" said Waleed Hassanein, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""TransMedics is now uniquely positioned to offer its OCS perfusion technology for lung, heart and liver transplantion. Our goal is to leverage these FDA approvals to make more donor organs available to help patients in need of the life saving transplant procedure. We are looking forward to expanding our commercial activities with all three OCS Systems starting in the fourth quarter of 2021.""

""I am convinced that broad availability of warm extracoporeal donor liver perfusion will be the most important advance for the field of liver transplantation in decades,"" said Dr. James F. Markmann, Chief of the Division of Transplation Surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Principal investigator of the OCS Liver PROTECT Trial. ""The OCS Liver has the potential to save many lives by making liver transplants safer and by expanding the pool of available liver allografts.""

Hunter syndrome is caused by a deficiency of IDS and manifests in different forms. JR-141, applied with J-Brain Cargo®, JCR’s proprietary blood-brain barrier (BBB) technology, is engineered to transport the therapeutic enzyme across the BBB to directly reach the brain and address both the somatic and neuronopathic manifestations of the disease, which can lead to progressive cognitive decline.

Under the terms of the exclusive collaboration and license agreement, Takeda will exclusively commercialize JR-141 outside of the United States, including Canada, Europe, and other regions (excluding Japan and certain other Asia-Pacific countries). JCR will receive an upfront payment for such ex-U.S. license, and is eligible to receive additional development and commercial milestones as well as tiered royalties on potential sales. The two companies will collaborate to bring this therapy to patients as quickly as possible upon completion of the global Phase 3 program, which will be conducted by JCR.

Takeda receives an option under a separate option agreement, which allows Takeda to acquire an exclusive license to commercialize JR-141 in the U.S. upon completion of the Phase 3 program.

“Takeda is committed to continuously improving the way Hunter syndrome is treated. JR-141 introduces a new way to deliver proteins across the blood-brain barrier, overcoming our current challenges to treat the underlying neuronopathic manifestations of Hunter syndrome and help maintain or improve cognitive function in these patients,” said Dan Curran, M.D., Head, Rare Genetics &amp; Hematology Therapeutic Area Unit at Takeda. “We will work closely with JCR to apply our expertise in enzyme replacement therapies with the hope of bringing this potentially transformative therapy to patients as quickly as possible.”

“JCR is pleased to have reached an agreement with Takeda who is well placed to achieve our common goal of maximizing the impact of JR-141,” said Shin Ashida, President, Chairman of JCR. “Our mission is to provide transformative treatment options as soon as possible to patients with lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) with central nervous system symptoms, such as Hunter syndrome. JR-141 is the first-ever approved biopharmaceutical in Japan that penetrates the blood-brain barrier. I expect that we will be able to achieve this mission through our partnership with Takeda to deliver a new treatment option to Hunter patients around the world as swiftly as possible.”

JR-141 met its primary endpoint in an open-label <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fssl4.eir-parts.net%2Fdoc%2F4552%2Ftdnet%2F1946438%2F00.pdf&amp;esheet=52500846&amp;newsitemid=20210930005353&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Phase+2%2F3+clinical+trial+in+Japan&amp;index=3&amp;md5=addd577c8b605c0b8ff05fad71ac4186"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Phase 2/3 clinical trial in Japan</a> demonstrating significant reductions in heparan sulfate (HS) in the cerebrospinal fluid, a biomarker for assessing the drug’s effectiveness in reducing disease-causing substrate in the central nervous system, in all subjects for whom measurements were available after 52 weeks of treatment. Somatic disease control was maintained in patients who switched from standard enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The study also demonstrated an improvement in somatic symptoms in participants who had not previously received standard ERT prior to the start of the trial. Additionally, a neurocognitive development assessment demonstrated maintenance or improvement of age-equivalent function in 21 of the 25 patients at one year. There were no reports of serious treatment-related adverse events in the trial.<sup>1</sup>

<strong>About JR-141</strong>

JR-141 is a recombinant fusion protein of an antibody against the human transferrin receptor and iduronate-2-sulfatase, the enzyme that is missing or malfunctioning in subjects with Hunter syndrome. It is expected to be effective against the neuronopathic manifestations of the disease by crossing the BBB through transferrin receptor mediated transcytosis using J-Brain Cargo®, JCR’s proprietary BBB technology. Uptake into cells is mediated through the transferrin receptor and mannose-6-phosphate receptor. JCR has advanced development activities by establishing the necessary evidence from the molecular design stage to the nonclinical and clinical trial phases. In non-clinical trials, JCR has confirmed both high affinity binding of JR-141 to transferrin receptors, and passage across the BBB into neuronal cells as evidenced by electron microscopy.

In addition, JCR has confirmed that using J-Brain Cargo® technology, enzymes are taken up into various brain tissues. A decrease in substrate accumulation has also been confirmed in an animal model of Hunter syndrome.<sup>2,3,4</sup> In several clinical trials with JR-141, JCR obtained evidence of reduction of heparan sulfate concentrations in the CSF, a biomarker for assessing the drug’s effectiveness in reducing disease-causing substrate in the central nervous system, consistent with the results obtained from non-clinical studies. JCR also obtained clinical results that demonstrate positive effects of JR-141 on neurocognition.<sup>5,6,7,8</sup>

JR-141 was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and marketed since May 2021 under the brand name “IZCARGO® I.V. Infusion 10mg.”

<strong>About Hunter Syndrome</strong>

Hunter syndrome is a severely debilitating, rare lysosomal disease caused by a deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase, an enzyme that is needed to break down substances in the body called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).<sup>9</sup> Without this enzyme, GAGs can build up, causing a range of disease-related signs and symptoms.<sup>9,10</sup> Roughly two of every three patients with Hunter syndrome are also affected with progressive cognitive decline.<sup>11</sup> Hunter syndrome affects 1 in 162,000 total live births, and almost exclusively males.<sup>12</sup>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Tirzepatide led to greater improvements in liver fat content and abdominal adipose tissue compared to titrated insulin degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes in an MRI sub-study of Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) phase 3 SURPASS-3 clinical trial.1 The results were presented today at the 57th European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting in an EASD-sponsored symposium.

The MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) sub-study achieved its primary and secondary endpoints. As evaluated by MRI scans, the sub-study showed all three doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg) led to greater reductions in liver fat content compared to insulin degludec and reductions in volume of visceral adipose tissue and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue compared to increases in volume of both measurements with insulin degludec at 52 weeks.

“Increased ectopic fat – such as liver fat or visceral adipose tissue – is commonly seen in adults with type 2 diabetes and is associated with an inflammatory response and increased cardiometabolic risk,” said Amalia Gastaldelli, Ph.D., Research Director of Cardiometabolic Risk Unit, Institute of Clinical Physiology, CNR, Pisa Italy. “We are encouraged by the robust reductions in liver fat content and abdominal adipose tissue observed with all three doses of tirzepatide in this population of adults with type 2 diabetes and elevated liver fat content.”

Tirzepatide is a novel investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single molecule, representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

SURPASS-3 was a 52-week, multi-center, randomized, phase 3, open-label trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared to titrated insulin degludeci in adults with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control on stable doses of metformin with or without an SGLT-2 inhibitor. Study participants were insulin-naïve and had a mean duration of diabetes of 8.4 years, a baseline A1C of 8.17 percent and a baseline weight of 94.3 kg.

The SURPASS-3 MRI sub-study compared the effect of tirzepatide to titrated insulin degludec on liver fat content (LFC), volume of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT) in 296 participants as evaluated by MRI scans at baseline and at 52 weeks. The subpopulation of adults with type 2 diabetes who participated in this sub-study had an overall baseline LFC of 15.7 percent.

Results among participants taking tirzepatide at 52 weeks showed:

Greater absolute reduction from baseline in LFC for pooled 10 mg and 15 mg arms (-8.09% from 15.67% at baseline) compared to insulin degludec (-3.38% from 16.58% at baseline), the primary endpoint.
Greater relative reduction from baseline in LFC (29.78%-47.11% across the three doses) compared to 11.17% for insulin degludec.
The majority of participants taking tirzepatide achieved at least a 30% reduction in LFC from baseline (66.9%-81.4% across the three doses) compared to a third of those taking insulin degludec (32.12%).
Up to -1.65 liter (L) reduction from baseline of 6.81 L in VAT (15 mg) and -2.25 L reduction from baseline of 10.21 L in ASAT (10 mg) compared to an increase with insulin degludec (+0.38 L from 6.34 L baseline and +0.63 L from 10.04 L baseline respectively).
The overall safety profile of tirzepatide in SURPASS-3 was similar to the well-established GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Gastrointestinal side effects were the most commonly reported adverse events and decreased with continued dosing.

“In this study, we found that more than twice as many participants taking tirzepatide experienced greater than 30 percent reduction in liver fat content compared to those taking insulin degludec,” said Laura Fernández Landó, M.D., senior medical director, Lilly Diabetes. “The results provide us with a deeper understanding of the potential metabolic benefits of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes and we look forward to continuing to study the effects of tirzepatide beyond glucose and weight control alone.”

About tirzepatide
Tirzepatide is a once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single novel molecule. GIP is a hormone that may complement the effects of GLP-1. In preclinical models, GIP has been shown to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure therefore resulting in weight reductions, and when combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, may result in greater effects on glucose and body weight. Tirzepatide is in phase 3 development for blood glucose management in adults with type 2 diabetes and for chronic weight management. It is also being studied as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

About the SURPASS-3 sub-studies and the SURPASS clinical trial program
Lilly developed two sub-studies in order to assess additional glycemic control measures and the effect on liver fat content and abdominal adipose tissue in SURPASS-3, a 52-week randomized, phase 3, open-label trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared to titrated insulin degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control on stable doses of metformin with or without an SGLT-2 inhibitor. In SURPASS-3, the mean starting dose of insulin degludec was 10 units per day. The insulin dose was titrated following a treat-to-target algorithm with the goal of fasting blood glucose below 90 mg/dL.

The SURPASS-3 MRI sub-study compared the effect of tirzepatide to titrated insulin degludec on liver fat content (LFC), volume of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT) as evaluated by MRI scans in a subpopulation of SURPASS-3 trial participants. The subpopulation were adults with type 2 diabetes that had a higher risk of elevated LFC as measured by having a Fatty Liver Index =60. A total of 296 participants were enrolled in this sub-study and randomized to receive either tirzepatide doses of 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg or insulin degludec. The primary objective was to compare the effect of tirzepatide (pooled 10 mg and 15 mg) on change from baseline in the percentage of LFC compared to insulin degludec as measured by MRI scans at baseline and at 52 weeks. The secondary objectives included comparing tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg versus insulin degludec in the proportion of participants achieving LFC =10%; the proportion of participants with a relative decrease from baseline in LFC =30%; the volume of abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and the change from baseline.

The SURPASS phase 3 global clinical development program for tirzepatide has enrolled more than 20,000 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, five of which are global registration studies. The program began in late 2018, and all five global registration trials have been completed.

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Nasdaq: XLRN), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire Acceleron for $180 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $11.5 billion.

Acceleron is focused on harnessing the power of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of proteins that is known to play a central role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and repair. Acceleron’s lead therapeutic candidate, sotatercept, has a novel mechanism of action with the potential to improve short-term and/or long-term clinical outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a progressive and life-threatening blood vessel disorder. Sotatercept is in Phase 3 trials as add-on to current standard of care for the treatment of PAH.

“Strategic business development is a top priority for Merck as we look to drive sustainable growth and further bolster and balance our pipeline with breakthrough science,” said Rob Davis, chief executive officer and president, Merck. “Acceleron’s innovative research has yielded an exciting late-stage candidate that complements and strengthens our growing cardiovascular portfolio and pipeline and holds the potential to build upon Merck’s proud legacy in cardiovascular disease.”

In addition to sotatercept, Acceleron’s portfolio includes REBLOZYL<sup>®</sup> (luspatercept-aamt), a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein approved in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders. REBLOZYL is being developed and commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb.

“This agreement with Merck represents the culmination of decades of work by Acceleron researchers successfully leveraging our company’s deep scientific expertise in the biology of the TGF-beta superfamily and driven by an unwavering dedication to delivering life-changing medicines for patients,” said Habib Dable, chief executive officer and president, Acceleron. “We believe Merck is well-positioned to apply its industry-leading clinical and commercial capabilities to harness the potential of sotatercept as we join together to help make an impact on cardiopulmonary disease for the benefit of patients.”

Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Acceleron. The closing of the tender offer will be subject to certain conditions, including the tender of shares representing at least a majority of the total number of Acceleron’s outstanding shares, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer, Merck’s acquisition subsidiary will be merged into Acceleron, and any remaining shares of common stock of Acceleron will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the same $180 per share price payable in the tender offer. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021.

<b>About Sotatercept</b>

Sotatercept is an investigational reverse-remodeling agent proposed to rebalance TGF-beta superfamily signaling. In preclinical models of PAH, sotatercept reversed pulmonary arterial wall and right ventricular remodeling that are hallmarks of the disease. A Phase 2 trial (PULSAR) evaluating sotatercept in combination with approved PAH-specific medicines in patients with PAH met its primary endpoint of improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance. The study results were published in the <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2024277&amp;esheet=52501144&amp;newsitemid=20210930005314&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=New+England+Journal+of+Medicine&amp;index=2&amp;md5=f4cb167dc9efc074e742aecee94f7d91"" rel=""nofollow""><i>New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>. Sotatercept is being studied in multiple Phase 3 trials for the treatment of certain patients with PAH as well as a Phase 2 trial in patients with combined post- and pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designations and the European Commission and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted Orphan and Priority Medicines (PRIME) designations, respectively, for sotatercept for the treatment of PAH.

Though Acceleron’s management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risk and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and go beyond the control of Acceleron, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements due to various factors, risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks related to (a) Acceleron’s and Merck’s inability to complete the acquisition on the proposed terms and the proposed timeline, due to factors such as regulatory approvals, the possibility that competing offers will be made and risks associated with executing business combination transactions, such as the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully, that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that the expected benefits of the acquisition will not be realized, (b) future opportunities and plans for the combined company, including uncertainty of the expected financial performance and results of the combined company following completion of the proposed acquisition, disruption from the proposed acquisition making it more difficult to conduct business as usual or to maintain relationships with customers, employees, manufacturers, suppliers or patient groups, and the possibility that, if the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the proposed acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, that the market price of Merck’s shares could decline, (c) the ability to grow sales and revenues from existing products and to develop, commercialize or market new products, (d) competition, (e) the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including future clinical data and analysis, regulatory obligations and oversight by regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including decisions of such authorities regarding whether and when to approve any drug, device or biological application that may be filed for any product candidates as well as decisions regarding labelling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of any product candidates, (f) the absence of a guarantee that any product candidates, if approved, will be commercially successful, (g) the future approval and commercial success of therapeutic alternatives, (h) Acceleron’s intellectual property and any related pending or future litigation and the ultimate outcome of such litigation, (i) trends in exchange rates and prevailing interest rates, (j) volatile economic and market conditions, (k) preclinical testing of Acceleron’s compounds and data from clinical trials, including the risk that they may not be predictive of the results or success of other clinical trials, (l) regulatory approval of Acceleron’s compounds, and the risk that approval in one indication or country may not be predictive of approval in another indication or country, (m) the development of Acceleron’s compounds, and the risk that it may take longer and/or cost more than planned or accelerate faster than currently expected, (n) Acceleron’s or its collaboration partner, Bristol Myers Squibb’s (“BMS”), inability to successfully complete the clinical development of Acceleron’s compounds, or that Acceleron or BMS may be delayed in initiating, enrolling or completing any clinical trials, and that Acceleron’s compounds may not receive regulatory approval or become commercially successful products and (o) the impact that COVID-19 will have on Acceleron and its respective customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and the financial condition of any one of them, as well as on Acceleron’s employees and on the global economy as a whole. Any material effect of COVID-19 on any of the foregoing could also adversely impact Acceleron. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise of which Acceleron is not currently aware and may exacerbate other previously identified risks. While the list of factors presented here is representative, no list should be considered a statement of all potential risks, uncertainties or assumptions that could have a material adverse effect on the companies’ consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The foregoing factors should be read in conjunction with the risks and uncertainties identified under the heading “Risk Factors” included in Acceleron’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other filings that Acceleron has made and may make with the SEC in the future. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management's current views, plans, estimates, assumptions, and projections with respect to future events, and Acceleron does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

</section>Under the terms and conditions of this agreement, Sunovion grants Otsuka rights to jointly develop and commercialize the four compounds worldwide. The Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Group (Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, Sunovion, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd.) and Otsuka will pursue joint development of these compounds. With regard to commercialization, the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Group will record sales in the following each country and region: the United States, Canada, Japan and Asia (China, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia) and, the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Group and Otsuka plan to co-promote the four compounds jointly in principle. In addition, Otsuka will record sales in 41 other countries and regions including countries in Europe. (The parties will discuss other regions in the future.)

Sunovion and Otsuka will share expenses and profits involved in clinical studies, applications for approval, and commercialization in each of these countries and regions under the agreement. Additional indications for ulotaront and indications for SEP-378614 and SEP-380135 will be determined after future consultations between the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Group and Otsuka.

Upon the completion of this agreement, Otsuka will pay Sunovion a lump-sum upfront payment of USD 270 million (approximately JPY 30 billion). In the future, Otsuka will make development milestone payments for the four compounds of USD 620 million (approximately JPY 69 billion), and potentially more depending on the number of additional indications obtained for them. Potentially, sales milestone payments will also be made by Otsuka.

""We are pleased to have signed this agreement with Otsuka, which has wide global reach and significant neuropsychiatry expertise. We will work together to more rapidly and reliably develop and commercialize valuable pharmaceuticals for more patients around the world with the expectation that these new medications will grow,"" said Hiroshi Nomura, president and CEO of Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma. ""Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma aims to achieve sustained growth through global collaboration in anticipation of the loss of the atypical antipsychotic agent Latuda<sup>®</sup>'s exclusivity in the United States and other future changes in the business environment. This collaboration is a major step forward in this initiative.""

""Otsuka has been committed to providing new antipsychotics that contribute to patients worldwide in the field of neuropsychiatry by leveraging internal capabilities and external collaborations, starting with the launch of antipsychotics in the United States in 2002,"" said Makoto Inoue, president and representative director of Otsuka. ""We are advancing in new areas such as the development of drugs to treat agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type and the deployment of the world's first digital medicine. Through this agreement, we are confident the companies will be able to deliver even more value to patients through the experience and networks that we have cultivated over many years worldwide.""

Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma plans to post the lump-sum upfront payment as revenue in its consolidated financial results for the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 and has already factored it into the financial forecast for this fiscal year.

About ulotaront (SEP-363856)
<p class=""1"">Ulotaront (SEP-363856) is a trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) agonist with serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist activity, jointly developed by Sunovion and PsychoGenics Inc, which is a small-molecule oral agent that does not bind to dopamine D<sub>2</sub> or serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors. Sunovion discovered ulotaront in collaboration with PsychoGenics using its in vivo phenotypic SmartCube<sup>®</sup> platform and associated artificial intelligence algorithms. Phase 2 study results supported efficacy in treating both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia while demonstrating a side effect profile with notable similarities to placebo in extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, lipid and glucose derangements, and prolactin elevation. The full results of the study were published in the<b> </b><i>New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)</i> in April 2020.
The agent is undergoing Phase 3 studies for schizophrenia in the United States and global clinical Phase 2/3 studies in Japan and China, with other indications under consideration. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for ulotaront for the treatment of schizophrenia in May 2019.</p>
<p class=""1"">About SEP-4199</p>
<p class=""1"">SEP-4199 is a small-molecule oral agent with a non-racemic ratio of amisulpride enantiomers developed by Sunovion. Sunovion discovered that the pharmacology of amisulpride is enantiomer-specific, and increasing the ratio of R-amisulpride to S-amisulpride increases the potency for serotonin 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors relative to dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors. SEP-4199 was designed with an 85:15 ratio of R-amisulpride to S-amisulpride to increase levels of serotonin 5-HT<sub>7</sub> activity intended to enhance antidepressant efficacy and produce reduced levels of D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy appropriate for the treatment of bipolar depression.
In September 2021, Sunovion initiated a global clinical Phase 3 study, which is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dosed study for the treatment of bipolar I depression in the U.S. Japan will join this global clinical Phase 3 study.</p>
<p class=""1"">About SEP-378614</p>
<p class=""1"">SEP-378614, jointly discovered by Sunovion and PsychoGenics, is a small-molecule oral agent that acts on the central nervous system. Sunovion discovered SEP-378614 in collaboration with PsychoGenics using its in vivo phenotypic SmartCube<sup>®</sup> platform and associated artificial intelligence algorithms. Pre-clinical study results suggest that it may have rapid onset and long-lasting antidepressant-like activity and enhance neuroplasticity.
The agent is undergoing Phase 1 studies in the U.S.</p>
<p class=""1"">About SEP-380135</p>
<p class=""1"">SEP-380135, jointly developed by Sunovion and PsychoGenics, is a small-molecule oral agent that acts on the central nervous system. Sunovion discovered SEP-380135 in collaboration with PsychoGenics using its in vivo phenotypic SmartCube<sup>®</sup> platform and associated artificial intelligence algorithms. Pre-clinical study results suggest its efficacy against a number of behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia, including agitation/aggression, psychomotor hyperactivity, depression, and deficits in social interaction.
The agent is undergoing Phase 1 studies in the U.S.</p>

Novartis today announced positive Phase IIb data showing remibrutinib (LOU064), a potentially best-in-class oral BTK inhibitor, demonstrated rapid and effective disease control in patients with inadequately controlled chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The data were presented as a late-breaking abstract at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 30th Anniversary Congress.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT03926611) evaluated the efficacy and safety of remibrutinib over 12 weeks in patients inadequately controlled with antihistamines. Patients (n=311) were randomized to placebo or different doses of remibrutinib, taken orally. The primary endpoint was achieved with remibrutinib showing a statistically significant dose-response compared to placebo with respect to change from baseline in UAS7 score at Week 4¹.

All remibrutinib doses provided significant improvements with respect to change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 4 and at Week 12 (p&lt;0.0001 for all doses vs placebo) and demonstrated a rapid improvement as of Week 1. Compared with placebo, more patients receiving any remibrutinib dose achieved a complete control with absence of hives and itch (UAS7=0) or well-controlled disease (UAS7=6) until Week 12 (end of treatment). Remibrutinib showed a favorable safety profile and good tolerability across the entire dose range tested, with no dose-dependent pattern.

“Up to one percent of the world’s population is affected by CSU² and we are proud of our contribution to advancing treatment. Despite these advances, there continues to be a need for new CSU therapies and we are committed to challenge the boundaries of innovation,” said Angelika Jahreis, M.D., Ph.D., Novartis Global Head Development Unit Immunology, Hepatology &amp; Dermatology. “The fast-onset of control achieved with this novel oral agent in patients with previously inadequately-controlled CSU is compelling, and we are excited to rapidly develop remibrutinib.”

CSU is a distressing and unpredictable disease, characterized by the occurrence of itchy wheals (hives), angioedema, or both for 6 weeks or more without specific external stimuli³´4 and can have a major negative impact on patients’ quality of life². It most commonly persists for 1-5 years, but in some cases even longer. Despite existing treatments, the disease remains inadequately controlled in a large portion of patients5.

Remibrutinib is a highly selective, potent oral BTK inhibitor discovered within Novartis6´7 and being developed in a number of clinical and early settings. With an unmet need for new CSU therapies, highlighting the importance of targeting new modes of action, BTK inhibition may be an attractive therapeutic option for CSU, due to its pivotal role in FceR1-mediated (high affinity receptor of IgE) signalling of mast cells and basophils and their relevance to CSU pathogenesis.

<strong>About the study</strong>
NCT03926611 is a Phase IIb, dose-finding, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of remibrutinib over 12 weeks of treatment in patients with at least moderately active CSU, inadequately controlled by second generation H1-antihistamines. Eligible patients had CSU for =6 months and a weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) =16 at randomization. The primary aim was to establish a dose-response relationship for remibrutinib with respect to change from baseline (CFB) in UAS7 at Week 4. Secondary endpoints included CFB in UAS7 over time; UAS7=0 (complete absence of hives and itch) over time, UAS7=6 (well-controlled disease response) over time and recording of adverse events (AEs) to assess safety¹.

<strong>Novartis in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)</strong>
Novartis is curious about the science beneath the skin and dedicated to reimagining the care of patients with diseases that can severely limit quality of life such as CSU, psoriasis, acne, and atopic dermatitis. Novartis is committed to developing medicines that will advance the treatment of CSU, so patients are able to live their lives without the distressing and unpredictable symptoms of this debilitating disease. These include ligelizumab (QGE031) a next generation high-affinity monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibody and remibrutinib (LOU064) a potentially best-in-class oral BTK inhibitor. It is intended that these investigational therapies will complement Xolair, our existing approved add-on therapy for CSU.

In the US, Novartis and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. Outside the US, Novartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Dermavant Sciences, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics in immuno-dermatology, today announced final results from the Phase 3 PSOARING 3 long-term extension study of its investigational product tapinarof, a 1% once daily, non-steroidal topical cream for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. The study results demonstrated that tapinarof cream was well tolerated long term, with a safety profile consistent with the pivotal studies and previously reported interim analysis of data from PSOARING 3. In addition, in the study tapinarof demonstrated a high rate of complete disease clearance, a median remittive effect off-therapy for approximately four months for patients entering with a PGA score of 0, durability of response for up to 52 weeks, and consistent efficacy regardless of intermittent treatment based on PGA response during the study. The data were presented during a Late-Breaking Session at the 30th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Virtual Congress.

“For the millions of people living with plaque psoriasis, the chronic nature of the condition has both physical and emotional impacts, leaving many looking for additional treatment options,” said Bruce Strober, MD, PhD, Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Yale University School of Medicine, and lead investigator for the PSOARING 3 study. “These consistent PSOARING 3 safety and efficacy results suggest that, subject to FDA approval, tapinarof could be an important new topical treatment option for this debilitating condition.”

Eligible patients completing PSOARING 1 or 2, which were 12-week pivotal studies of tapinarof in adults with plaque psoriasis, could enroll in PSOARING 3, which comprised an additional 40 weeks of open-label treatment followed by a 4-week follow-up. Subjects who received tapinarof treatment during PSOARING 1 or 2 and completed PSOARING 3 received treatment for up to 52 weeks. PSOARING 3, which enrolled 763 patients, was designed to assess the safety and real-world use of tapinarof, and included prespecified analyses of duration of remittive effect off-therapy (defined as off-therapy maintenance of a PGA score of 0 or 1) and durability of response on-therapy. Outcomes were based on Physician Global Assessment (PGA) scores. Results from a planned interim analysis of data from PSOARING 3 were previously <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermavant.com%2Fpositive-data-from-psoaring-3-support-long-term-use-of-tapinarof-cream-in-adults-with-plaque-psoriasis-with-durable-on-therapy-and-remittive-off-therapy-benefits%2F&amp;esheet=52500727&amp;newsitemid=20210930005071&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=1&amp;md5=4d1451efc6d9eb58cab53fd7fc8a4817"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">announced</a> in February 2021.

<b>Efficacy Data</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>58.2% (302/519) of patients who entered the PSOARING 3 study with a PGA score =2 achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1, demonstrating tapinarof's continued improvement in efficacy beyond the 12-week pivotal studies.</li>
 	<li>40.9% (312/763) of all patients achieved complete disease clearance (PGA score of 0).</li>
 	<li>Remittive effect, which was defined as off-therapy maintenance of a PGA score of 0 or 1, was observed in the study:
<ul class=""bwlistcircle"">
 	<li>Median duration of remittive effect off-therapy was 115 days (approximately 4 months) for patients entering the study with a PGA score of 0 (n=79).</li>
 	<li>Among patients entering the study with or achieving a PGA score of 0 (n=312), the mean duration of remittive effect off-therapy was 130 days.</li>
 	<li>Durability of response, which was defined as no tachyphylaxis over time, was demonstrated for up to 52 weeks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
“With a high rate of complete disease clearance, a 4-month median remittive effect for patients entering with a PGA score of 0, and durable response with long-term use demonstrated in the PSOARING 3 study, the data for tapinarof continues to impress me over time,” said Linda Stein Gold, MD, Director of Dermatology Clinical Research at Henry Ford Health System, and PSOARING 3 study investigator. “As a clinician, I am excited about these final results from PSOARING 3 and the potential for tapinarof to be a new therapy for patients suffering from plaque psoriasis.”

<b>Safety Data</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were consistent with those from the interim analysis of data from PSOARING 3 and from the PSOARING 1 and 2 trials, with no new safety signals observed with long-term use.</li>
 	<li>TEAEs were mostly mild to moderate, at application sites, and associated with a low discontinuation rate (5.4%).</li>
 	<li>Incidence and severity of folliculitis and contact dermatitis remained stable with long-term use and were associated with low discontinuation rates (1.2% and 1.4%, respectively).</li>
</ul>
Results from the interim analysis of PSOARING 3, along with results from the previously reported Phase 3 PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 trials, served as the basis for the New Drug Application that Dermavant submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2021. The FDA accepted the application and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date in Q2 2022.

“We are excited to offer a more detailed picture at EADV of the long-term efficacy and safety profile of tapinarof in PSOARING 3,” said Philip M. Brown, MD, J.D., Chief Medical Officer of Dermavant. “We look forward to engaging with the FDA on our NDA in due course, as we work to bring tapinarof to plaque psoriasis patients as expeditiously as possible.”

<b>About Dermavant’s Phase 3 Program for Tapinarof in Psoriasis</b>

Dermavant’s pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for tapinarof in adult plaque psoriasis consists of PSOARING 1 (NCT03956355) and PSOARING 2 (NCT03983980), as well as PSOARING 3 (NCT04053387), a long-term extension study.

PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2, which collectively enrolled 1,025 patients, were two identically designed, multi-center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, parallel group studies conducted in North America that evaluated the safety and efficacy of tapinarof cream, 1% dosed once daily (QD) for 12 weeks versus vehicle QD in adult patients aged 18-75 years diagnosed with plaque psoriasis. The primary endpoint of both studies was the proportion of patients who achieved a PGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with a minimum 2-grade improvement from baseline at Week 12.

PSOARING 3 was a long-term, open-label, extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tapinarof cream, 1% for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. Patients in the study had previously completed treatment with tapinarof or vehicle in either the PSOARING 1 or PSOARING 2 Phase 3 pivotal efficacy and safety studies. PSOARING 3 consisted of up to 40 weeks of tapinarof cream, 1%, and a 4-week safety follow-up period. As such, patients who received drug during PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 and completed PSOARING 3 received treatment with tapinarof cream for up to 52 weeks. Greater than 90% of eligible patients who completed PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 enrolled in PSOARING 3. Dermavant released interim analysis results from PSOARING 3 in February 2021 and the study completed on April 5, 2021.

<b>About Psoriasis</b>

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by red patches and plaques with silvery scales on the skin. Psoriasis affects approximately 8 million people in the United States and 125 million worldwide.

Psoriasis can begin at any age, but typically has two peaks of onset, the first at age 20 to 30 years and the second at age 50 to 60 years. People with psoriasis are at an increased risk of developing other chronic and serious health conditions. Comorbidities include psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and depression. Psoriasis has a significant impact on quality of life and on psychological health.

<p align=""justify"">Positive results from a Phase 2a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of amlitelimab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting key immune system regulator OX40-Ligand, were presented as a late-breaker today at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology (EADV) 2021 Virtual Congress. In the study, amlitelimab showed significant improvements in signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with a well-tolerated safety profile in adults whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical medications are not a recommended treatment approach.</p>
<em>""</em><em>While</em> <em>new </em><em>option</em><em>s </em><em>are </em><em>increasingly </em><em>available for</em><em> the treatment of</em> <em>a</em><em>topic </em><em>d</em><em>ermatitis</em><em>, </em><em>individual patients have </em><em>different </em><em>respon</em><em>s</em><em>es</em><em> to therapies</em><em> and therefore require different solutions</em><em>,"" </em>said Professor Stephan Weidinger, M.D., Ph.D., Vice Director, Professor, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein<em>. “</em><em>In the </em><em>Phase 2a </em><em>study</em><em> presented at EADV</em><em>,</em> <em>amlitelimab</em> <em>was shown to </em><em>meaningfully improve the signs and symptoms of</em><em> atopic dermatitis </em><em>patients</em><em> with moderate to severe disease</em><em> with a</em><em>n</em> <em>unremarkable safety profile</em><em>.</em><em> These early results are exciting</em><em>,</em><em> and we look forw</em><em>ard </em><em>to </em><em>seeking</em> <em>confirmatory data in future </em><em>amlitelimab</em><em> clinical trials.</em><em>”</em>
<p align=""justify"">In this Phase 2a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, participants were randomized to either intravenous amlitelimab-low dose (LD) (n=29), intravenous amlitelimab-high dose (HD) (n=30) or placebo (n=29) and were treated every four weeks over a 12-week period. Eligible patients included adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is inadequately controlled with topical therapies such as corticosteroids, or where such therapies were not advisable.</p>
Co-primary endpoints included percent change in EASI from baseline, and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), at week 16.

At week 16, the data demonstrated that when dosed every four weeks:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Patients treated with amlitelimab-LD showed 80% improvement in average EASI from baseline, and patients treated with amlitelimab-HD showed 70% improvement in average EASI from baseline, compared to 49% for the placebo group (p=0.009 and p=0.072, respectively). The difference between amlitelimab-LD and placebo was nominally statistically significant.</li>
 	<li>The onset of response versus placebo was seen as early as Week 2 for both amlitelimab groups. No meaningful difference in responses was seen for the amlitelimab-LD and amlitelimab-HD groups.</li>
 	<li>The overall rate of TEAEs was 35% for amlitelimab-LD, 17% for amlitelimab-HD and 31% for placebo. One serious adverse event was reported in the amlitelimab-LD group (infected atheroma) deemed related by the investigator at week 16; the event was resolved, and the patient was able to complete the study. No hypersensitivity reactions were reported.</li>
</ul>
Also, at 16 weeks, key secondary endpoint data included:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>44% of patients treated with amlitelimab-LD and 37% of patients treated with amlitelimab-HD achieved a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) on the validated Investigator's Global Assessment (vIGA) scale compared with 8% with placebo (p&lt;0.001 both LD and HD). The vIGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) that measures the overall severity of skin lesions.</li>
 	<li>59% of amlitelimab-LD and 52% of amlitelimab-HD patients achieved 75% or greater skin improvement (EASI-75) compared to 25% with placebo.</li>
 	<li>33% of amlitelimab-LD and 30% of amlitelimab-HD patients achieved 90% or greater skin improvement (EASI-790 compared to 13% with placebo.</li>
 	<li>A 60% improvement in the amlitelimab-LD group and a 59% improvement in the amlitelimab-HD group compared with 37% improvement in the placebo group in mean percent change from baseline in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), a combined measure of area and severity of atopic dermatitis on the skin as well as patient-reported symptoms of itch and sleeplessness, (p=0.011 and p=0.016, respectively).</li>
 	<li>At Week 36, 68% of patients who achieved a vIGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 maintained their response — 24 weeks after their last dose.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify""><em>“The </em><em>amlitelimab</em><em> data </em><em>presented </em><em>at EADV </em><em>support </em><em>our belief that OX40</em><em>-</em><em>L</em><em>igand</em><em> has the potential to provid</em><em>e a </em><em>n</em><em>ovel</em><em> approach to treating a range of immune-mediated diseases,"" </em>said Naimish Patel, M.D. Head of Global Development in Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi.<em> ""</em><em>This Phase 2a trial is the foundation of our clinical trial program with </em><em>amlitelimab</em><em> in atopic dermatitis. </em><em>T</em><em>he</em><em> forthcoming global</em><em> Phase 2</em><em>b</em><em> trial </em><em>will further</em><em> evaluate the impact of </em><em>amlitelimab</em> <em>when given subcutaneously </em><em>in </em><em>patients </em><em>with moderate</em><em>-</em><em>to</em><em>-</em><em>severe</em><em> atopic dermatitis.</em><em> The results from these two trials will</em> <em>help</em><em> form the basis for designing a phase 3 clinical trial program to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of </em><em>amlitelimab</em><em>.</em><em>""</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">Amlitelimab is a fully human non-depleting monoclonal antibody that binds to OX40-Ligand, a key immune regulator, and has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for a range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders, including moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. By targeting OX40-Ligand, amlitelimab aims to restore immune homeostasis between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory T cells.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Amlitelimab is being studied in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with suboptimal response to topical therapies. The potential for long-lasting treatment responses in atopic dermatitis patients may help reduce the burden of frequent dosing, and further investigation will be conducted in a future Phase 2b study. Amlitelimab is currently under clinical investigation, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In April 2021, Sanofi finalized the acquisition of Kymab, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing fully human monoclonal antibodies with a focus on immune-mediated diseases and immuno-oncology therapeutics, adding amlitelimab to the company’s dynamic pipeline.</p>

 Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics today announced that molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801), an investigational oral antiviral medicine, significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization or death at a planned interim analysis of the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial in at risk, non-hospitalized adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. At the interim analysis, molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50%; 7.3% of patients who received molnupiravir were either hospitalized or died through Day 29 following randomization (28/385), compared with 14.1% of placebo-treated patients (53/377); p=0.0012. Through Day 29, no deaths were reported in patients who received molnupiravir, as compared to 8 deaths in patients who received placebo. At the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee and in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recruitment into the study is being stopped early due to these positive results. Merck plans to submit an application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the U.S. FDA as soon as possible based on these findings and plans to submit marketing applications to other regulatory bodies worldwide.

“More tools and treatments are urgently needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, which has become a leading cause of death and continues to profoundly affect patients, families, and societies and strain health care systems all around the world. With these compelling results, we are optimistic that molnupiravir can become an important medicine as part of the global effort to fight the pandemic and will add to Merck’s unique legacy of bringing forward breakthroughs in infectious diseases when they are needed most. Consistent with Merck’s unwavering commitment to save and improve lives, we will continue to work with regulatory agencies on our applications and do everything we can to bring molnupiravir to patients as quickly as possible,” said Robert M. Davis, chief executive officer and president, Merck. “On behalf of all of us at Merck, I thank our network of clinical investigators and patients for their essential contributions to the development of molnupiravir.”

“With the virus continuing to circulate widely, and because therapeutic options currently available are infused and/or require access to a healthcare facility, antiviral treatments that can be taken at home to keep people with COVID-19 out of the hospital are critically needed,” said Wendy Holman, chief executive officer of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. “We are very encouraged by the results from the interim analysis and hope molnupiravir, if authorized for use, can make a profound impact in controlling the pandemic. Our partnership with Merck is critical to ensuring rapid global access if this medicine is approved, and we appreciate the collaborative effort to reach this important stage of development.”

<b>About the Results of the Planned Interim Analysis</b>

The planned interim analysis evaluated data from 775 patients who were initially enrolled in the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial on or prior to Aug. 5, 2021. At the time of the decision to stop recruitment based on the compelling interim efficacy results, the trial was approaching full recruitment of the Phase 3 sample size of 1,550 patients, with more than 90% of the intended sample size already enrolled.

Eligibility criteria required that all patients had laboratory-confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19, with symptom onset within 5 days of study randomization. All patients were required to have at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcome at study entry. Molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization and/or death across all key subgroups; efficacy was not affected by timing of symptom onset or underlying risk factor. Additionally, based on the participants with available viral sequencing data (approximately 40% of participants), molnupiravir demonstrated consistent efficacy across viral variants Gamma, Delta, and Mu.

The incidence of any adverse event was comparable in the molnupiravir and placebo groups (35% and 40%, respectively). Similarly, the incidence of drug-related adverse events was also comparable (12% and 11%, respectively). Fewer subjects discontinued study therapy due to an adverse event in the molnupiravir group (1.3%) compared to the placebo group (3.4%).

<b>About Merck’s Efforts to Enable Access to Molnupiravir, if it is Granted EUA or Approval</b>

In anticipation of the results from MOVe-OUT, Merck has been producing molnupiravir at risk. Merck expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by the end of 2021, with more doses expected to be produced in 2022.

Earlier this year, Merck <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-announces-supply-agreement-with-u-s-government-for-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-candidate-for-treatment-of-mild-to-moderate-covid-19%2F&amp;esheet=52502008&amp;newsitemid=20211001005189&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=entered&amp;index=1&amp;md5=f1eb49a20aceb153a2c5e31cfdfa3f71"" rel=""nofollow"">entered</a> into a procurement agreement with the U.S. Government under which Merck will supply approximately 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir to the U.S. government, upon EUA or approval from the U.S. FDA. Additionally, Merck has entered into supply and purchase agreements for molnupiravir with other governments worldwide, pending regulatory authorization, and is currently in discussions with other governments.

Merck is committed to providing timely access to molnupiravir globally, if it is authorized or approved, and plans to implement a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria to reflect countries’ relative ability to finance their health response to the pandemic.

As part of its commitment to widespread global access, Merck previously <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Famid-humanitarian-crisis-in-india-merck-announces-voluntary-licensing-agreements-with-five-indian-generics-manufacturers-to-accelerate-and-expand-global-access-to-molnupiravir-an-investigational-ora%2F&amp;esheet=52502008&amp;newsitemid=20211001005189&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=2&amp;md5=476c728fc6d313363edc61c16bd477b3"" rel=""nofollow"">announced</a> that the company has entered into non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for molnupiravir with established generic manufacturers to accelerate availability of molnupiravir in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies.

<b>More About the MOVe-OUT Study</b>

The MOVe-OUT trial (MK-4482-002) (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04575597%3Fterm%3Dmolnupiravir%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&amp;esheet=52502008&amp;newsitemid=20211001005189&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT04575597&amp;index=3&amp;md5=d00529fc8647b82c99f3f53d57191335"" rel=""nofollow"">NCT04575597</a>) was a global Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study of non-hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19, at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes, and symptom onset within five days prior to randomization. The primary efficacy objective of MOVe-OUT is to evaluate the efficacy of molnupiravir compared to placebo as assessed by the percentage of participants who are hospitalized and/or die from the time of randomization through Day 29.

The Phase 3 portion of the MOVe-OUT trial was conducted globally, including in more than 170 planned sites in countries including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The most common risk factors for poor disease outcome included obesity, older age (<span class=""bwuline"">&gt;</span>60 years), diabetes mellitus, and heart disease. To date, the Delta, Gamma, and Mu variants have accounted for nearly 80% of the evaluable cases in the trial. Recruitment in Latin America, Europe, and Africa accounted for 55%, 23% and 15% of the study population, respectively.

<b>About Molnupiravir</b>

Molnupiravir (MK-4482/EIDD-2801) is an investigational, orally administered form of a potent ribonucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Molnupiravir has been shown to be active in several preclinical models of SARS-CoV-2, including for prophylaxis, treatment, and prevention of transmission. Additionally, pre-clinical and clinical data have shown molnupiravir to be active against the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants. Molnupiravir was invented at Drug Innovations at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, a not-for-profit biotechnology company wholly owned by Emory University, and is being developed by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of molnupiravir have been provided by Merck and by Wayne and Wendy Holman of Ridgeback.

Molnupiravir is also being evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis in MOVe-AHEAD, a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households.

“Melanoma can be a devastating disease and cases have been on the rise for years. The results from the RELATIVITY-047 trial demonstrate the potential that the relatlimab and nivolumab fixed-dose combination holds for people with advanced forms of this cancer,” said Jonathan Cheng, senior vice president and head of oncology development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “If approved, this treatment would become the first of its kind available to patients in the European Union. We look forward to working with the EMA as they evaluate this combination – which includes our third distinct checkpoint inhibitor – and are proud of this first step toward making it available for patients with advanced melanoma.”

The filing was based on the efficacy and safety results from the Phase 2/3 RELATIVITY-047 trial, which is the first trial to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful progression-free survival benefit of a combination therapy over standard of care anti-PD-1 monotherapy in metastatic melanoma.

Primary results from the RELATIVITY-047 trial were presented in an oral abstract session and selected for the official press program for the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2021. Data were also presented in an oral presentation during the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Annual Meeting in September 2021.

The U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA) has also accepted for priority review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the relatlimab and nivolumab fixed-dose combination.

The fixed-dose combination of relatlimab and nivolumab is an investigational therapy and is not approved for use in any country.

Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the RELATIVITY-047 clinical trial.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About RELATIVITY-047 (CA224-047)</span></b>

RELATIVITY-047 (CA224-047) is a global, randomized, double-blind Phase 2/3 study evaluating the fixed-dose combination of relatlimab and nivolumab in patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma versus <i>Opdivo </i>alone. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival (PFS) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and the secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). A total of 714 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a fixed-dose combination of relatlimab 160 mg and nivolumab 480 mg or <i>Opdivo</i> 480 mg by intravenous infusion every four weeks until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Follow-up for the secondary endpoints of OS and ORR is ongoing.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About LAG-3</span></b>

Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) is a cell-surface molecule expressed on effector T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and functions to control T-cell response, activation and growth. Preclinical studies indicate that inhibition of LAG-3 may restore effector function of exhausted T cells and potentially promote an anti-tumor response. Early research demonstrates that targeting LAG-3 in combination with other potentially complementary immune checkpoints may be a key strategy to more effectively potentiate anti-tumor immune activity.

Bristol Myers Squibb is evaluating relatlimab, its LAG-3-blocking antibody, in clinical trials in combination with other agents in a variety of tumor types.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Melanoma</span></b>

Melanoma is a form of skin cancer characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) located in the skin. Metastatic melanoma is the deadliest form of the disease and occurs when cancer spreads beyond the surface of the skin to other organs. The incidence of melanoma has been increasing steadily for the last 30 years. In the United States, 106,110 new diagnoses of melanoma and about 7,180 related deaths are estimated for 2021. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that by 2035, melanoma incidence will reach 424,102, with 94,308 related deaths. Melanoma is mostly curable when treated in its very early stages; however, survival rates decrease if regional lymph nodes are involved.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

Some ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada–like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients. In MPM patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO or YERVOY. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.

Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone</b>

In randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.

<b>Lactation</b>

There are no data on the presence of OPDIVO or YERVOY in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose.

<b>Serious Adverse Reactions</b>

In Checkmate 037, serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=268). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse drug reactions reported in 2% to &lt;5% of patients receiving OPDIVO were abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased lipase. In Checkmate 066, serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=206). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in =2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were gamma-glutamyltransferase increase (3.9%) and diarrhea (3.4%). In Checkmate 067, serious adverse reactions (74% and 44%), adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation (47% and 18%) or to dosing delays (58% and 36%), and Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (72% and 51%) a",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bristol-Myers-Squibb-1.jpg,Regulatory,BMS,Relatlimab|Nivolumab,Metastatic Melanoma|Regulatory|MAA|1L Treatment ,publish,01-10-2021,2

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Kite, a Gilead Company (Nasdaq: GILD), today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval for Tecartus® (brexucabtagene autoleucel) for the treatment of adult patients (18 years and older) with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Following FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation and a priority review, Tecartus is the first and only chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy approved for adults (18 years and older) with ALL. There is a high unmet need, as half of this patient population will relapse, and median overall survival (OS) is only approximately eight months with current standard-of-care treatments. Patients can access Tecartus through 109 authorized treatment centers across the U.S.

“Adults with ALL face a significantly poorer prognosis compared to children, and roughly half of all adults with B-ALL will relapse on currently available therapies,” said Bijal Shah, MD, ZUMA-3 investigator and medical oncologist, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida. “We now have a new meaningful advancement in treatment for these patients. A single infusion of Tecartus has demonstrated durable responses, suggesting the potential for long-term remission and a new approach to care.”

The approval is based on results from ZUMA-3, a global, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study in which 65% of the evaluable patients (n=54) achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematological recovery (CRi) at a median actual follow-up of 12.3 months. The duration of CR was estimated to exceed 12 months for more than half the patients. Among efficacy-evaluable patients, median duration of remission (DOR) was 13.6 months. Among the patients treated with Tecartus at the target dose (n=78), Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events occurred in 26% and 35% of patients, respectively, and were generally well-managed.

“Today marks Kite’s fourth FDA approved indication in cell therapy in under four years, demonstrating our commitment to advancing CAR T for patients across many different hematologic malignancies,” said Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite. “Tecartus has already transformed outcomes for adults living with mantle cell lymphoma, and we look forward to offering the hope for a cure to patients with ALL.”

Adults with relapsed or refractory ALL often undergo multiple treatments including chemotherapy, targeted therapy and stem cell transplant. CAR T-cell therapy works differently, by harnessing a patient’s own immune system to fight cancer. With CAR T, the patient’s blood is drawn and the T cells are separated. Then the T cells are genetically engineered with a specific receptor that enables them to identify and attack cancer cells, and put back into the patient’s body.

“Roughly half of all ALL cases actually occur in adults, and unlike pediatric ALL, adult ALL has historically had a poor prognosis,” said Lee Greenberger, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS). “Developing new therapies that would be life-changing for people with cancer has been a dream of LLS. We are proud to see the potential of CAR T realized for even more people with this approval for brexucabtagene autoleucel.”

Tecartus is also currently under review in the European Union and United Kingdom for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL.

The Tecartus U.S. Prescribing Information has a BOXED WARNING for the risks of CRS and neurologic toxicities, and Tecartus is approved with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) due to these risks; see below for Important Safety Information.

Additional Information About ZUMA-3 Trial

Further efficacy results from the ZUMA-3 trial have been published and presented in scientific forums. Published Phase 1 data showed 32% of responders (n=22) were still in remission at the median follow-up of 22.1 months. In Phase 2 data presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, investigators reported that among treated patients (n=54), 31% of these patients were in ongoing response at a median follow-up of 16.4 months. 97% of responders had deep molecular remission, with undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD), and median OS among all responders has not yet been reached. A safety analysis, reported in the Lancet, showed among all patients who experienced a neurologic event, 94% of CRS events and 88% of neurologic events were resolved.

ZUMA-3 is an international multicenter, registrational Phase 1/2 study in adult patients (=18 years old) with ALL whose disease is refractory to or has relapsed following first standard systemic therapy with remission of 12 months or less, after two or more lines of systemic therapy or at least 100 days after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Seventy-one patients were enrolled (and leukapheresed) in the study, and the primary endpoint was overall complete remission rate (OCR, equaling complete remission plus complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) as determined by an independent review.

About ALL

ALL is an aggressive type of blood cancer that can also involve the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, central nervous system and other organs. Approximately 1,000 adults are treated annually for relapsed or refractory ALL. B-cell precursor ALL is the most common form, accounting for approximately 75% of cases, and treatment is typically associated with inferior outcomes compared with other types of ALL. Survival rates remain very poor in adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, with median OS at less than eight months.

About Tecartus

Tecartus is an autologous, anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Tecartus uses the XLP™ manufacturing process that includes T cell enrichment, a necessary step in certain B-cell malignancies in which circulating lymphoblasts are a common feature. Tecartus is also being evaluated in pediatric ALL, where its use is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been established.

U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME and NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Tecartus. Do not administer Tecartus to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.
Neurologic toxicities, including life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Tecartus, including concurrently with CRS or after CRS resolution. Monitor for neurologic toxicities after treatment with Tecartus. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.
Tecartus is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program.
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with Tecartus. In ZUMA-2, CRS occurred in 91% (75/82) of patients receiving Tecartus, including = Grade 3 CRS in 18% of patients. Among the patients who died after receiving Tecartus, one had a fatal CRS event. The median time to onset of CRS was three days (range: 1 to 13 days) and the median duration of CRS was ten days (range: 1 to 50 days). Among patients with CRS, the key manifestations (>10%) were similar in MCL and ALL and included fever (93%), hypotension (62%), tachycardia (59%), chills (32%), hypoxia (31%), headache (21%), fatigue (20%), and nausea (13%). Serious events associated with CRS included hypotension, fever, hypoxia, tachycardia, and dyspnea.

Ensure that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available for each patient prior to infusion of Tecartus. Following infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS daily for at least seven days at the certified healthcare facility, and for four weeks thereafter. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated.

Neurologic Events, including those that were fatal or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with Tecartus. Neurologic events occurred in 81% (66/82) of patients with MCL, including = Grade 3 in 37% of patients. The median time to onset for neurologic events was six days (range: 1 to 32 days) with a median duration of 21 days (range: 2 to 454 days) in patients with MCL. Neurologic events occurred in 87% (68/78) of patients with ALL, including = Grade 3 in 35% of patients. The median time to onset for neurologic events was seven days (range: 1 to 51 days) with a median duration of 15 days (range: 1 to 397 days) in patients with ALL. For patients with MCL, 54 (66%) patients experienced CRS before the onset of neurological events. Five (6%) patients did not experience CRS with neurologic events and eight patients (10%) developed neurological events after the resolution of CRS. Neurologic events resolved for 119 out of 134 (89%) patients treated with Tecartus. Nine patients (three patients with MCL and six patients with ALL) had ongoing neurologic events at the time of death. For patients with ALL, neurologic events occurred before, during, and after CRS in 4 (5%), 57 (73%), and 8 (10%) of patients; respectively. Three patients (4%) had neurologic events without CRS. The onset of neurologic events can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS or in the absence of CRS.

The most common neurologic events (>10%) were similar in MCL and ALL and included encephalopathy (57%), headache (37%), tremor (34%), confusional state (26%), aphasia (23%), delirium (17%), dizziness (15%), anxiety (14%), and agitation (12%). Serious events including encephalopathy, aphasia, confusional state, and seizures occurred after treatment with Tecartus.

Monitor patients daily for at least seven days for patients with MCL and at least 14 days for patients with ALL at the certified healthcare facility and for four weeks following infusion for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities and treat promptly.

REMS Program: Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Tecartus is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program which requires that:

Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer Tecartus must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements. Certified healthcare facilities must have on-site, immediate access to tocilizumab, and ensure that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available for each patient for infusion within two hours after Tecartus infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS.
Certified healthcare facilities must ensure that healthcare providers who prescribe, dispense, or administer Tecartus are trained in the management of CRS and neurologic toxicities. Further information is available at www.YescartaTecartusREMS.com or 1-844-454-KITE (5483).
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or residual gentamicin in Tecartus.

Severe Infections: Severe or life-threatening infections occurred in patients after Tecartus infusion. Infections (all grades) occurred in 56% (46/82) of patients with MCL and 44% (34/78) of patients with ALL. Grade 3 or higher infections, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, occurred in 30% of patients with ALL and MCL. Tecartus should not be administered to patients with clinically significant active systemic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after Tecartus infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to local guidelines.

Febrile neutropenia was observed in 6% of patients with MCL and 35% of patients with ALL after Tecartus infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. The febrile neutropenia in 27 (35%) of patients with ALL includes events of “febrile neutropenia” (11 (14%)) plus the concurrent events of “fever” and “neutropenia” (16 (21%)). In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.

In immunosuppressed patients, life-threatening and fatal opportunistic infections have been reported. The possibility of rare infectious etiologies (e.g., fungal and viral infections such as HHV-6 and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) should be considered in patients with neurologic events and appropriate diagnostic evaluations should be performed.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. Perform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

Prolonged Cytopenias: Patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Tecartus infusion. In patients with MCL, Grade 3 or higher cytopenias not resolved by Day 30 following Tecartus infusion occurred in 55% (45/82) of patients and included thrombocytopenia (38%), neutropenia (37%), and anemia (17%). In patients with ALL who were responders to Tecartus treatment, Grade 3 or higher cytopenias not resolved by Day 30 following Tecartus infusion occurred in 20% (7/35) of the patients and included neutropenia (12%) and thrombocytopenia (12%); Grade 3 or higher cytopenias not resolved by Day 60 following Tecartus infusion occurred in 11% (4/35) of the patients and included neutropenia (9%) and thrombocytopenia (6%). Monitor blood counts after Tecartus infusion.

Hypogammaglobulinemia: B cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with Tecartus. Hypogammaglobulinemia was reported in 16% (13/82) of patients with MCL and 9% (7/78) of patients with ALL. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with Tecartus and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement.

The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following Tecartus treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least six weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Tecartus treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with Tecartus.

Secondary Malignancies may develop. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that one occurs, contact Kite at 1-844-454-KITE (5483) to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.

Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following Tecartus infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this period.

Adverse Reactions: The most common non-laboratory adverse reactions (= 20%) were fever, cytokine release syndrome, hypotension, encephalopathy, tachycardia, nausea, chills, headache, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, hypoxia, rash, edema, tremor, infection with pathogen unspecified, constipation, decreased appetite, and vomiting. The most common serious adverse reactions (= 2%) were cytokine release syndrome, febrile neutropenia, hypotension, encephalopathy, fever, infection with pathogen unspecified, hypoxia, tachycardia, bacterial infections, respiratory failure, seizure, diarrhea, dyspnea, fungal infections, viral infections, coagulopathy, delirium, fatigue, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, musculoskeletal pain, edema, and paraparesis.

Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced a mutual decision with GSK to terminate their agreement on bintrafusp alfa, effective September 30, 2021.

The decision is based on the clinical trial data generated to date, most notably the previously reported results from the INTR@PID Lung 037 study, which did not replicate the encouraging data observed in earlier studies. Based on the data generated during the agreement, no milestone payments were made by GSK and no future milestone obligations remain.

The INTR@PID clinical program sought to validate the potential of the novel mechanism of simultaneously blocking TGF-ß and PD-L1, with the ambition to improve outcomes for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. Given the extent of the clinical program, Merck will deepen its scientific leadership in the field and interrogate the data leveraging the power of advanced analytics. The important insights this program has yielded about the biology of TGF-ß will inform the collective understanding of this pathway.

Merck is a science-led organization dedicated to delivering transformative medicines with the goal of making a meaningful difference in the lives of people affected by cancer. Our oncology research efforts, comprised of 10 ongoing development programs, aim to leverage our synergistic portfolio in oncogenic pathways, immuno-oncology, and DNA Damage Response (DDR) to tackle challenging tumor types in gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and head and neck and thoracic cancers.

The founding family remains the majority owner of the publicly listed company. Merck holds the global rights to the Merck name and brand. The only exceptions are the United States and Canada, where the business sectors of Merck operate as EMD Serono in healthcare, MilliporeSigma in life science, and EMD Electronics.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Polpharma Biologics Group announces that its joint venture company with Santo Holding (Strüngmann Group), Bioeq, has received notification by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that the biologics license application (BLA) for its proposed biosimilar (formally also known as BQ201, FYB201, CHS-201) to Lucentis<sup>®</sup>, a blockbuster ophthalmological drug containing ranibizumab as active drug substance, has been accepted for review.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“This file acceptance is validation of the huge effort put in by the team at Bioeq and its partners to bring treatment choice and improved patient access to the US market.

The FDA has assigned a target action date for the application for August 2022.

The reference product is a monoclonal anti-angiogenic antibody fragment (Fab) that has been approved to treat the ""wet"" type of age-related macular degeneration, a common form of age-related vision loss. Worldwide, at least 25 to 30 million people are affected by age-related macular degeneration. The launch of a biosimilar Ranibizumab can increase market competition, reduce cost and expand patient access with proven analytical and clinical similarity to the original product.

This file acceptance represents the most recent milestone for Bioeq`s ranibizumab biosimilar program and compliments marketing authorization applications submitted to EMA in June and UK MHRA in July this year.

Subject to the FDA`s approval, BQ201 will be exclusively commercialized by Coherus BioSciences, Inc. in the United States.

<b>Dr Joerg Windisch, CEO of the Polpharma Biologics Group, commented on the achievements of the joint venture:</b>

“This file acceptance is validation of the huge effort put in by the team at Bioeq and its partners to bring treatment choice and improved patient access to the US market. It creates real promise for those who suffer from debilitating vision loss, including age-related macular degeneration.”

AstraZeneca has submitted a request to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for AZD7442, its long-acting antibody (LAAB) combination, for prophylaxis of symptomatic COVID-19.

If granted, AZD7442 would be the first LAAB to receive an EUA for COVID-19 prevention. It is the first LAAB with Phase III data demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 compared to placebo.

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, AstraZeneca, said: “Vulnerable populations such as the immunocompromised often aren’t able to mount a protective response following vaccination and continue to be at risk of developing COVID-19. With this first global regulatory filing, we are one step closer to providing an additional option to help protect against COVID-19 alongside vaccines. We look forward to sharing AZD7442 data for the treatment of COVID-19 later this year.”

In August, 2021, AstraZeneca announced high-level results from the <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd7442-prophylaxis-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html"">PROVENT</a> pre-exposure prophylaxis trial which showed AZD7442 reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 77% (95% confidence interval (CI): 46, 90), compared to placebo. Importantly, the trial population included people with co-morbidities and who may be in need of additional protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Greater than 75% of participants in PROVENT presented with co-morbidities associated with an increased risk of severe disease or a reduced immune response to vaccination. The trial accrued 25 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 at the primary analysis. AZD7442 was well-tolerated.

The EUA request filing includes safety and efficacy data from the PROVENT and <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/update-on-azd7442-storm-chaser-trial.html"">STORM CHASER</a> Phase III trials and the Phase I trial.

AZD7442 was optimised using AstraZeneca’s proprietary YTE half-life extension technology which more than triples the durability of its action compared to conventional antibodies<sup>1-4</sup>.

Preliminary ‘in vitro’ findings demonstrate that AZD7442 demonstrates broad anti-COVID activity, and in particular neutralises recent emergent SARS-CoV-2 viral variants, including the Delta and Mu variants.<sup>5,6</sup>

Discussions regarding supply agreements for AZD7442 are ongoing with the US Government as well as other governments around the world.

<b>About AZD7442
</b>AZD7442 is a combination of two LAABs - tixagevimab (AZD8895) and cilgavimab (AZD1061) - derived from B-cells donated by convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 virus. Discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/articles/2020/advancing-our-discovery-of-novel-coronavirus-neutralising-antibodies-against-covid-19.html"">licensed to AstraZeneca in June 2020</a>, the human monoclonal antibodies bind to distinct sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein<sup>7</sup> and were optimised by AstraZeneca with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor and complement C1q binding. The half-life extension more than triples the durability of its action compared to conventional antibodies and could afford up to 12 months of protection from COVID-19 following a single administration<sup>1-4</sup>; data from the Phase I trial show high neutralising antibody titres for at least nine months<sup>8</sup>. The reduced Fc receptor binding aims to minimise the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease - a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies promote, rather than inhibit, infection and/or disease.<sup>9</sup>

AZD7442 is being studied in a comprehensive clinical trial programme for both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in over 9,000 participants. In the Phase III PROVENT trial, AZD7442 reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 77%, compared to placebo. The trial included 5,197 participants in a 2:1 randomisation AZD7442 to placebo. The primary analysis was based on 5,172 participants who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. The LAAB was well tolerated and preliminary analyses show adverse events were balanced between the placebo and AZD7442 groups.

Other ongoing trials include TACKLE COVID-19,<sup>10</sup> a Phase III mild-to-moderate COVID-19 outpatient treatment trial, and collaborator treatment trials in outpatient and hospitalised settings.

AZD7442 is being developed with support from the US government, including federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in partnership with the Department of Defense; Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, under Contract No. W911QY-21-9-0001.

Data published in <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2548-6"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>Nature</i></a> in July 2020 showed that in preclinical experiments, the LAABs were able to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to host cells and protect against infection in cell and animal models of disease.<sup>11</sup>

Under the terms of the licensing agreement with Vanderbilt, AstraZeneca will pay single-digit royalties on future net sales.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (“Coherus”, Nasdaq: CHRS) today announced that positive results from the pivotal COLUMBUS-AMD clinical trial evaluating and comparing the efficacy and safety between CHS-201 and Lucentis® (ranibizumab) in the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) were presented October 1st by Dr. Peter K. Kaiser, Professor of Ophthalmology at the Cole Eye Institute of the Cleveland Clinic, at the 54th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Retina Society.  The COLUMBUS-AMD study demonstrated the similarity of CHS-201 and reference product Lucentis in terms of clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in patients with newly diagnosed subfoveal nAMD.

“Neovascular age-related macular degeneration destroys the sharp, central vision needed to see clearly and can affect daily activities like reading, driving, and watching television. It is responsible for more than 90 percent of AMD-related severe visual loss which has a significant deleterious impact on a patient’s quality of life,” said Dr. Kaiser. “These findings reinforce our confidence that CHS-201 delivers outcomes and safety profile similar to the reference product.”

“CHS-201 is another example of our commitment to bring patients and providers choice without compromise, and, if approved, will enable retinal specialists to make a proven, safe, and essential therapy accessible to more patients with retinal vascular disorders,” said Denny Lanfear, Coherus CEO.

CHS-201 (also known as FYB201) is being developed as a proposed biosimilar to the reference product, Lucentis® (ranibizumab). In 2019, Coherus BioSciences acquired the exclusive rights from Bioeq AG, a Swiss biopharmaceutical joint venture between the Strüngmann Group and the Polpharma Biologics Group, to commercialize CHS-201 in the United States. In August 2021, Bioeq submitted the CHS-201 biologics license application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA has accepted the BLA filing for review and set a target action date for August 2, 2022. If approved, Coherus expects to begin marketing CHS-201 in the United States in the second half of 2022.

About the COLUMBUS-AMD Study

A total of 477 patients with newly diagnosed subfoveal nAMD were randomized 1:1 to receive CHS-201 or reference Lucentis every four weeks for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured by Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters after 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in BCVA at 48 weeks, change from baseline in FCB retinal thickness at 48 weeks, safety and immunogenicity.

The study results demonstrated a mean BCVA improvement from baseline at eight weeks with an equal median change of 5.0 ETDRS letters for both CHS-201 and Lucentis® treatment groups. The mean change (SD) was 5.1 (7.52) ETDRS letters for CHS-201 and 5.6 (8.63) for Lucentis in the full analysis set population. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) least squares mean difference for the change from baseline in BCVA at week eight between CHS-201 and Lucentis was -0.4 ETDRS letters, with a 90 percent confidence interval of -1.6 to 0.9, well within the predefined equivalence margin of -3.5 to 3.5. Patients in both treatment groups experienced similar reductions in foveal center point (FCP) and foveal central subfield (FCS) retinal thickness, as well as total lesion area. Reduction in the proportion of patients with active CNV leakage and increase in the proportion of patients with a fluid-free macula were similar in both treatment groups. Overall, the frequency and type of ocular adverse events (AEs), including rates of intraocular inflammation, were comparable between the treatment groups. Most AEs were of mild or moderate intensity, and no clinically meaningful differences were identified. CHS-201 and Lucentis had comparable immunogenicity profiles.

Results of the study were published online in May 2021 in Ophthalmology.

<p align=""justify"">Jacqueline A. French, MD, Professor in the Department of Neurology at NYU Langone Health and Co-director of Epilepsy Clinical Trials at NYU Langone's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center; Founder/Director of the Epilepsy Study Consortium; and Chair of the XEN1101 X-TOLE Steering Committee, stated, “Many patients today are living with the debilitating impacts of focal seizures, even while taking multiple anti-seizure medications, so there is a substantial need for new, efficacious and well-tolerated therapies. The X-TOLE results generated from this large, multicenter, controlled trial are truly exciting because they demonstrate impressive efficacy of XEN1101 for adult patients with focal epilepsy, including those with seizures that are deemed difficult to treat. In addition, physicians and patients could benefit from XEN1101’s other important attributes, such as once-a-day dosing in the evening with no titration. With its unique potassium channel mechanism-of-action, the strength of these topline data suggest XEN1101 could play an important role in treating focal epilepsy.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Dr. Christopher Kenney, Xenon’s Chief Medical Officer commented, “On behalf of the entire Xenon team, I wish to extend our thanks to the patients, investigators, and site coordinators who participated in the X-TOLE study. We have generated strong evidence that supports the efficacy, safety and tolerability of XEN1101 and depicts a highly favorable product profile for XEN1101. Importantly, we saw statistically significant reductions of focal onset seizures compared to placebo across all dose groups, which suggests it is highly active in the central nervous system. With these compelling topline results, we are eager to work with the FDA to plan for an expedited development path moving forward.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, the Phase 2b X-TOLE clinical trial evaluated the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of XEN1101 administered as once-daily adjunctive treatment in adult patients with focal epilepsy. The study included a total of 325 randomized and treated subjects in the safety population and 323 subjects in the modified intent to treat population for the efficacy analyses. Subjects had an average age of 40.8 ± 13.3 years, and 8.9%, 40.3%, or 50.8% of the subjects were on and continued taking one, two, or three stable background anti-seizure medications (ASMs) throughout the study, respectively, and failed a median of 6 previous ASMs prior to study entry. The median baseline seizure frequency across the study groups was approximately 13.5 per month. Of the 285 subjects who completed the double-blind period, 96.5% entered the open-label extension to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of XEN1101.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Summary of Results</strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><em>Key Efficacy Findings:</em></strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The primary objective of the study was to assess the dose response trend of XEN1101 in reducing monthly focal seizure frequency, based on a ranked ANCOVA model. The median percent reduction in monthly focal seizure frequency was 52.8% in the XEN1101 25 mg group, 46.4% in the XEN1101 20 mg group, and 33.2% in the XEN1101 10 mg group compared to 18.2% in the placebo group. The monotonic dose response relationship between the XEN1101 active dose groups compared to placebo was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). These data demonstrated a highly statistically significant dose-response relationship for XEN1101 in the adjunctive treatment of focal seizures in adult patients with a history of difficult-to-treat seizures.</li>
 	<li>In addition, XEN1101 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline in monthly focal seizure frequency in pairwise comparisons to placebo for all three XEN1101 doses. The median percent reduction in monthly focal seizure frequency was 52.8% in the XEN1101 25 mg group, 46.4% in the XEN1101 20 mg group, and 33.2% in the XEN1101 10 mg group compared to 18.2% in the placebo group. Statistical significance was achieved for all dose groups compared to placebo with 2-sided p-values of p&lt;0.001 for 25 mg vs. placebo, p&lt;0.001 for 20 mg vs. placebo, and p=0.035 for 10 mg vs. placebo.</li>
 	<li>A key secondary endpoint of the study was a responder analysis, which compared the proportion of study subjects treated with XEN1101 who achieved a =50% reduction in monthly focal seizures versus placebo. The percentage of subjects who achieved a <u>&gt;</u>50% reduction in monthly focal seizures was 54.5% in the XEN1101 25 mg group, 43.1% in the XEN1101 20 mg group, and 28.3% in the XEN1101 10 mg group compared to 14.9% in the placebo group. Statistical significance was achieved for all dose groups compared to placebo with 2-sided p-values of p&lt;0.001 for 25 mg vs. placebo, p&lt;0.001 for 20 mg vs. placebo, and p=0.037 for 10 mg vs placebo.</li>
 	<li>These marked reductions in seizures were associated with statistically significant improvements in overall status, as assessed by physicians using the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) and by subject self-reporting using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scales in the XEN1101 25 mg group, which are shown in the table below with 2-sided p-values:</li>

<p align=""justify""><strong><em>Key Safety and Tolerability Findings</em></strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>XEN1101 was generally well-tolerated in this study with adverse events (AEs) consistent with other ASMs. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was higher in the treatment groups as compared to the placebo group, with 62.3% of patients in the placebo group, 67.4% of patients in the XEN1101 10 mg group, 68.6% of patients in the XEN1101 20 mg group, and 85.1% of patients in the XEN1101 25 mg group experiencing at least one TEAE. The most common TEAEs across all XEN1101 dose groups (n=211) were dizziness (n=52, 24.6%), somnolence (n=33, 15.6%), fatigue (n=23, 10.9%), and headache (n=21, 10.0%). Two TEAEs of urinary retention were reported in the active treatment groups, one of which required a dose reduction, and both subjects remained on drug with no other changes or intervention. Electrocardiogram (ECG) interval changes were infrequent and evenly balanced between placebo and active treatment groups. There have been no TEAEs of pigmentary abnormalities reported during the double-blind phase of the study or in preliminary analysis during the ongoing open-label extension to date with approximately 70 subjects now treated more than 12 months.</li>
 	<li>The incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar in all four arms of the study with 2.6% of patients in the placebo group, 4.3% of patients in the XEN1101 10 mg group, 3.9% of patients in the XEN1101 20 mg group, and 2.6% of patients in the XEN1101 25 mg group experiencing at least one treatment-emergent SAE.</li>
 	<li>There were 3.5% of subjects in the placebo group, 2.2% of subjects in the XEN1101 10 mg group, 13.7% of subjects in the XEN1101 20 mg group, and 15.8% of subjects in the XEN1101 25 mg group that had an AE leading to treatment discontinuation.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">Mr. Ian Mortimer, Xenon’s President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We believe that the X-TOLE topline data support a very attractive clinical profile for XEN1101 with desirable attributes that help differentiate it from other ASMs and suggest XEN1101 could be highly competitive in the future adult focal seizure market. Of importance, the XEN1101 efficacy data are especially compelling given that approximately 50% of the subjects in X-TOLE were using three concomitant ASMs, suggesting that this was potentially an even more challenging patient population than previous studies with other ASMs. Additionally, these data signal activity of XEN1101 in the central nervous system, which further supports our plans to develop XEN1101 in other indications, including major depressive disorder and other types of epilepsy.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Xenon intends to gather input from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies to continue planning the future clinical development of XEN1101. In addition, the X-TOLE open-label extension, which has been expanded to three years, is expected to generate important long-term data for XEN1101.</p>

Guardant Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: GH), a leading precision oncology company, has initiated the Observation of ResiduAl Cancer with Liquid biopsy Evaluation (ORACLE) study, a 1,000-patient prospective, observational, multi-center study designed to evaluate the performance of its Guardant Reveal™ liquid biopsy test to predict cancer recurrence after curative intent treatment, across 11 solid tumor types.

“For oncologists managing patients with early-stage cancer, there is a need for additional tools to help make informed decisions regarding risk for recurrence and benefit of adjuvant therapies, and avoid under- or over-treatment,” said Craig Eagle, MD, Guardant Health Chief Medical Officer. “This study is exciting because it will evaluate the first blood-only minimal residual disease (MRD) assay in additional tumor types, and set the stage to identify opportunities for this technology to improve patient care.”

The study will analyze circulating tumor (ctDNA) status from blood samples of patients with early-stage cancer, using the Guardant Reveal test after the end of treatment, and during routine follow-up. Participants will be followed until distant recurrence, or up to five years. The ORACLE study adds to currently underway clinical studies (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04068103&amp;esheet=52502670&amp;newsitemid=20211005005283&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=COBRA&amp;index=1&amp;md5=a475b851d57a9b60b5fcd9e181ee02ea"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">COBRA</a>, <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03803553&amp;esheet=52502670&amp;newsitemid=20211005005283&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=ACT-3&amp;index=2&amp;md5=804baca455536debb71c292d802689e9"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">ACT-3</a>, <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04259944&amp;esheet=52502670&amp;newsitemid=20211005005283&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=PEGASUS&amp;index=3&amp;md5=269bc146c0c5527d513cda3c249706c1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">PEGASUS</a>) evaluating the performance of the Guardant Reveal blood test in patients with early-stage cancer.

“Initiating this study adds to the growing body of evidence that will support the expansion of the Guardant Reveal blood test from its first indication of early-stage colorectal cancer to multiple cancer types. We believe our blood-only test can be a powerful and streamlined decision-making tool for oncologists managing patients with early-stage cancers,” said Helmy Eltoukhy, Guardant Health Co-CEO. “The ORACLE study exemplifies our commitment to further demonstrating the utility of our blood tests to improve long-term clinical outcomes.”

The Guardant Reveal test is the first blood-only liquid biopsy test that detects residual and recurrent disease from a simple blood draw. The test detects ctDNA in blood after surgery, to identify patients with residual disease who may benefit most from adjuvant therapy, and to detect recurrence months earlier than current standard-of-care methods.<sup>1-6</sup> The commercially available test achieves high sensitivity (91%)<sup>7</sup> for detecting ctDNA by simultaneously interrogating both genomic alterations and methylation. The first indication of the test is colorectal cancer, with additional cancer types to follow.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) announced it has submitted data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support use of a booster shot of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in individuals 18 years of age and older.

The submission includes recent results from the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE 2 study that found a booster of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine given 56 days after the primary dose provided 94 percent protection against symptomatic (moderate to severe/critical) COVID-19 in the U.S. (CI, 58%-100%) and 100 percent protection (CI, 33%-100%) against severe/critical COVID-19, at least 14 days post-booster vaccination.

Also part of the submission is Phase 1/2a data showing that when a booster of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was given six months after the single shot, antibody levels increased nine-fold one week after the booster and continued to climb to 12-fold higher four weeks after the booster. The vaccine, when given as a booster or primary dose, was generally well-tolerated.

“Our clinical program has found that a booster of our COVID-19 vaccine increases levels of protection for those who have received our single-shot vaccine to 94 percent. We look forward to our discussions with the FDA and other health authorities to support their decisions regarding boosters,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. “At the same time, we continue to recognize that a single-shot COVID-19 vaccine that provides strong and long-lasting protection remains a crucial component to vaccinating the global population.”

Last month, the Company released data reinforcing the strong and long-lasting protection of its COVID-19 vaccine. The largest real-world evidence study for a COVID-19 vaccine reported to date in the U.S. demonstrated stable vaccine effectiveness of 79 percent (CI, 77%-80%) for COVID-19-related infections and 81 percent (CI, 79%-84%) for COVID-19-related hospitalizations. There was no evidence of reduced effectiveness over the study duration conducted from March to July 31, 2021. Comparable vaccine effectiveness was demonstrated when the study was extended to August 31, 2021, including when the Delta variant became dominant in the U.S. Sequencing data were not available for analysis.

These data were consistent with the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial, where strong protection against severe/critical disease and death was observed at least 28 days post-final vaccination.

Interim results from a Phase 1/2a sub-study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July demonstrated that both humoral (antibody) and cellular (T-cell) immune responses generated by the Johnson & Johnson single-shot COVID-19 vaccine were strong and stable through eight months after immunization, the length of time evaluated in the study. These peer-reviewed data provide further and deeper insights into the durable humoral and cellular immune responses elicited by the single-shot Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, thus offering potentially a dual mechanism of protection against COVID-19 disease, including against disease caused by the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) and other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The cellular immune response induced by the Company’s AdVac® platform is strong and plays a role in both protection and durability.

The Company plans to submit the data to other regulators, the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) worldwide to inform decision-making on local vaccine administration strategies, as needed.

The Johnson & Johnson single-shot COVID-19 vaccine, developed by its Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, received an EUA in the United States on February 27, 2021 and Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) by the European Commission on March 11. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued Emergency Use Listing on March 12, and the Company received an interim recommendation by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization for the WHO on March 17. Many more authorizations have been granted in countries worldwide, and regulatory submissions are ongoing.

Authorized Use
The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for use in the U.S. under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 18 years of age and older.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WHAT SHOULD YOU MENTION TO YOUR VACCINATION PROVIDER BEFORE YOU GET THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE?
Tell the vaccination provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have any allergies
have a fever
have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner
are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant
are breastfeeding
have received another COVID-19 vaccine
have ever fainted in association with an injection

WHO SHOULD NOT GET THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE?
You should not get the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine if you:

had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine.
HOW IS THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE GIVEN?
The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine will be given to you as an injection into the muscle. The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination schedule is a single dose.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE?
Side effects that have been reported with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine include:

Injection site reactions: pain, redness of the skin, and swelling
General side effects: headache, feeling very tired, muscle aches, nausea, fever
Swollen lymph nodes
Unusual feeling in the skin (such as tingling or a crawling feeling) (paresthesia), decreased feeling or sensitivity, especially in the skin (hypoesthesia)
Persistent ringing in the ears (tinnitus)
Diarrhea, vomiting
Severe Allergic Reactions
There is a remote chance that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received your vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include:

Difficulty breathing
Swelling of your face and throat
A fast heartbeat
A bad rash all over your body
Dizziness and weakness
Blood Clots with Low Levels of Platelets
Blood clots involving blood vessels in the brain, lungs, abdomen, and legs along with low levels of platelets (blood cells that help your body stop bleeding), have occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In people who developed these blood clots and low levels of platelets, symptoms began approximately one to two weeks following vaccination. Reporting of these blood clots and low levels of platelets has been highest in females ages 18 through 49 years. The chance of having this occur is remote. You should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine:

Shortness of breath
Chest pain
Leg swelling
Persistent abdominal pain
Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision
Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of the injection
These may not be all the possible side effects of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. Serious and unexpected effects may occur. The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is still being studied in

Guillain Barré Syndrome
Guillain Barré syndrome (a neurological disorder in which the body’s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis) has occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In most of these people, symptoms began within 42 days following receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low. You should seek medical attention right away if you develop any of the following symptoms after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine:

Weakness of tingling sensations, especially in the legs or arms, that’s worsening and spreading to other parts of the body
Difficulty walking
Difficulty with facial movements, including speaking, chewing, or swallowing
Double vision or inability to move eyes
Difficulty with bladder control or bowel function
WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS?
If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1, or go to the nearest hospital.

Call the vaccination provider or your healthcare provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","&nbsp;

Sage Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SAGE) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced new data from the LANDSCAPE and NEST clinical development program evaluating the efficacy and safety of zuranolone for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and postpartum depression (PPD) presented at the 34th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) Congress, taking place October 2-5, 2021. Presentations include data from the WATERFALL Study, a Phase 3 placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of zuranolone 50 mg in adults 18 to 64 years old with MDD as well as the open-label SHORELINE Study in MDD and cross-study analyses from across the LANDSCAPE and NEST programs. Collectively, the studies show reductions in depressive symptoms with zuranolone-treated patients such as consistent improvements in depressive mood, as well as rapid onset of significant effect by Day 3. Zuranolone has demonstrated a consistent safety profile in the totality of clinical data to date, with no evidence of withdrawal, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, euphoria, or sleep disruption; symptoms that are typically the cause of treatment discontinuation with current standard of care antidepressants. In pooled analyses from the LANDSCAPE and NEST programs of SF-36v2, a patient self-reported measure of general health, zuranolone treatment led to rapid improvement in quality of life and overall health across all functioning and well-being domains at Day 15 and across all domains at Day 42 (Day 45 in ROBIN Study).

Additional data presented summarized clinical data from the literature on onset of effect of current treatment options in MDD demonstrating there is a need for new treatment options with the potential for rapid response.

“The collection of data presented at ECNP showcases the LANDSCAPE and NEST programs, in totality, where we have seen a very consistent and differentiated profile for zuranolone. The efficacy data across the clinical development program have demonstrated a rapid onset of activity, consistent reductions in depressive symptoms and a two-week treatment regimen that may offer the potential to treat-as-needed. The data also include a robust safety database with more than 3,500 patients treated, showing that zuranolone has been well tolerated to date,” said Steve Kanes, M.D., PhD., chief medical officer at Sage Therapeutics. “We believe these data represent the potential for a benefit-risk profile for zuranolone that may be differentiated from the most prescribed depression drugs on the market, and may be welcomed by patients, if approved.”

“The data presented at ECNP further emphasize that zuranolone dosed once daily for two weeks has the potential to produce a rapid reduction of depressive symptoms within days for both major depressive disorder and postpartum depression and a differentiated, well-characterized safety profile,” said Katherine Dawson, M.D., head of the Therapeutics Development Unit at Biogen. “Collectively these data represent positive steps in Biogen’s journey to expand our footprint in neuropsychiatry and innovate for the millions of people who need new options to address mental health conditions.”

“The efficacy and safety data observed with zuranolone across the LANDSCAPE and NEST clinical program indicate that, if approved, it may offer the potential for people with MDD and PPD to experience a rapid reduction in their depressive symptoms without side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction and sleep disruption that are often associated with treatments currently on the market,” said Anita H. Clayton, M.D., Chair of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences, University of Virginia School of Medicine. “Patients in the trials are also indicating through the patient outcome measures that zuranolone helped with their overall well-being.”

Data presented at ECNP:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Oral Presentation: </strong>Zuranolone in major depressive disorder: topline results from the Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled WATERFALL Study</li>
 	<li><strong>Poster Presentation Title:</strong> Zuranolone 30 mg in major depressive disorder: results through 1-year follow-up from the Phase 3, open-label, SHORELINE Study</li>
 	<li><strong>Poster Presentation:</strong> Exploring the rapidity of treatment effect for current treatment options for major depressive disorder</li>
</ul>
<strong>Conference Call Information</strong>
Sage will host a conference call and webcast Monday, October 4, 2021 at 8:00am ET to review the totality of the data presented at ECNP from the zuranolone clinical development program. Anita Clayton, M.D., Chair of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences, University of Virginia School of Medicine will join the conference call to discuss data presented at the ECNP Congress in more detail.

The live webcast can be accessed on the investor page of Sage's website at investor.sagerx.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on Sage's website approximately two hours after the completion of the event and will be archived for up to 30 days.

<strong>About the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)</strong>
The Short Form health survey (SF-36) is an often-used, well-researched, and self-reported measure of general health. The SF-36 uses 36 questions, covering eight domains of health, to assess the general health status and quality of life at the individual level in clinical practice and research, and at the population level for health policy evaluations. The SF-36 has been used in thousands of research studies, and while it was originally designed as a generic health measure, it is also applied to specific disease populations. The SF-36 represents an international benchmark for health outcomes measurement and has been used as efficacy endpoints in clinical trials.

<strong>About Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</strong>
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common but serious mood disorder in which people experience depressive symptoms that impair their social, occupational, educational, or other important functioning, such as a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, consistently for at least a two-week period. It is estimated that approximately 19 million people in the U.S. and more than 250 million people worldwide suffer from MDD each year. While antidepressants are widely used to treat MDD, large-scale studies have demonstrated the need for additional therapies with a differentiated profile.

<strong>About Zuranolone</strong>
Zuranolone (SAGE-217/BIIB125) is a once-daily, two-week, investigational drug in development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and postpartum depression (PPD). Zuranolone is an investigational oral neuroactive steroid (NAS) GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM). The GABA system is the major inhibitory signaling pathway of the brain and central nervous system and contributes to regulating brain function. Zuranolone has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration.

Zuranolone is being evaluated as a potential rapid-acting treatment for PPD and MDD in the NEST and LANDSCAPE clinical trial programs. The two development programs include multiple studies examining use of zuranolone in several thousand patients with a variety of dosing, clinical endpoints, and treatment paradigms. The LANDSCAPE program includes five studies of zuranolone in patients with MDD. Data have been reported from three studies of zuranolone 30 mg in patients with MDD (MDD-201B, MOUNTAIN Study and the 30 mg cohort from the ongoing SHORELINE Study), and one study of zuranolone 50 mg in patients with MDD (WATERFALL Study) in addition to an interim cut of the zuranolone 50mg cohort of the ongoing SHORELINE Study. Two additional studies evaluating zuranolone 50 mg in patients with MDD are expected to read out by the end of 2021 (CORAL Study and another cut of the 50mg cohort of the SHORELINE Study).

The NEST Program includes two placebo-controlled studies of zuranolone in patients with PPD. Positive data from the ROBIN Study (zuranolone 30 mg) have been previously reported. The SKYLARK Study (zuranolone 50 mg) is anticipated to readout by mid-2022.

The programs are designed to generate data to support a potential NDA filing as efficiently as possible. If successful, LANDSCAPE and NEST may support paths to approval with three distinct opportunities to address patient needs: PPD, acute rapid response therapy in MDD when co-initiated with a new standard antidepressant, and as-needed treatment of MDD.

<div class=""span8"">

For the first time in 20 years, a new therapy for sickle cell disease is to be made available on the NHS. Crizanlizumab (Adakveo, Novartis) is recommended by NICE as a treatment option for preventing recurrent sickle cell crises in people aged 16 or over.  More than 300 people a year are expected to receive the treatment via a Managed Access Agreement (MAA), increasing to more than 450 people in subsequent years.

Sickle cell disease is a blood disorder characterised by red blood cells that become sickle-shaped, leading to clumping and blockages in the small blood vessels. These blockages can cause a loss of blood flow and severe pain in episodes known as vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), or sickle cell crises. The frequency and severity of VOCs is unpredictable, and each episode can take days or weeks to recover, sometimes requiring hospitalisation.

Current treatments to prevent sickle cell crises include a tablet called hydroxycarbamide and regular blood transfusions, which are not always effective for people with severe disease. Crizanlizumab is a new intravenous treatment option that can be taken on its own or alongside hydroxycarbamide.

Clinical evidence suggests that people treated with crizanlizumab have significantly fewer sickle cell crises in a year than those receiving other standard treatment options.

However, there is high uncertainty about the long-term effectiveness of the treatment and the cost-effectiveness, so crizanlizumab could not be recommended for routine use on the NHS at this stage. Instead, the committee has recommended the treatment through the MAA with the NHS, which will allow people to access crizanlizumab while additional data is collected through clinical trials to address these uncertainties.

This decision was based on crizanlizumab being cost effective according to the terms of the MAA. The committee’s decision-making also took into account the high unmet need for treatments for sickle cell disease and NICE’s aim of reducing health inequalities.

<strong>Meindert Boysen, deputy chief executive and director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation at NICE, said:</strong> “Sickle cell disease can be a debilitating condition that has a huge impact on patients’ quality of life. Yet treatment for sickle cell disease has been limited for years, and there has been a lack of treatments for patients whose lives are affected by the condition. Crizanlizumab is an innovative treatment which has shown the potential to improve hundreds of lives, and we are delighted to be able to recommend it as the first new treatment for sickle cell disease in two decades. We don’t yet know whether the benefits will translate in longer-term outcomes, and we look forward to seeing what the data collected through this managed access agreement will uncover about its benefits for the future.”

Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: KLDO), a clinical-stage biotech company with a differentiated, small-molecule approach to treating inflammatory conditions and diseases by selectively targeting the resident microbiome to restore gut-immune homeostasis, today announced topline data from the non-IND/CTA clinical study evaluating KB295, a novel Microbiome Metabolic Therapy (MMT™), in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). The primary objective of safety and tolerability was achieved as KB295 was well tolerated and no safety concerns were observed. In the study, subjects receiving KB295 experienced a reduction in three biomarkers, fecal calprotectin (FCP), fecal lactoferrin, and FimH that are known to be associated with UC disease activity. These results are complemented by preclinical studies conducted with Kaleido’s unique translational <em>ex vivo</em> platform using human donor-derived microbiome communities.

<strong>Highlights from the Topline KB295 Dataset for Mild-to-Moderate in UC</strong>

<em>Clinical Data Observed at the End of an Eight-Week Intake Period</em>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Achieved primary objective of safety and tolerability with KB295 being well tolerated across subjects (n=12) with no product-emergent serious adverse events reported</li>
 	<li>Observed a meaningful reduction in three key biomarkers: FCP, fecal lactoferrin, and FimH, known to be strongly correlated with inflammation and disease activity:
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li>Median FCP levels decreased by 69% in subjects with evaluable FCP (n=11), and 74% in subjects identified as responders (8 of 11); responders were defined as those subjects with FCP reduction greater than 50%</li>
 	<li>Fecal lactoferrin decreased by a median of 69% in subjects with currently available samples (n=6), including five out of six subjects with a reduction of at least 50%</li>
 	<li>FimH decreased by a median of 93% in subjects evaluated with currently available samples (n=5)</li>
 	<li>Further fecal lactoferrin and FimH analysis is expected as additional subject samples become available</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<em>Pre-Clinical Data from Ex-Vivo Studies</em>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><em>Ex-vivo</em> data demonstrated community-wide changes and desired modulation of multiple remission-associated taxa</li>
 	<li>Total short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production increased in <em>ex-vivo</em> studies to levels that are pharmacologically relevant to UC</li>
</ul>
<em>Anticipated Milestones</em>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Observations from both preclinical and clinical data support the Company’s plans to initiate a phase 2 study, under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and Clinical Trial Application (CTA), with KB295 for mild-to-moderate UC patients in the first half of 2022</li>
 	<li>Manufacturing and toxicity work has commenced to support future studies under CTA and IND applications</li>
</ul>
“The data we shared today highlight the potential of our MMT platform and its ability to work with a person’s microbiome as opposed to replacing it,” said Dan Menichella, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kaleido. “Ulcerative colitis is largely driven by gut microbiome dysbiosis, and KB295 modulates microbiome composition and metabolic output, thereby driving immune activity both locally and systemically to restore gut immune homeostasis in those with UC. We are excited about the data package and look forward to advancing KB295 in a phase 2 ulcerative colitis study under an IND.”

KB295 was evaluated in an exploratory, open-label, single arm non-IND clinical study in subjects with mild-to-moderate UC. Subjects received KB295 for eight weeks, titrated up to 40g twice daily and then entered a two-week follow-up period. The study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KB295 with other exploratory assessments including changes in microbiome composition, SCFA levels in stool and biomarkers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin and FimH). The trial was originally designed to enroll 30 subjects at a single site in Ireland, however, due to COVID-19 related enrollment impacts, 12 subjects were enrolled, primarily from Ireland. Primary pharmacology data were generated with Kaleido’s unique translational <em>ex vivo</em> platform using human donor-derived microbiome communities as well as microbiome and biomarker read-outs on the currently available samples from the first six subjects that entered the study.

UC is an inflammatory bowel disease that can cause debilitating symptoms, including abdominal pain, bowel urgency and diarrhea. Evidence shows that a feature of UC is alteration of the gut microbiome, including an increase in inflammatory bacteria and decrease in commensal microbe diversity and short chain fatty acids, which interfere with the normal immune response. Major scientific advances have demonstrated that the microbiome is a legitimate intervention target in the management of this disease.

<strong>Conference Call and Webcast Information</strong>
Kaleido management will host a conference call with accompanying slides today at 8:00 a.m. ET. Analysts and investors are invited to participate in the conference call by dialing (833) 423-0448 from the U.S. and Canada or (956) 394-3566 internationally and using the conference ID 5754389.

The program will also feature presentations by Bruce Sands, M.D., Dr. Burrill B. Crohn Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Ruth Tal-Singer, Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of the COPD Foundation.

<strong>About Ulcerative Colitis</strong>
Ulcerative colitis (“UC”) is a chronic disease of the large intestine, in which the lining of the colon becomes inflamed and develops tiny open sores, or ulcers. Those ulcers produce pus and mucus, cause abdominal pain and result in the need to frequently empty the colon. Although UC is the result of several factors that are not yet well understood, abnormal immune response, genetics, microbiome, and environmental factors all contribute to the disease. UC can occur at any age, though most people are diagnosed prior to their mid-30s. In the United States, approximately one million people are affected with UC, and reported symptoms include loose stool and urgent bowel movements, bloody stool, abdominal cramps and pain, and persistent diarrhea accompanied by abdominal pain and blood in the stool.

There is no known curative treatment for UC. Treatment is multifaceted and includes the use of medication, alterations in diet and nutrition, and sometimes surgical procedures to repair or remove affected portions of a patient’s gastrointestinal tract. Several types of medication can be used to suppress UC symptoms (induce remission) and decrease the frequency of symptom flares (maintain remission) including anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and biologics. UC is often a progressive disease meaning that over time patients respond less to a specific medication and need to progress to other treatments. Current therapies, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and biologics can also be associated with significant side effects. There is a clinical need for new therapeutic options with durable efficacy and an improved safety profile.

<strong>About Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (MMT™)</strong>
Kaleido’s Microbiome Metabolic Therapies, or MMTs, are designed to drive the function and distribution of the microbiome’s existing microbes in order to decrease or increase the production of metabolites, or to advantage or disadvantage certain bacteria in the microbiome community. The Company’s initial MMT candidates are targeted, synthetic glycans that are orally administered, have limited systemic exposure, and are selectively metabolized by enzymes in the microbiome. Kaleido utilizes its discovery and development platform to study MMTs in microbiome samples to rapidly advance MMT candidates into clinical studies in healthy subjects and patients. These human clinical studies may be conducted under regulations supporting research with food, evaluating safety and tolerability and impact on the microbiome. For MMT candidates that are developed as therapeutics, the Company currently conducts and will conduct clinical trials under an Investigational New Drug (IND) or regulatory equivalent outside the U.S., often in Phase 2 or later development.

Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Baylis Medical Company Inc. for an upfront payment of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.75 billion</span>, subject to closing adjustments. The acquisition will expand the Boston Scientific electrophysiology and structural heart product portfolios to include the radiofrequency (RF) NRG<sup>®</sup> and VersaCross<sup>®</sup> Transseptal Platforms as well as a family of guidewires, sheaths and dilators used to support left heart access. These platforms have advanced transseptal puncture and are clinically proven to enhance safety, efficacy and efficiency when crossing the atrial septum to deliver therapies in the left side of the heart, such as atrial fibrillation ablation, left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) and mitral valve interventions.<sup>i</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>ii</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>iii</sup> Baylis Medical Company is expected to generate net sales approaching <span class=""xn-money"">$200 million</span> in 2022, having achieved double-digit year-over-year sales growth during each of the past five years.

""The talented and innovative Baylis Medical Company team, combined with these transseptal platforms, will enhance our efforts to improve procedural efficiencies with physician tools designed to make left atrial access safer and more predictable, with a focus on patient outcomes,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Mike Mahoney</span>, chairman and chief executive officer, Boston Scientific. ""A leader in many of the fastest growing markets in our industry, we believe that Baylis Medical Company will add meaningful revenue, operating income, and new research and development capabilities across multiple Boston Scientific businesses, while complementing existing offerings within our electrophysiology and structural heart portfolios.""

Physicians have traditionally relied on a mechanical needle to pass through the septum and access the left side of the heart, which can present safety concerns and placement challenges based on varying patient anatomy. Rather than relying solely on mechanical force, the Baylis Medical Company platforms facilitate predictable and safe transseptal access by using RF energy – a method shown to increase efficiency, and improve the safety and efficacy of transseptal puncture during left heart procedures.<sup>i,ii,iii</sup> The new VersaCross platform further streamlines transseptal crossing procedures and therapy delivery by offering the same benefits while eliminating potential wire and sheath exchanges, which may help mitigate risks during procedures.

""As a leading innovator in left heart access solutions, we develop advancements that help physicians deliver critical, high-precision therapies, which raise the standard of care for patients,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Kris Shah</span>, president, Baylis Medical Company. ""We look forward to making these life-changing technologies available to more patients across the globe through the significant commercial reach of Boston Scientific.""

Baylis Medical Company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the NRG platform in 2008 and the technology has since been used in more than one million procedures. The company received FDA 510(k) clearance for the VersaCross platform in 2020. These platforms are complemented by the company's family of guidewires, sheaths and dilators, which are designed for use in left-sided diagnostic, ablation, mitral and LAAC procedures.

The transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to be approximately <span class=""xn-money"">one cent</span> accretive to adjusted earnings per share in 2022 and increasingly accretive thereafter. On a GAAP basis, the transaction is expected to be less accretive, or dilutive as the case may be, in 2022 and less dilutive or increasingly accretive thereafter, as the case may be, due to amortization expense and acquisition-related net charges.

A phase 3 study of a trastuzumab biosimilar candidate (TX05) and reference product (Herceptin) has demonstrated equivalence in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early stage breast cancer, according to findings presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2021.
<figure class=""d-block undefined figure""><a href=""https://cdn.sanity.io/files/0vv8moc6/biosimilars/7380b3e5228b8cda4c6617f13b3d752b559a04bd.jpg/tanvex%20logo.jpg"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""media-image"" src=""https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/biosimilars/7380b3e5228b8cda4c6617f13b3d752b559a04bd-658x140.jpg/tanvex%20logo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;auto=format"" alt=""Tanvex TX05 Biosimilar Trastuzumab Findings"" /></a></figure>
The trial enrolled patients (N = 809) in the neoadjuvant, or presurgery, setting. Of those, 674 were evaluable. The primary end point was therapeutic equivalence based on pathologic complete response (pCR), or absence of residual cancer, following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability.

Patients were recruited at 124 treatment centers in 10 countries, including Russia, Hungary, Chile, and India. They received four 3-week cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide and were then randomized to four 3-week cycles of paclitaxel and TX05 or the reference biosimilar (TRA, as available in the European Union). Investigators said close to 100% of patients completed all planned cycles of trastuzumab therapy.

They said the proportions of patients meeting pCR criteria for equivalence were “highly similar” between the TX05 (48.8%) and TRA (45.3%) cohorts (risk ratio, 1.0783).

They also said equivalence was observed when patients from both cohorts were stratified according to cancer stage and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. ECOG is a means of classifying patients according to the level of disability they suffer as a result of their cancer, with zero representing the highest functionality.

ORR was also highly similar between the TX05 (84.3%) and TRA (85.0%) groups, and findings for patients with complete response, partial response, and stable disease were also highly similar between cohorts. The same was true for pharmacodynamics, authors of the study said.

“In all sensitivity analyses, including a 'tipping point' analysis, the 95% CI of the risk ratio was completely contained within the predefined interval,” they wrote.

Safety analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was confined to cycles 5 through 8 of the treatment, as this was the period during which patients received trastuzumab. The investigators said 62.4% of patients experienced TEAEs with TX05 vs 62.5% of patients with TRA, which they said was similar and demonstrative of biosimilarity for TX05.

The most common TEAEs were musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system and gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, and investigative-related and administration-site conditions.

“Overall, the TX05 study treatment was well tolerated. The safety profile was consistent with the known profile of TRA with no significant safety findings seen in the study,” the authors wrote.

“The results of this study support that there is no clinically meaningful difference between TX05 and [TRA],” they said, adding that based on pharmacokinetic similarity, it was possible to conclude that TX05 is also highly similar to the US version of reference trastuzumab.

The study was sponsored by Tanvex BioPharma USA, which is the company developing TX05 for market.

Preliminary results from the phase 3 study concerning just pCR were released in February 2021.

<em>The court battle between AbbVie and Alvotech could be a defining victory in the struggle to bring biosimilar versions of adalimumab to market, but a yearlong court process must play out first.</em>
<div class=""ad-box""></div>
<div class=""block-content mt-3"">
<div>
<div>

A high-concentration, citrate-free biosimilar of adalimumab (AVT02) proposed by Alvotech of Reykjavik, Iceland, would not come to market before October 2022, a year from now, under a court agreement.

Facing litigation from AbbVie, the Lake Bluff, Illinois-based maker of the original adalimumab (Humira), Alvotech has sought to reduce the number of Humira patents it has to fight to get its biosimilar candidate to market in the United States.

In 2020, AbbVie had annual revenues approaching $20 billion for Humira, an often life-changing product approved for chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and psoriasis.

AbbVie originally “asserted” or claimed potential infringement of 62 patents related to adalimumab, and Alvotech countered that just <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/view/alvotech-files-suit-to-invalidate-humira-patents"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener"">4 adalimumab patents</a> are of substance in the dispute over AVT02.

The District Court for the Northern District of Illinois has denied a motion by Alvotech to have the court venue changed to the Eastern District of Virginia, where the company thought it could get a speedier, more favorable decision.

The court has also whittled down the number of adalimumab patents that will be litigated in this round to 10, vs the 62 that AbbVie asserted and the 4 that Alvotech has contended are appropriate to address.

A scheduling order issued by the court in September 2021 sets forth the procedure for getting to a decision in the case by October 2022. This allows for hearings on the parties’ claims and counter claims about infringement and enforceability of the adalimumab patent portfolio, a discovery process that extends through June 2022, followed by a trial set for most of August 2022.

According to the court document, AbbVie will restrict its case to the 10 patents identified by the court and will await the court’s decision before requesting an injunction to prevent Alvotech from making use of any patented intellectual property related to adalimumab.

The scheduling document also states that Alvotech has “agreed not to launch AVT02 in the United States prior to the issuance of the court’s decision.”

There are multiple biosimilars of adalimumab already approved, although these are lower-concentration products, and settlements between AbbVie and the respective biosimilar companies will prevent any of these biosimilars from coming to market before 2023.

Alvotech proposes to bring a 100 mg/mL, citrate-free version of adalimumab to market to capitalize on the growing market dominance of this concentration that AbbVie enjoys almost exclusively.

Adalimumab can cause a severe, burning sensation upon administration, which patients may have to endure with multiple monthly injections. Citrate is used to stabilize the pH of adalimumab, and the citrate-free version uses a different buffer that doesn’t cause the same burning and pain that patients experience. This can make citrate-free adalimumab much more popular.

Adalimumab biosimilars have encountered fewer market barriers in the European Union, and during the third quarter of 2021, Celltrion Healthcare aimed to launch its <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/view/celltrion-supports-high-concentration-adalimumab-biosimilar-launch-with-phase-3-trial-data"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener"">own high concentration adalimumab</a> product (Yuflyma) in 7 EU countries.

The company planned to launch Yuflyma in 3 additional EU countries in the fourth quarter of this year. Celltrion has yet to announce a US launch date, and, indeed, has not yet obtained FDA approval for this agent.

Alvotech is seeking an <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/view/alvotech-achieves-milestone-in-bid-to-capture-adalimumab-share"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener"">interchangeable designation</a> for AVT02 which it believes would increase the use of the product in the United States. Interchangeability would allow pharmacists to substitute the biosimilar for Humira without consulting the prescribing physician.

<strong>Related Development</strong>

The US House Judiciary Committee has approved a bill (HR 2884) that would limit the number of patents an originator company could “assert,” or use as grounds for litigation, against a biosimilar developer.

The limits would be contingent on the biosimilar company’s compliance with information exchanges recommended under the biosimilar approval pathway outlined under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.

The bill, which has yet to pass the full House or the Senate, would limit the number of patents that could be asserted to 20. An originator’s ability to file suit over patents that were awarded after the date of reference product approval also would be restricted.

The legislation is intended to address the problem of patent “thickets” that represent formidable barriers to companies that want to bring biosimilars to market. Originator companies may have extensive patent portfolios. AbbVie has as many as 136 patents on its adalimumab product which have forced rival companies to settle for delayed market entry pacts with AbbVie rather than risk years of costly litigation.

A <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/view/patent-thickets-are-not-the-obstacle-they-appear-to-be-bio-patent-counsel-claims"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener"">recent study</a> by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) found that the average number of patents asserted in biosimilar cases is 12, which is well below the 20-patent limit that HR 2884 would impose. However, the number of patents AbbVie has attempted to assert in its case against Alvotech’s proposed adalimumab biosimilar AVT02 vastly exceeds that number.

<em>Positive findings for Coherus BioSciences' ranibizumab candidate (CHS-201) were presented at the Scientific Meeting of the Retina Society, and the company said equivalence end points were met for an on-body injector version of Udenyca (pegfilgrastim).</em>
<div class=""ad-box""></div>

Coherus BioSciences has reached clinical milestones for 2 of its proposed biosimilar products, an on-body injector (OBI) kit for pegfilgrastim and a biosimilar version of ranibizumab, referencing Lucentis.

The company, based in Redwood City, California, is developing a wearable injector kit for its pegfilgrastim biosimilar (Udenyca) that would compete with Amgen’s commercially successful Onpro device, which holds a <a href=""https://www.amgenbiosimilars.com/commitment/-/media/Themes/Amgen/amgenbiosimilars-com/Amgenbiosimilars-com/pdf/USA-CBU-80962_Amgen-2021-Biosimilar-Trends-Report.pdf?#page=6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">51% share </a>of the market for pegfilgrastim and has enjoyed a tailwind from the COVID-19 pandemic, as it has answered the need for injections delivered outside the clinic.

However, the Onpro's share of the market for pegfilgrastim has declined overall from around 62% of the market in the third quarter of 2018. There are no other OBI pegfilgrastim products on the market aside from Neulasta Onpro.

Pegfilgrastim is used to regenerate white blood cells (neutrophils) following chemotherapy, thereby helping to prevent infection resulting from neutropenia (decreased white blood cell count).

Coherus stated also that positive findings demonstrating safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity equivalence were presented recently for the company’s ranibizumab biosimilar candidate (CHS-201), for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The findings for CHS-201 were presented October 1, 2021, at the 54th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Retina Society.

Investigators in the pivotal COLUMBUS-AMD study sought to determine CHS-201/Lucentis biosimilarity in terms of clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in patients with newly diagnosed subfoveal wet AMD.

""These findings reinforce our confidence that CHS-201 delivers outcomes and a safety profile similar to the reference product,” stated Peter K. Kaiser, MD, a professor of ophthalmology at the Cole Eye Institute of Cleveland Clinic.

“Neovascular age-related macular degeneration destroys the sharp, central vision needed to see clearly and can affect daily activities like reading, driving, and watching television. It is responsible for more than 90% of AMD-related severe visual loss, which has a significant deleterious impact on a patient’s quality of life,” he said.

Investigators randomized patients (N = 477) equally to CHS-201 or reference product every 4 weeks for up to 48 weeks. The primary end point was the improvement after 8 weeks in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), as measured by Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. Secondary end points were BCVA change at 48 weeks and the change in foveal center point (FCP) retinal thickness at 48 weeks.

Patients in the study demonstrated a mean BCVA improvement from baseline at 8 weeks with an equal median improvement of 5 ETDRS letters for CHS-201 (mean [SD], 5.1 [7.52) and the reference product (mean, 5.6 [8.63]) cohorts. Investigators said the BCVA findings for CHS-201 were well within the equivalency margins established for demonstrating biosimilarity.

“Patients in both treatment groups experienced similar reductions in FCP and foveal central subfield retinal thickness, as well as total lesion area,” the investigators said.

They added that proportions of patients from both treatment groups with reduced choroidal neovascularization leakage and increased fluid-free macula also were similar.

The frequency of ocular adverse events (AEs), including intraocular inflammation, were comparable between cohorts, and most AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. The investigators said no clinically meaningful differences were identified. Immunogenicity profiles also were comparable between CHS-201 and the reference product.

On October 1, 2021, the FDA accepted Coherus’ biologics license application for CHS-201 and set a decision date of August 2, 2022. The company said that if approved on schedule, the product would be launched in the second half of 2022.

There is 1 <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/biosimilar-approvals"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener"">FDA-approved ranibizumab biosimilar</a> so far. Byooviz, a Samsung Bioepis and Biogen product, was approved in September 2021, although a commercial launch is not anticipated before June 2022.

<strong>Udenyca OBI</strong>

In the trial of the Udenyca OBI, investigators randomized patients (N = 189) equally to OBI followed by prefilled syringe or the reverse.

The company said all pharmacokinetic (PK) bioequivalence primary end points were met, as was the key secondary PK end point of absolute neutrophil count. Investigators said no new safety signals were observed. A 2022 FDA application for marketing approval is planned.

Although the company is seeking FDA approval to market the pegfilgrastim OBI, the Udenyca prefilled syringe was approved in 2018 and launched in January 2019.

<em>Preventing the nocebo effect requires a demonstration of confidence in biosimilars from all health care practitioners, including pharmacists, experts said in a newly published rheumatology treatment guidance document.</em>
<div class=""ad-box""></div>
<div class=""block-content mt-3"">
<div>
<div>

Rheumatology experts from Canada have developed pharmacist guidance for switching patients with rheumatologic disorders to biosimilars, which they hope also will be of use to the pharmacist community outside Canada.

The guidance was developed as Canadian provinces increasingly move toward mandatory switching to biosimilars to save money and improve access to care.

“New classes of antirheumatic drugs including janus kinase inhibitors (JAKs), along with the introduction of biosimilars are presenting more opportunity for therapeutic changes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These changes are often complex due to the nature of the drugs, along with an associated administrative burden,” they wrote. The group included physicians and pharmacists.

<strong>Consensus on Switching</strong>

In developing the guidance, the authors convened a panel of experts moderated by a facilitator and strived for consensus on key switching issues, primarily considerations prior to, during, and after transition to another biologic or JAK.

The panel paid close attention to the risks of the nocebo effect when switching therapies. Nocebo is when outcomes are affected by patient attitudes toward the therapy. The panel strongly recommended that pharmacists could best avoid nocebo by demonstrating confidence in the switch by using positive verbal language.

Consistent messaging from all involved health care providers was also seen as important to avoid this problem. “The participants did not see the value of using a validated tool to screen and assess patient attitudes toward the therapeutic transition as a proxy for potential nocebo,” authors of the guidance wrote.

Although biosimilars are not precise copies of originator drug products, and even originator biologics differ from batch to batch, scientific evidence has shown that “a single switch from a reference to a biosimilar is safe and effective. Additionally, clinical trials assessing switch from a bio-originator to a biosimilar have not demonstrated any loss of efficacy, increase in adverse events, or increased immunogenicity,” the authors wrote.

The group recommended that any concerns about potentially poor outcomes from a transition should be discussed with the prescribing rheumatologist prior to the switch.

<strong>Clinical Considerations</strong>

The authors provided a list of clinical considerations pharmacists should be aware of during a therapeutic switch. These were based on the mechanism of action for each therapeutic category. For example, with the use of tumor necrosis factor–alpha inhibitors, pharmacists should be aware of injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection, or symptoms of congestive heart failure.

After the transition, the best tool available to assess disease activity is a visual analog scale for the assessment of pain, fatigue, and quality of life, the group agreed. Following close behind in the ranking of utility were the RAPID3 (Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3) tool, which is a disease activity index based on a questionnaire, and the Likert Scale, which measures patient agreement with various prewritten statements.

Pain, fatigue, and quality of life are helpful in assessing for primary response, which is whether the patient has any initial benefit from the agent. The pharmacist is best positioned to monitor for these outcomes, the authors wrote, because the patient will likely interact with the pharmacist for refills prior to a follow-up appointment with the rheumatologist.

“Although a lack of peak-response early in treatment is not a particularly concerning, a series of uncontrolled or frequent flare ups as compared to baseline after 3 months of therapy would be cause for immediate referral,” they wrote.

Asked when a pharmacist should refer a patient to the rheumatologist for an earlier-than-scheduled follow up, the group emphasized the seriousness and severity of individual factors such as infection, repeated flare ups, and surgery; it said these should be the basis of such determinations.

“The pharmacist is well positioned to monitor and resolve issues relating to adherence and safety,” the authors wrote.

In their clinical considerations tool, the authors provided a “before starting” checklist to ensure a smooth transition to the substitute agent.

One of the questions considered by the panel but not addressed was how to measure the effectiveness of current therapy vs new therapy. “Participants felt it was inappropriate to attempt this as it may create the impression that we expect a change in effectiveness post-transition. This could lead to a nocebo effect,” the authors wrote.

Results from the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) investigations were presented in poster form at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2021, being held virtually this week. Remsima is a Celltrion product.

In a randomized, controlled trial, investigators enrolled 65 patients (CD, 25; UC, 40) in the IV arm in which they received CT-P13 (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks from week 6 through week 22). At week 30, patients were switched to SC administration every 2 weeks until week 54 (dose 120 mg or 240 mg for patients &lt; 80 kg or = 80 kg, respectively).

<article>Fresenius Kabi, a global healthcare company that specializes in lifesaving medicines and technologies, announced today that its tocilizumab biosimilar candidate MSB11456 successfully met its primary and secondary endpoints in two consecutively conducted clinical trials. The two Phase 1 studies used respectively subcutaneous and intravenous formulations to capture the two different routes of administration to evaluate the tocilizumab biosimilar candidate’s bioequivalence, safety and immunogenicity, in comparison to its reference candidates.

The first Phase 1 study, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to determine the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of MSB11456 following a single subcutaneous injection in healthy subjects, met all primary and secondary endpoints. Pharmacokinetic equivalence of MSB11456 to both the US reference product* and the EU reference medicinal product** was successfully demonstrated. The clinical trial also confirmed the similarity of MSB11456 and the US reference product* and the EU reference medicinal product** at pharmacodynamic? level and no noteworthy differences in safety and immunogenicity were observed across the three treatment groups (MSB11456, US reference product* and EU reference medicinal product**).

The second, more recent Phase 1 study was also a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, safety, immunogenicity and tolerability of MSB11456 versus its US reference product* after a single intravenous infusion in healthy volunteers. This clinical trial met all primary and secondary endpoints. Pharmacokinetic equivalence of MSB11456 and US reference product* was successfully demonstrated and no noteworthy differences in safety and immunogenicity were observed across the two treatment groups (MSB11456 and US reference product*).

“The successful outcomes of both studies represent an important milestone in our commitment to provide high-quality and affordable biosimilar products to more healthcare providers and patients around the world. We continue to expand our biosimilar portfolio to provide affordable alternative solutions for people living with autoimmune diseases,” said Dr. Michael Schönhofen, Member of the Fresenius Kabi Management Board and President Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division.

The company has also initiated a global Phase 3 study with the aim to compare the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of its tocilizumab biosimilar candidate MSB11456 with the EU reference product in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. The enrollment of patients from several countries across Europe has been completed.

A phase 3 study of a trastuzumab biosimilar candidate (TX05) and reference product (Herceptin) has demonstrated equivalence in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early stage breast cancer, according to findings presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2021.
<figure class=""d-block undefined figure""><a href=""https://cdn.sanity.io/files/0vv8moc6/biosimilars/7380b3e5228b8cda4c6617f13b3d752b559a04bd.jpg/tanvex%20logo.jpg"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""media-image"" src=""https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/biosimilars/7380b3e5228b8cda4c6617f13b3d752b559a04bd-658x140.jpg/tanvex%20logo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;auto=format"" alt=""Tanvex TX05 Biosimilar Trastuzumab Findings"" /></a></figure>
The trial enrolled patients (N = 809) in the neoadjuvant, or presurgery, setting. Of those, 674 were evaluable. The primary end point was therapeutic equivalence based on pathologic complete response (pCR), or absence of residual cancer, following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability.

Patients were recruited at 124 treatment centers in 10 countries, including Russia, Hungary, Chile, and India. They received four 3-week cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide and were then randomized to four 3-week cycles of paclitaxel and TX05 or the reference biosimilar (TRA, as available in the European Union). Investigators said close to 100% of patients completed all planned cycles of trastuzumab therapy.

They said the proportions of patients meeting pCR criteria for equivalence were “highly similar” between the TX05 (48.8%) and TRA (45.3%) cohorts (risk ratio, 1.0783).

They also said equivalence was observed when patients from both cohorts were stratified according to cancer stage and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. ECOG is a means of classifying patients according to the level of disability they suffer as a result of their cancer, with zero representing the highest functionality.

ORR was also highly similar between the TX05 (84.3%) and TRA (85.0%) groups, and findings for patients with complete response, partial response, and stable disease were also highly similar between cohorts. The same was true for pharmacodynamics, authors of the study said.

“In all sensitivity analyses, including a 'tipping point' analysis, the 95% CI of the risk ratio was completely contained within the predefined interval,” they wrote.

Safety analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was confined to cycles 5 through 8 of the treatment, as this was the period during which patients received trastuzumab. The investigators said 62.4% of patients experienced TEAEs with TX05 vs 62.5% of patients with TRA, which they said was similar and demonstrative of biosimilarity for TX05.

The most common TEAEs were musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system and gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, and investigative-related and administration-site conditions.

“Overall, the TX05 study treatment was well tolerated. The safety profile was consistent with the known profile of TRA with no significant safety findings seen in the study,” the authors wrote.

“The results of this study support that there is no clinically meaningful difference between TX05 and [TRA],” they said, adding that based on pharmacokinetic similarity, it was possible to conclude that TX05 is also highly similar to the US version of reference trastuzumab.

The study was sponsored by Tanvex BioPharma USA, which is the company developing TX05 for market.

Preliminary results from the phase 3 study concerning just pCR were released in February 2021.

<em>The court battle between AbbVie and Alvotech could be a defining victory in the struggle to bring biosimilar versions of adalimumab to market, but a yearlong court process must play out first.</em>

A high-concentration, citrate-free biosimilar of adalimumab (AVT02) proposed by Alvotech of Reykjavik, Iceland, would not come to market before October 2022, a year from now, under a court agreement.

Facing litigation from AbbVie, the Lake Bluff, Illinois-based maker of the original adalimumab (Humira), Alvotech has sought to reduce the number of Humira patents it has to fight to get its biosimilar candidate to market in the United States.

In 2020, AbbVie had annual revenues approaching $20 billion for Humira, an often life-changing product approved for chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and psoriasis.

AbbVie originally “asserted” or claimed potential infringement of 62 patents related to adalimumab, and Alvotech countered that just <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/view/alvotech-files-suit-to-invalidate-humira-patents"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener"">4 adalimumab patents</a> are of substance in the dispute over AVT02.

The District Court for the Northern District of Illinois has denied a motion by Alvotech to have the court venue changed to the Eastern District of Virginia, where the company thought it could get a speedier, more favorable decision.

The court has also whittled down the number of adalimumab patents that will be litigated in this round to 10, vs the 62 that AbbVie asserted and the 4 that Alvotech has contended are appropriate to address.

A scheduling order issued by the court in September 2021 sets forth the procedure for getting to a decision in the case by October 2022. This allows for hearings on the parties’ claims and counter claims about infringement and enforceability of the adalimumab patent portfolio, a discovery process that extends through June 2022, followed by a trial set for most of August 2022.

According to the court document, AbbVie will restrict its case to the 10 patents identified by the court and will await the court’s decision before requesting an injunction to prevent Alvotech from making use of any patented intellectual property related to adalimumab.

The scheduling document also states that Alvotech has “agreed not to launch AVT02 in the United States prior to the issuance of the court’s decision.”

There are multiple biosimilars of adalimumab already approved, although these are lower-concentration products, and settlements between AbbVie and the respective biosimilar companies will prevent any of these biosimilars from coming to market before 2023.

Alvotech proposes to bring a 100 mg/mL, citrate-free version of adalimumab to market to capitalize on the growing market dominance of this concentration that AbbVie enjoys almost exclusively.

Adalimumab can cause a severe, burning sensation upon administration, which patients may have to endure with multiple monthly injections. Citrate is used to stabilize the pH of adalimumab, and the citrate-free version uses a different buffer that doesn’t cause the same burning and pain that patients experience. This can make citrate-free adalimumab much more popular.

Adalimumab biosimilars have encountered fewer market barriers in the European Union, and during the third quarter of 2021, Celltrion Healthcare aimed to launch its <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/view/celltrion-supports-high-concentration-adalimumab-biosimilar-launch-with-phase-3-trial-data"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener"">own high concentration adalimumab</a> product (Yuflyma) in 7 EU countries.

The company planned to launch Yuflyma in 3 additional EU countries in the fourth quarter of this year. Celltrion has yet to announce a US launch date, and, indeed, has not yet obtained FDA approval for this agent.

Alvotech is seeking an <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/view/alvotech-achieves-milestone-in-bid-to-capture-adalimumab-share"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener"">interchangeable designation</a> for AVT02 which it believes would increase the use of the product in the United States. Interchangeability would allow pharmacists to substitute the biosimilar for Humira without consulting the prescribing physician.

<strong>Related Development</strong>

The US House Judiciary Committee has approved a bill (HR 2884) that would limit the number of patents an originator company could “assert,” or use as grounds for litigation, against a biosimilar developer.

The limits would be contingent on the biosimilar company’s compliance with information exchanges recommended under the biosimilar approval pathway outlined under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.

The bill, which has yet to pass the full House or the Senate, would limit the number of patents that could be asserted to 20. An originator’s ability to file suit over patents that were awarded after the date of reference product approval also would be restricted.

The legislation is intended to address the problem of patent “thickets” that represent formidable barriers to companies that want to bring biosimilars to market. Originator companies may have extensive patent portfolios. AbbVie has as many as 136 patents on its adalimumab product which have forced rival companies to settle for delayed market entry pacts with AbbVie rather than risk years of costly litigation.

A <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/view/patent-thickets-are-not-the-obstacle-they-appear-to-be-bio-patent-counsel-claims"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener"">recent study</a> by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) found that the average number of patents asserted in biosimilar cases is 12, which is well below the 20-patent limit that HR 2884 would impose. However, the number of patents AbbVie has attempted to assert in its case against Alvotech’s proposed adalimumab biosimilar AVT02 vastly exceeds that number.

<em>Positive findings for Coherus BioSciences' ranibizumab candidate (CHS-201) were presented at the Scientific Meeting of the Retina Society, and the company said equivalence end points were met for an on-body injector version of Udenyca (pegfilgrastim).</em>

Coherus BioSciences has reached clinical milestones for 2 of its proposed biosimilar products, an on-body injector (OBI) kit for pegfilgrastim and a biosimilar version of ranibizumab, referencing Lucentis.

The company, based in Redwood City, California, is developing a wearable injector kit for its pegfilgrastim biosimilar (Udenyca) that would compete with Amgen’s commercially successful Onpro device, which holds a <a href=""https://www.amgenbiosimilars.com/commitment/-/media/Themes/Amgen/amgenbiosimilars-com/Amgenbiosimilars-com/pdf/USA-CBU-80962_Amgen-2021-Biosimilar-Trends-Report.pdf?#page=6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">51% share </a>of the market for pegfilgrastim and has enjoyed a tailwind from the COVID-19 pandemic, as it has answered the need for injections delivered outside the clinic.

However, the Onpro's share of the market for pegfilgrastim has declined overall from around 62% of the market in the third quarter of 2018. There are no other OBI pegfilgrastim products on the market aside from Neulasta Onpro.

Pegfilgrastim is used to regenerate white blood cells (neutrophils) following chemotherapy, thereby helping to prevent infection resulting from neutropenia (decreased white blood cell count).

Coherus stated also that positive findings demonstrating safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity equivalence were presented recently for the company’s ranibizumab biosimilar candidate (CHS-201), for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The findings for CHS-201 were presented October 1, 2021, at the 54th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Retina Society.

Investigators in the pivotal COLUMBUS-AMD study sought to determine CHS-201/Lucentis biosimilarity in terms of clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in patients with newly diagnosed subfoveal wet AMD.

""These findings reinforce our confidence that CHS-201 delivers outcomes and a safety profile similar to the reference product,” stated Peter K. Kaiser, MD, a professor of ophthalmology at the Cole Eye Institute of Cleveland Clinic.

“Neovascular age-related macular degeneration destroys the sharp, central vision needed to see clearly and can affect daily activities like reading, driving, and watching television. It is responsible for more than 90% of AMD-related severe visual loss, which has a significant deleterious impact on a patient’s quality of life,” he said.

Investigators randomized patients (N = 477) equally to CHS-201 or reference product every 4 weeks for up to 48 weeks. The primary end point was the improvement after 8 weeks in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), as measured by Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. Secondary end points were BCVA change at 48 weeks and the change in foveal center point (FCP) retinal thickness at 48 weeks.

Patients in the study demonstrated a mean BCVA improvement from baseline at 8 weeks with an equal median improvement of 5 ETDRS letters for CHS-201 (mean [SD], 5.1 [7.52) and the reference product (mean, 5.6 [8.63]) cohorts. Investigators said the BCVA findings for CHS-201 were well within the equivalency margins established for demonstrating biosimilarity.

“Patients in both treatment groups experienced similar reductions in FCP and foveal central subfield retinal thickness, as well as total lesion area,” the investigators said.

They added that proportions of patients from both treatment groups with reduced choroidal neovascularization leakage and increased fluid-free macula also were similar.

The frequency of ocular adverse events (AEs), including intraocular inflammation, were comparable between cohorts, and most AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. The investigators said no clinically meaningful differences were identified. Immunogenicity profiles also were comparable between CHS-201 and the reference product.

On October 1, 2021, the FDA accepted Coherus’ biologics license application for CHS-201 and set a decision date of August 2, 2022. The company said that if approved on schedule, the product would be launched in the second half of 2022.

There is 1 <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/biosimilar-approvals"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener"">FDA-approved ranibizumab biosimilar</a> so far. Byooviz, a Samsung Bioepis and Biogen product, was approved in September 2021, although a commercial launch is not anticipated before June 2022.

<strong>Udenyca OBI</strong>

In the trial of the Udenyca OBI, investigators randomized patients (N = 189) equally to OBI followed by prefilled syringe or the reverse.

The company said all pharmacokinetic (PK) bioequivalence primary end points were met, as was the key secondary PK end point of absolute neutrophil count. Investigators said no new safety signals were observed. A 2022 FDA application for marketing approval is planned.

Although the company is seeking FDA approval to market the pegfilgrastim OBI, the Udenyca prefilled syringe was approved in 2018 and launched in January 2019.

<em>Preventing the nocebo effect requires a demonstration of confidence in biosimilars from all health care practitioners, including pharmacists, experts said in a newly published rheumatology treatment guidance document.</em>
<div class=""ad-box""></div>
<div class=""block-content mt-3"">
<div>
<div>

Rheumatology experts from Canada have developed pharmacist guidance for switching patients with rheumatologic disorders to biosimilars, which they hope also will be of use to the pharmacist community outside Canada.

The guidance was developed as Canadian provinces increasingly move toward mandatory switching to biosimilars to save money and improve access to care.

“New classes of antirheumatic drugs including janus kinase inhibitors (JAKs), along with the introduction of biosimilars are presenting more opportunity for therapeutic changes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These changes are often complex due to the nature of the drugs, along with an associated administrative burden,” they wrote. The group included physicians and pharmacists.

<strong>Consensus on Switching</strong>

In developing the guidance, the authors convened a panel of experts moderated by a facilitator and strived for consensus on key switching issues, primarily considerations prior to, during, and after transition to another biologic or JAK.

The panel paid close attention to the risks of the nocebo effect when switching therapies. Nocebo is when outcomes are affected by patient attitudes toward the therapy. The panel strongly recommended that pharmacists could best avoid nocebo by demonstrating confidence in the switch by using positive verbal language.

Consistent messaging from all involved health care providers was also seen as important to avoid this problem. “The participants did not see the value of using a validated tool to screen and assess patient attitudes toward the therapeutic transition as a proxy for potential nocebo,” authors of the guidance wrote.

Although biosimilars are not precise copies of originator drug products, and even originator biologics differ from batch to batch, scientific evidence has shown that “a single switch from a reference to a biosimilar is safe and effective. Additionally, clinical trials assessing switch from a bio-originator to a biosimilar have not demonstrated any loss of efficacy, increase in adverse events, or increased immunogenicity,” the authors wrote.

The group recommended that any concerns about potentially poor outcomes from a transition should be discussed with the prescribing rheumatologist prior to the switch.

<strong>Clinical Considerations</strong>
<figure class=""d-block undefined figure""><a href=""https://cdn.sanity.io/files/0vv8moc6/biosimilars/1d757c80d77f4bfe95ed09c91a1b246fe2b56d51.jpg/RA%20monitoring%20tool.jpg"" target=""_self"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""media-image"" src=""https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/biosimilars/1d757c80d77f4bfe95ed09c91a1b246fe2b56d51-1385x834.jpg/RA%20monitoring%20tool.jpg?fit=crop&amp;auto=format"" /></a><figcaption class=""media-caption figure-caption"">Shown above is a portion of the clinical considerations tool developed by authors of the guidance.</figcaption></figure>
The authors provided a list of clinical considerations pharmacists should be aware of during a therapeutic switch. These were based on the mechanism of action for each therapeutic category. For example, with the use of tumor necrosis factor–alpha inhibitors, pharmacists should be aware of injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection, or symptoms of congestive heart failure.

After the transition, the best tool available to assess disease activity is a visual analog scale for the assessment of pain, fatigue, and quality of life, the group agreed. Following close behind in the ranking of utility were the RAPID3 (Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3) tool, which is a disease activity index based on a questionnaire, and the Likert Scale, which measures patient agreement with various prewritten statements.

Pain, fatigue, and quality of life are helpful in assessing for primary response, which is whether the patient has any initial benefit from the agent. The pharmacist is best positioned to monitor for these outcomes, the authors wrote, because the patient will likely interact with the pharmacist for refills prior to a follow-up appointment with the rheumatologist.

“Although a lack of peak-response early in treatment is not a particularly concerning, a series of uncontrolled or frequent flare ups as compared to baseline after 3 months of therapy would be cause for immediate referral,” they wrote.

Asked when a pharmacist should refer a patient to the rheumatologist for an earlier-than-scheduled follow up, the group emphasized the seriousness and severity of individual factors such as infection, repeated flare ups, and surgery; it said these should be the basis of such determinations.

“The pharmacist is well positioned to monitor and resolve issues relating to adherence and safety,” the authors wrote.

In their clinical considerations tool, the authors provided a “before starting” checklist to ensure a smooth transition to the substitute agent.

One of the questions considered by the panel but not addressed was how to measure the effectiveness of current therapy vs new therapy. “Participants felt it was inappropriate to attempt this as it may create the impression that we expect a change in effectiveness post-transition. This could lead to a nocebo effect,” the authors wrote.

<p align=""justify"">Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. today announced findings of a five-year follow-up study comparing ONTRUZANT<sup>®</sup> (trastuzumab) and reference medicine trastuzumab in early or locally advanced HER2 positive breast cancer. The results, which show comparable cardiac safety profiles and long-term efficacy, will be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2021.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The five-year follow-up results presented at this year’s ESMO is the longest monitoring data of patients treated with a trastuzumab biosimilar for HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer,” said Donghoon Shin, Vice President and Medical and Lifecycle Safety Team Leader at Samsung Bioepis. “This valuable data signifies our continuous dedication in producing high-quality treatments with proven efficacy and safety. We remain committed to patients we serve through our rigorous research and development to ensure quality treatment. We look forward to sharing our data with the oncology community on the usage of biosimilars based on this long-term follow-up data.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The enrolled patients received eight cycles of the biosimilar trastuzumab or the reference medicine concurrently with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant setting. Following the surgery, they received 10 cycles of the biosimilar trastuzumab or reference medicine completing 1 year of treatment. After the Phase 3 study, 367 patients participated in the follow-up study (186 in the biosimilar trastuzumab group and 181 in the reference medicine group) with the median follow-up duration being 68 months from randomization.</p>
<p align=""justify"">During treatment-free follow-up period, the asymptomatic significant left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease rarely occurred for both groups (biosimilar trastuzumab, n=1; reference medicine, n=2) with all three patients recovering with LVEF = 50%. There were no reported cases of symptomatic congestive heart failure or cardiac death reported in either group. Meanwhile, number of events, defined as recurrence, progression, or death, were reported in 32 patients (17.2%) in the biosimilar trastuzumab group and 38 patients (21%) in the reference medicine group (Hazard Ratio (SB3/TRZ) 0.78; 95% CI 0.48-1.25; p=0.30). Five-year event-free survival rates were 82.8% in the biosimilar trastuzumab group and 79.7% in the reference medicine group. Five-year overall survival rates were 93.1% in the biosimilar trastuzumab group and 86.7% in the reference medicine group (Hazard Ratio (SB3/TRZ) 0.62; 95% CI 0.32-1.22; p=0.17). <sup>ii</sup></p>

Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: VYGR), a gene therapy company developing life-changing treatments and next-generation adeno-associated virus (AAV) platform technologies, today announced an agreement through which Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) may exercise options to license novel capsids generated from Voyager’s RNA-driven TRACER<sup>TM</sup> (Tropism Redirection of AAV by Cell-type-specific Expression of RNA) screening technology as part of Pfizer’s efforts to develop, manufacture, and commercialize gene therapies, utilizing two undisclosed transgenes to treat certain neurologic and cardiovascular diseases.

“This transaction highlights the potential of our TRACER platform to identify novel AAV capsids that target desired cells and tissues with greater specificity at lower doses and with fewer off-target risks than conventional AAV serotypes,” said Michael Higgins, Interim CEO of Voyager. “We believe that our TRACER platform has the ability to produce not only enhanced blood-brain-barrier penetrant capsids, but also novel capsids with enhanced tropisms across a diversity of tissues and cell types, offering promise to unlock the fullest potential of gene therapies for a wide array of diseases with unmet medical need.”

""Our collaboration with Voyager will provide Pfizer with access to additional AAV capsids that may help further advance our industry-leading gene therapy portfolio,” said Seng Cheng, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer's Rare Disease Research Unit. “We are impressed with Voyager’s results to date and are enthusiastic about the potential to utilize these novel capsids to help accelerate the development of new therapeutic options for patients living with certain neurologic and cardiovascular diseases.”

Proprietary AAV capsids derived from Voyager’s TRACER platform have demonstrated superior blood-brain-barrier penetration, enhanced cardiac muscle tropism, and increased transgene expression in target tissues compared to conventional AAV capsids as measured in non-human primates (NHPs). Voyager presented data at the 24<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy for one capsid candidate demonstrating more than 1,000-fold increased transgene expression compared to conventional AAV9 across a wide array of brain regions when dosed intravenously in NHPs. Results presented also included another capsid candidate showing significantly enhanced cardiac muscle transduction and dorsal root ganglia de-targeting compared to conventional AAV9. Voyager is performing further screening with its TRACER platform to identify additional proprietary AAV capsids targeting multiple tissue and cell types for use in gene therapies to treat a broad range of diseases.

Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will have the right to evaluate novel capsids selected for central nervous system and cardiac tropisms from Voyager’s TRACER platform and to exercise options to license capsids for exclusive use in Pfizer’s development of AAV gene therapies incorporating two undisclosed transgenes. These transgenes will be distinct from those planned for Voyager’s internal pipeline. Voyager will retain global rights to all licensed capsids for use with other transgenes and to all other applications of its TRACER technology.

Voyager will receive $30 million upfront and is entitled to receive up to $20 million in exercise fees for two options, exercisable by Pfizer within 12 months of signing. In addition, Voyager will be eligible to earn up to $580 million in total development, regulatory, and commercial milestones associated with licensed products incorporating the two undisclosed Pfizer transgenes together with a Voyager licensed capsid. Voyager is also eligible to receive mid- to high-single-digit tiered royalties based on net sales of Pfizer’s products incorporating the licensed capsids.

<strong>About the TRACER AAV Capsid Discovery Platform</strong>
Voyager’s TRACER system is a broadly applicable, RNA-based functional screening platform that allows for rapid in vivo evolution of AAV capsids with enhanced tropisms and cell- and tissue-specific transduction properties in multiple species, including non-human primates (NHPs). Initial data from the first of many libraries screened in NHPs demonstrated the proprietary capsid variants effectively penetrated the blood-brain barrier and achieved widespread biodistribution and transduction of multiple regions of the brain. Separate results have demonstrated the ability of certain capsids to transduce cardiac muscle and to de-target the dorsal root ganglia. Voyager is proceeding with additional capsid campaigns derived from AAV9 and other capsid serotypes to identify novel AAV vectors optimized for specific therapeutic applications.

<strong>About Voyager Therapeutics</strong>
Voyager Therapeutics (Nasdaq: VYGR) is leading the next generation of AAV gene therapy to unlock the potential of the technology to treat devastating diseases. Proprietary capsids born from the Company’s TRACER screening platform are powering a rich early-stage pipeline of new and second-generation programs and may elevate the field to overcome the limitations of conventional gene therapy vectors across neurologic disorders and other therapeutic areas. <a href=""http://voyagertherapeutics.com/"">voyagertherapeutics.com</a> LinkedIn Twitter

<p align=""justify"">Interim results from the first co-administration descriptive study of Sanofi’s Fluzone<sup>®</sup> High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine with Moderna’s COVID-19 mRNA investigational booster dose show that the administration of the vaccines at the same visit had similar immunogenicity responses and a similar safety and tolerability profile compared to each vaccine administered individually.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Fluzone<sup>®</sup> High-Dose Quadrivalent is a high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine, indicated for adults aged 65 and older in the United States and Canada. It is also licensed under the brand name Efluelda<sup>®</sup> in Europe where it is indicated for adults aged 60 and older. Fluzone High-Dose is the only influenza vaccine that has demonstrated reductions in influenza-related complications such as hospitalizations due to cardiovascular events and pneumonia, over 10 consecutive seasons in more than 34 million people aged 65 and older<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“This season, more than ever, it is critical to help protect the older adults, who are at especially high risk for both severe COVID-19 and complications from influenza, which can include heart attacks and strokes</em><em>,</em><em>” says </em><em>Dr</em><em>.</em><em> Michael Greenberg, North America Medical Head for Vaccines at Sanofi.</em> <em>“</em><em>This is the first study to provide supportive evidence for vaccinating against influenza at the same time as a COVID-19 mRNA booster in seniors. These </em><em>positive</em><em> results could facilitate the implementation of Northern Hemisphere influenza and COVID-19 booster </em><em>vaccination </em><em>campaigns, especially in this high-risk population.</em><em>”</em>

These encouraging results reinforce existing co-administration recommendations across the world. Concomitant use of COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines is currently permissible in several countries<sup>4</sup>, including the US<sup>5</sup>, France<sup>6</sup>, the UK<sup>7</sup> and Germany<sup>8</sup>.</p>
<strong>About the study</strong>

This descriptive study is being conducted in the United States and is currently following participants for 6 months for safety. It includes around 300 participants aged 65 years of age and older who received two doses of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine as primary vaccination at least five months prior to enrollment. The study assesses the safety profile and immune response when COVID-19 mRNA investigational booster vaccine (100 mcg dose) and high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine are administered simultaneously. Full results of the study will be published later this year.
<p align=""justify"">The study is sponsored by Sanofi, in partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and with Moderna.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273 vaccine, 100mcg) evaluated in this study is produced by Moderna and administered as a booster at the 100 mcg dose level. Study participants previously received a primary series of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine (two doses) at least five months prior to enrollment. An application by Moderna for a booster indication is currently under review by the U.S. FDA.</p>
<strong>About </strong><strong>Fluzone</strong><strong>®</strong><strong> High-Dose Quadrivalent</strong> <strong>/ </strong><strong>Efluelda</strong><strong>®</strong>
<p align=""justify"">Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent is a high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine, indicated for adults aged 65 and older in North America. It is also licensed under the brand name Efluelda® in Europe where it is indicated for adults aged 60 and older.</p>
<p align=""justify"">This high dose influenza vaccine was first developed and licensed in trivalent formulation in the United States in 2009 for people aged 65 and older. The data from the trivalent formulation are inferred to the quadrivalent formulation after the completion of an immunogenicity study<sup>9</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>10</sup>.</p>
<p align=""justify"">This high dose influenza vaccine is the first and only influenza vaccine proven superior to standard-dose influenza vaccine for the prevention of influenza in adults 65 years of age and older<sup>11</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>12</sup>, who are a major at-risk group for severe COVID-19 and influenza. This vaccine has demonstrated protection beyond flu with a reduction of influenza-related complications such as hospitalizations due to cardiovascular events and pneumonia consistently during 10 influenza seasons in more than 34 million people aged 65 and older<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>13</sup>.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","PharmaTher Holdings Ltd. (the “Company” or “PharmaTher”) (OTCQB: PHRRF) (CSE: PHRM), a clinical-stage psychedelics biotech company, announced today that it has initiated its Phase 2 KET-LID clinical trial of Ketamine for the treatment of Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia in Subjects with Parkinson’s Disease. Patient screening and enrollment is expected to begin in October 2021 with data anticipated in late-Q4 2021.

The Phase 2 KET-LID clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, active placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ketamine in the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease.  The primary and secondary endpoints are the changes in the following: i) total score of the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS), ii) total objective score (III, IV) of the UDysRS, iii) total daily OFF times as assessed by subject- completed 24-hour diaries, and iv) Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total score of part III (motor) and sum score of Questions 4.1 and 4.2 (dyskinesia) in part IV.

As previously announced on May 17, 2021, an IND for the trial has been approved by the FDA.  The Company has completed its clinical trial start-up activities and selection of essential vendors including  project management, central laboratory, clinical supply kits and logistics, data management and biostatistics, and clinical site management and monitoring.  Clinical trial drug product (ketamine) and active placebo (midazolam) have also been obtained.

For further detail about the KET-LID trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04912115), titled “A Multi-Center, Phase II, Randomized, Double-Blind, Prospective, Active Placebo-Controlled Trial of Sub-Anesthetic Intravenous Infusion of Ketamine to Treat Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia in Subjects with Parkinson’s Disease,” please visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04912115?term=PharmaTher&draw=2&rank=1.

If the Phase 2 clinical study is positive, the Company will request a meeting with the FDA to discuss its plan and obtain an agreement to move to a Phase 3 clinical study under the 505(b)2 regulatory pathway in the first half of 2022.

“Initiation of the Phase 2 clinical trial of ketamine to treat Parkinson’s disease, or the KET-LID trial, is a significant milestone for PharmaTher and we are excited about the opportunity to advance a potential new therapeutic solution for Parkinson’s disease patients,” said Fabio Chianelli, CEO of PharmaTher.
There can be no assurance that the FDA will support any potential request for an expedited path to approval or further development for ketamine in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.

Ketamine’s Potential In Parkinson’s Disease       

Ketamine is an FDA-approved N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-modulating drug that is widely used as an anesthetic agent either alone or in combination with other anesthetic agents [Smith et al, 1987; Pacheco et al, 2014]. The possible therapeutic effect of low-dose ketamine on levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) was noted in a retrospective analysis of Parkinson’s disease patients who received ketamine for pain relief. During this analysis, it was observed that the patients experienced an improvement in LID lasting several weeks beyond treatment [Sherman et al, 2016]. These results were corroborated in a test of low-dose ketamine in a rodent LID model, and this possible effect has also been examined in a controlled study [Bartlett et al, 2016]. Ketamine may also have additional benefits in the treatment of pain [Niesters et al, 2014] and depression [Diamond et al, 2014; Murrough et al, 2013], which are frequent comorbidities of Parkinson’s disease.

Parkinson’s disease is a debilitating disorder that affects over 1 million people in the U.S. and more than 7 million people worldwide. There is currently no cure for Parkinson’s disease, although some drug combinations are used to treat the disease symptoms. The global Parkinson’s disease market is expected to grow from USD $5 billion in 2019 to USD $7.5 billion by the end of 2025 [360iResearch 2020] and it is estimated that the potential market opportunity for LID Parkinson’s disease to be over USD $3 billion in the U.S. alone.

About Parkinson’s Disease

There is currently no cure for Parkinson’s disease. Although the etiology of Parkinson’s disease is not fully understood, it is thought to result from loss of pigmented dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia nigra and their striatal projections, leading to dopamine deficiency in the striatum [Schapira and Jenner, 2011]. This ultimately affects the cortico-striatal system that controls movement. As a progressive neurogenerative disorder of the central nervous system that primarily affects the motor nerve system, symptoms of Parkinson’s disease may emerge slowly and include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability [Paulson and Stern, 2004]. Also, patients may experience non-motor symptoms such as autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, constipation, bladder dysfunction), psychiatric (depression), cognitive and sensory symptoms (pain) [Olanow, et al, 2009]. These non-motor symptoms become more common as the disease progresses. Treatments, including levodopa and dopamine agonists, which restore the dopamine deficits in the brain, have been employed for almost 50 years. However, with continued treatment using levodopa, dose-limiting motor side-effects often emerge. This includes the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements termed Levodopa Induced Dyskinesias, which can be identified in about 50% of patients within five years after initiation of levodopa treatment and in almost all patients within ten years post-treatment initiation. These side effects often limit further dose increases in dopaminergic therapy.

The results demonstrated that DNL343 was generally well tolerated for up to 14 days of dosing, with robust distribution in the central nervous system (CNS) and predictable dose-related increases in DNL343 exposure with a PK profile supporting once daily dosing. Biomarker assessments were also made as related to the cellular integrated stress response (ISR). The ISR is a biological pathway implicated in ALS and other diseases. After healthy volunteers were treated with DNL343, samples of their blood cells were subjected to stress <em>ex vivo</em>, and robust changes in biomarkers of the ISR were observed, confirming pathway engagement.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Denali also presented preclinical data in a mouse model of vanishing white matter (VWM) disease, a genetic and progressive disorder that causes severe neurological symptoms after exposure to certain stressors. eIF2B activity is reduced in the VMW disease model leading to chronic activation of the ISR, making this a relevant model for demonstrating target engagement and ISR modulation by DNL343. After treatment with DNL343, body weight and motor function were normalized in these mice. Furthermore, ISR gene expression and stress response protein levels were reduced in both peripheral tissues as well as the brain. A similar PK/PD relationship was observed in mice and in humans, supporting DNL343 dose selection in the ongoing Phase 1b study in participants with ALS.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The Phase 1b study (<a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mhG9vNnMZVMN-V_9T-72r8v0mi5SXMzls2y7hlNMCWi0Bl4zVvhIhid2Lvdo9vYu7hxkvR7tWhk1vrpCxsmeeukRbLMhBilYorQFx2FRMPR_rBZ5zZQHYrTixTKdBXw3BrPFqwCPoaXqja1tR7vEAw=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT05006352</a>) is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 28-day study followed by an 18-month open-label extension, designed to evaluate the safety, PK and PD of DNL343 in approximately 30 participants with ALS. Dosing in this study began in the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Highlights from RIPK1 inhibitor SAR443820 clinical trial design presentation at NEALS and Fast Track Designation</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Denali’s partner Sanofi presented plans for a Phase 2 study of RIPK1 inhibitor SAR443820 in participants with ALS based on positive results of a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. In that study, robust target engagement was demonstrated at doses that were generally well tolerated. The Phase 2 study, named <strong>HIMALAYA</strong>, is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, followed by an open-label long-term extension, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SAR443820 in adult participants with ALS. This Phase 2 study is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The U.S. FDA has granted Fast Track designation to SAR443820 for the treatment of ALS. Fast Track is an FDA process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Fast Track designation may allow for early and frequent communication with the FDA regarding the development of SAR443820 for the treatment of ALS. This designation also enables rolling review of the marketing application.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the eIF2B activator DNL343</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Modulation of eIF2B activity with DNL343 is a novel and targeted investigational approach with first-in-class potential for the treatment of ALS. eIF2B is an intracellular protein complex that regulates protein synthesis and is required for neuronal health and function. When neurons experience stress, as occurs in ALS, eIF2B activity is suppressed. This leads to impaired protein synthesis and results in the formation of ""stress granules,"" which are thought to be a precursor of TDP-43 aggregation, a hallmark pathology in ALS. DNL343 is designed to activate eIF2B and thereby restore protein synthesis, disperse TDP-43 aggregates, and improve neuronal survival. DNL343 is an investigational therapeutic and has not been approved by any regulatory authority for any commercial use.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the RIPK1 Inhibitor SAR443820/DNL788</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">SAR443820/DNL788 is a novel, CNS-penetrant, small molecule inhibitor of RIPK1, a critical signaling mediator of necroptotic cell death, cytokine release, and inflammatory pathways. Denali and Sanofi entered into a broad collaboration in October 2018 for the global development and commercialization of RIPK1 inhibitors. This includes CNS-penetrant molecules such as SAR443820/DNL788, which was evaluated in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, with potential development for neurological indications such as ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Sanofi leads Phase 1 and Phase 2 development of SAR443820/DNL788 for ALS and MS and leads co-development of SAR443820/DNL788 with Denali in Phase 3 clinical trials for ALS, AD and MS. SAR443820/DNL788 is an investigational therapeutic that has not been approved by any regulatory authority for any commercial use.</p>

The safety profile of deucravacitinib was consistent with previously reported studies in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and no new safety signals were observed.

“Deucravacitinib has been shown to be a highly effective, first-in-class, oral, selective TYK2 inhibitor in psoriasis and we have ongoing Phase 3 trials exploring the potential of deucravacitinib in psoriatic arthritis,” said <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com%2Fabout-us%2Fleadership%2Fleadership-team.html&amp;esheet=52505191&amp;newsitemid=20211007005303&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Samit+Hirawat%2C+M.D.&amp;index=2&amp;md5=f0ced2d0009742094e11bd01520f0776"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Samit Hirawat, M.D.</a>, chief medical officer, Bristol Myers Squibb. “While we did not achieve proof of concept in this study, we are committed to advancing our deucravacitinib clinical program in inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, as well as in psoriatic arthritis, lupus and other immune-mediated diseases. Bristol Myers Squibb would like to thank the patients and investigators who were involved in the LATTICE-UC clinical trial.”

The company will complete a full review of the data from LATTICE-UC and the potential of deucravacitinib in UC continues to be evaluated in IM011-127, a second Phase 2 trial that also includes a higher dose.

Bristol Myers Squibb continues to expect greater than $4 billion non-risk adjusted revenue target for deucravacitinib in 2029.

<b>About Deucravacitinib</b>

Deucravacitinib (pronounced doo-krav-a-sih-ti-nib) is a first-in-class, oral, selective tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor with a unique mechanism of action and is the first and only selective TYK2 inhibitor in clinical studies across multiple immune-mediated diseases. Bristol Myers Squibb scientists designed deucravacitinib to selectively target TYK2, thereby inhibiting signaling of interleukin (IL)-23, IL-12 and Type 1 interferon (IFN), key cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of multiple immune-mediated diseases. Deucravacitinib achieves a high degree of selectivity by binding to the regulatory domain of TYK2, resulting in allosteric inhibition of TYK2 and its downstream functions. Deucravacitinib selectively inhibits TYK2, unlike approved Janus kinase (JAK) 1, 2 and 3 inhibitors, at physiologically relevant concentrations. At therapeutic doses, deucravacitinib does not inhibit JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3. Due to the innovative design of deucravacitinib, Bristol Myers Squibb earned recognition with the 2019 Thomas Alva Edison Patent Award for the science underpinning the clinical development of deucravacitinib.

Deucravacitinib is being studied in multiple immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus and inflammatory bowel disease. Deucravacitinib is not approved for use in any country.

<b>About Ulcerative Colitis</b>

Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is characterized by an irregular, chronic immune response that creates inflammation and ulcers (sores) in the mucosa (lining) of the large intestine (colon) or rectum. Symptoms include bloody stools, severe diarrhea and frequent abdominal pain. Ulcerative colitis has a major impact on patients' health-related quality of life, including physical functioning, social and emotional well-being and ability to go to work/school. Many patients have an inadequate response or do not respond at all to currently available therapies.<sup> </sup>It is estimated that approximately 14.9 million people worldwide are living with IBD.

<b>Bristol Myers Squibb: Pioneering Paths Forward in Immunology to Transform Patients’ Lives</b>

Bristol Myers Squibb is inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. For people living with immune-mediated diseases, the debilitating reality of enduring chronic symptoms and disease progression can take a toll on their physical, emotional and social well-being, making simple tasks and daily life a challenge. Driven by our deep understanding of the immune system that spans over 20 years of experience, and our passion to help patients, the company continues to pursue pathbreaking science with the goal of delivering meaningful solutions that address unmet needs in rheumatology, gastroenterology, dermatology and multiple sclerosis. We follow the science, aiming to tailor therapies to individual needs, improve outcomes and expand treatment options by working to identify mechanisms with the potential to achieve long-term remission – and perhaps even cures – in the future. By building partnerships with researchers, patients and caregivers to deliver innovative treatments, Bristol Myers Squibb strives to elevate patient care to new standards and deliver what matters most – the promise of living a better life.

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this press release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Amgen’s results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen’s products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen’s research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market. Amgen’s business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen’s business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development.

Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen’s products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen’s distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen’s products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen’s efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology Amgen has acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen’s systems and Amgen’s data. Amgen’s stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect Amgen’s business. Amgen’s business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.

Apobiologix, a division of Apotex Inc., expanded its leadership in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada's</span> biosimilar market with the approval of its first therapeutic treatment, Bambevi<sup>®</sup>. The company, a pioneer and leader in oncology biosimilars in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, recently received approval from Health Canada for its first therapeutic product.

Bambevi ( bevacizumab) is used in combination with chemotherapy to treat specific types of colorectal, lung, brain and ovarian cancer. This approval, coupled with well-established Apobiologix supportive care products, further enables Apobiologix to deliver on its mission to transform access to affordable therapies in oncology and beyond.

Apobiologix successfully launched its first product, Grastofil<sup>®</sup>  (filgrastim), in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> in  2016, followed by the launch of Lapelga<sup>®</sup>  in 2019, the first-ever pegfilgrastim biosimilar approved in any highly regulated market. These products encourage the body's production of white blood cells, which helps to fight infection in patients undergoing certain cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation. Apobiologix was the first company to offer a portfolio of G-CSF biosimilars.

""Biosimilars provide an opportunity for the sustainability of global healthcare systems by increasing competition and reducing costs, and most importantly, giving patients increased access to highly effective and often lifesaving biological drugs,""   said <span class=""xn-person"">Mike Woolcock</span>, SVP, Commercial Operations. The availability of Grastofil and Lapelga has saved the healthcare system tens of millions of dollars while expanding utilization for patients in need by tens of thousands at the same time.

Designed to be similar to another already approved biological medicine, biosimilars are approved to the same standards of quality, safety and efficacy that apply to biological medicines.

Alvotech, today announced top-line results from a randomized study in patients that demonstrate bioequivalence of repeated switches between administration of Humira® (adalimumab) and Alvotech’s high-concentration biosimilar candidate, AVT02 (100 mg/mL) to administration of Humira without switching. Further, no significant differences were observed in clinical efficacy, safety or immunogenicity between the switching cohort and the reference product cohort.

The purpose of the switching study is to support the potential approval of AVT02 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an interchangeable product with Humira. Alvotech is the only known company that has both developed and submitted a filing for a high-concentration biosimilar candidate to Humira, as well as conducted a switching study to support potential approval as an interchangeable product. Teva Pharmaceuticals, a US affiliate of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) is the exclusive strategic partner for the commercialization of AVT02 in the United States.

Adalimumab inhibits Tumor Necrosis Factor, which is a protein in the body that causes inflammation. Adalimumab is used to treat certain inflammatory conditions. Humira recorded sales of about US$20 billion in 2018, making it the largest-selling biologic in the world.Today, over 80 percent of the usage of Humira in the United States is the high-concentration strengths.

The clinical trial (AVT02-GL-302; NCT04453137) included 568 patients across approximately 30 centers in Europe. After completing the lead-in period of 12 weeks under treatment with the reference product, eligible patients were randomized into either of the two arms of the switching module: the first group continued treatment with Humira, the second group continued treatment receiving alternating doses of AVT02 and Humira for an additional 16 weeks.

According to the FDA, an interchangeable product may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of a prescriber. The substitution may occur at the pharmacy, much like how generic drugs are substituted for brand name drugs, subject to varying U.S. state pharmacy laws. Biosimilar and interchangeable products have the potential to reduce health care costs, similar to how generic drugs have reduced costs. The concept of interchangeability for biosimilars was signed into law through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) in 2010. In order to be considered interchangeable, a biosimilar must meet additional requirements, including the execution of a “switching study,” utilizing the reference product and biosimilar product in patients. The vast majority of states have passed laws regarding substitution for interchangeable products.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced positive top-line results from Study 2 of the Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 clinical trial in adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), showing upadacitinib (RINVOQ®; 15 mg, once daily) met the primary endpoint of Assessment in SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 40 response and the majority of ranked secondary endpoints at week 14.1 Significantly more upadacitinib-treated patients achieved ASAS40 response at week 14 compared to placebo (45 percent versus 23 percent; p<0.0001).1

SELECT-AXIS 2 is the first trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in adult patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.1 Earlier today, AbbVie announced positive results from Study 1 of SELECT-AXIS 2 in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and inadequate response to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs).1

“People living with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis suffer from chronic inflammatory back pain and limited physical function that can be very debilitating,” said Michael Severino, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. “These patients need treatments that help them improve their physical function and quality of life. We are encouraged by the potential of upadacitinib in helping to provide relief of these signs and symptoms through meaningful disease control.”

Treatment with upadacitinib resulted in reductions in signs and symptoms of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, including back pain and inflammation, as well as improvements in physical function and disease activity at week 14.1 Significantly more patients treated with upadacitinib achieved Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) Low Disease Activity compared to those treated with placebo (42 percent versus 18 percent; p<0.0001).1 A statistically significantly improvement in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) Score (SI Joints) as measured by mean change from baseline was reported in the upadacitinib group versus the placebo group (-2.49 versus 0.57; p<0.0001).1 Patients on upadacitinib experienced significantly greater decrease from baseline in Patient’s Assessment of Total Back Pain at week 14 than those on placebo (-2.91 versus -2.00; p=0.0004).1 Additionally, patients treated with upadacitinib experienced significantly greater improvement in physical function as assessed by mean change from baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) compared to patients on placebo (-2.61 versus -1.47; p<0.0001).1

*Primary and ranked secondary endpoints at week 14. Not all ranked secondary endpoints are shown. All endpoints shown with the exception of total back pain (p=0.0004) achieved p-values of <0.0001 versus placebo.

a ASAS 40 is defined as a =40 percent improvement and an absolute improvement of =2 units (on a scale of 0 to 10) from Baseline in at least 3 of the 4 domains (patient’s global assessment, back pain, function and inflammation) with no worsening at all in the remaining domain.

b ASDAS Low Disease Activity is defined as ASDAS score <2.1.

c SPARCC scores for SI-Joints are calculated by adding up the dichotomous outcomes from evaluations of the presence, depth, and intensity of bone marrow edema lesions of the SI-joints.

d Back Pain is measured using 0 – 10 numerical rating scale (NRS) for Total Back Pain (0 = no pain and 10 = severe pain).

e BASFI is a validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument for use in the axial SpA patient population. It consists of 10 items measured on a 0 to 10 NRS, which assesses the ability to perform activities known to be problematic to axial SpA patients such as dressing, bending, reaching, turning, and climbing steps. The total scores range from 0 to 10.

“Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis affects a younger adult patient population which can have a significant impact during prime years of those dealing with the disease,” said Atul Deodhar, M.D., professor of medicine and medical director of the Rheumatology Clinics for the Division of Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases at Oregon Health & Science University. “These data show that upadacitinib has the potential to improve non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis symptoms and help patients take control of their disease.”

Safety data were consistent with SELECT-AXIS 1, previous Phase 3 studies in other indications, and the known safety profile of upadacitinib, with no new risks identified.1-6 Through week 14, the most common adverse events (= 3 percent of patients) with upadacitinib were headache, COVID-19, nasopharyngitis and nausea.1 The proportion of patients with adverse events leading to discontinuation, serious adverse events and serious infections were 2.6 percent/2.6 percent/1.3 percent for upadacitinib and 1.3 percent/1.3 percent/0.6 percent for placebo, respectively.1 Serious infections included COVID-19 induced pneumonia and pyelonephritis in two patients on upadacitinib and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in one patient on placebo.1 Two patients treated with upadacitinib and one treated with placebo developed non-serious, mild or moderate herpes zoster limited to one dermatome.1 One patient treated with placebo developed a malignancy (basal cell carcinoma).1 No adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolic events or deaths were reported in either group through week 14.1

Full results from the SELECT-AXIS 2 trial will be presented at a future medical meeting and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Use of upadacitinib in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis is not approved, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by regulatory authorities.

About SELECT-AXIS 2 – Study 21,8
SELECT-AXIS 2 was conducted as a master study protocol that contains two standalone studies with randomization, data collection, analysis and reporting conducted independently. The Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies are evaluating the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib compared with placebo on reduction of signs and symptoms in adult participants with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) including biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug inadequate responders (bDMARD-IR) ankylosing spondylitis (Study 1) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (Study 2). Study 2 enrolled 314 participants who were randomized to receive upadacitinib for 104 weeks or placebo for 52 weeks followed by upadacitinib for 52 weeks. More information on this trial can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04169373).

About Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) 
Axial spondyloarthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the spine, causing back pain, limited mobility, and structural damage.15 It consists of two subsets that have been clinically defined as ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA).15 In ankylosing spondylitis, patients have definitive structural damage of the sacroiliac joints visible on x-rays.15 Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis is clinically defined by the absence of definitive x-ray evidence of structural damage to the sacroiliac (SI) joint by plain x-ray.15

About upadacitinib (RINVOQ®)
Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.1-14 In human cellular assays, RINVOQ preferentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2.5 RINVOQ is approved by the European Commission for adults (15 mg and 30 mg) and adolescents (15 mg) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. RINVOQ 15 mg is approved by the European Commission for adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, adults with active psoriatic arthritis and adults with active ankylosing spondylitis. RINVOQ 15 mg is also approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis are ongoing.7-14

EU Indications and Important Safety Information About RINVOQ® (upadacitinib)5

Rheumatoid arthritis
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.

Psoriatic arthritis
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs. RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.

Ankylosing spondylitis
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy.

Atopic dermatitis
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.

Contraindications    
RINVOQ is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients, in patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections, in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and during pregnancy.

Special warnings and precautions for use
Immunosuppressive medicinal products
Use in combination with other potent immunosuppressants is not recommended.

Serious infections
Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving upadacitinib. The most frequent serious infections reported included pneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of bacterial meningitis have been reported. Among opportunistic infections, TB, multi-dermatomal herpes zoster, oral/esophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis have been reported with upadacitinib. As there is a higher incidence of infections in patients =65 years of age, caution should be used when treating this population.

Viral reactivation
Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes zoster, was reported in clinical studies. The risk of herpes zoster appears to be higher in Japanese patients treated with upadacitinib.

Vaccinations
The use of live, attenuated vaccines during or immediately prior to therapy is not recommended. It is recommended that patients be brought up to date with all immunizations, including prophylactic zoster vaccinations, prior to initiating upadacitinib, in agreement with current immunization guidelines.

Malignancy
The risk of malignancies, including lymphoma is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Malignancies, including nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), have been reported in patients treated with upadacitinib. Consider the risks and benefits of upadacitinib treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated NMSC or when considering continuing upadacitinib therapy in patients who develop a malignancy.

Hematological abnormalities
Treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients with hematological abnormalities observed during routine patient management.

Cardiovascular risk
RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients treated with upadacitinib should have risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.

Lipids
Upadacitinib treatment was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Hepatic transaminase elevations
Treatment with upadacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo

Venous thromboembolisms
Events of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, including upadacitinib. Upadacitinib should be used with caution in patients at high risk for DVT/PE.

Adverse reactions
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis clinical trials (=2% of patients in at least one of the indications) with upadacitinib 15 mg were upper respiratory tract infections, blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, alanine transaminase (ALT) increased, bronchitis, nausea, cough, aspartate transaminase (AST) increased, and hypercholesterolemia.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions in atopic dermatitis trials (=2% of patients) with upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg were upper respiratory tract infection, acne, herpes simplex, headache, CPK increased, cough, folliculitis, abdominal pain, nausea, neutropenia, pyrexia, and influenza.

The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections.

The safety profile of upadacitinib with long term treatment was generally similar to the safety profile during the placebo-controlled period across indications.

Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis or active ankylosing spondylitis treated with upadacitinib 15 mg was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients with RA.

In atopic dermatitis, dose-dependent increased risks of infection and herpes zoster were observed with upadacitinib. Based on limited data, there was a higher rate of overall adverse reactions with the upadacitinib 30 mg dose compared to the 15 mg dose in patients aged 65 years and older. The safety profile for upadacitinib 15 mg in adolescents was similar to that in adults. The safety and efficacy of the 30 mg dose in adolescents are still being investigated. Dose-dependent changes in ALT increased and/or AST increased (= 3 x ULN), lipid parameters, CPK values (> 5 x ULN), and neutropenia (ANC < 1 x 109 cells/L) associated with upadacitinib treatment were similar to what was observed in the rheumatologic disease clinical studies.

The collaboration brings together the translational research and drug development expertise of MD Anderson’s Therapeutics Discovery division with Schrödinger’s expertise and drug development program for WEE1 inhibitors. The goal of the collaboration is to accelerate and optimize the clinical development path for Schrödinger’s WEE1 program through molecular biomarker-driven tumor type prioritization and patient stratification and to validate biomarkers to predict response or resistance to a WEE1 inhibitor. The joint team will seek to prioritize clinical studies of a WEE1 inhibitor as a single agent in selected cancer indications and in rational combinations for defined clinical subpopulations.

“We are excited to work with MD Anderson’s researchers to speed the development of our WEE1 program and potentially advance a new therapeutic option for patients,” said Karen Akinsanya, Ph.D., executive vice president, chief biomedical scientist and head of discovery research and development at Schrödinger. “We have identified multiple highly selective WEE1 inhibitors with desirable drug-like properties that show strong pharmacodynamic responses and anti-tumor activity in preclinical models. We believe this profile may position our compounds as ideal candidates for applications both as monotherapy and as combination therapy partners.”

Under the preclinical collaboration agreement, Schrödinger will join forces with researchers in MD Anderson's <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdanderson.org%2Fcancermoonshots%2Fresearch_platforms%2Ftraction.html&amp;esheet=52504954&amp;newsitemid=20211007005230&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Translational+Research+to+AdvanCe+Therapeutics+and+Innovation+in+ONcology+%28TRACTION%29+platform&amp;index=3&amp;md5=a3205f12a9a4ea2e1f25a0c3ef4ff801"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Translational Research to AdvanCe Therapeutics and Innovation in ONcology (TRACTION) platform</a>, which leads cutting-edge translational biology research to rapidly position new therapies for clinical trials. TRACTION is a core component of MD Anderson’s Therapeutics Discovery division, an integrated team of clinicians, researchers and drug development experts working to advance impactful therapies that address patient needs.

“Targeting WEE1, a critical gatekeeper of the cell cycle, is showing promise as a therapeutic strategy for treating certain cancers with select genetic alterations,” said<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdanderson.org%2Fcancermoonshots%2Fabout%2Four-physicians-researchers%2Ft-heffernan.html&amp;esheet=52504954&amp;newsitemid=20211007005230&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Timothy+Heffernan%2C+Ph.D.&amp;index=4&amp;md5=7402a5b822e9b2d82c8c003af0a3f4f7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> Timothy Heffernan, Ph.D.</a>, executive director of TRACTION. “Through our collaboration with Schrödinger, we aim to identify clinically relevant patient populations that may benefit from WEE1 inhibition and to advance innovative targeted therapies that can improve their lives.”

MD Anderson and Schrödinger will jointly pursue translational studies, and Schrödinger will provide research support funding. As part of the agreement, MD Anderson is eligible to receive certain payments based on the future development and commercialization of Schrödinger’s WEE1 inhibitor compounds. Schrödinger will have sole responsibility for the development, manufacture and commercialization of all compounds and products, and sole rights to all novel intellectual property that arises from this collaboration.

WEE1 is a gatekeeper checkpoint kinase that prevents progression through the cell cycle, allowing time for DNA repair to occur before cell division takes place. Thus, inhibition of WEE1 allows for accumulation of DNA damage, triggering DNA breakage and apoptosis in tumor cells. Schrödinger is developing tight-binding, selective WEE1 inhibitors with optimized physicochemical properties designed to be well suited for combinations with other DNA damage response therapies for the treatment of a broad range of solid tumors.

Allogene Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic CAR T (AlloCAR T™) therapies for cancer, today reported that following a report of a chromosomal abnormality in ALLO-501A CAR T cells in a patient treated in the ALPHA2 study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has placed a hold on the Company’s AlloCAR T clinical trials.

The Company expects to provide additional updates in the coming weeks following consultation with the FDA. The FDA continues to actively review the end of Phase 1 materials submitted in anticipation for an ALLO-501A pivotal Phase 2 trial.

“Patient safety is our highest priority, and we are committed to working closely with the FDA to evaluate any potential clinical implications of this finding, and determine next steps for advancing ALLO-501A and our clinical programs,” said Rafael Amado, M.D., Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer. “As a leading developer of allogeneic cell therapies, we recognize our added responsibility to fully assess all aspects of our therapies to advance the field. We are grateful for the partnership with the patient community, clinical investigators, our Scientific Advisory Board, and the FDA as we work diligently toward understanding the clinical significance of this finding and to support the development of allogeneic CAR T therapy for cancer.”

The clinical hold follows the Company’s notification to the FDA of a chromosomal abnormality in an ALPHA2 study patient which was detected in a bone marrow biopsy undertaken to assess pancytopenia (low blood counts). An investigation is underway to further characterize the observed abnormality, including any clinical relevance, evidence of clonal expansion, or potential relationship to gene editing.

The single case involves a patient with Stage IV transformed follicular lymphoma and c-myc rearrangement whose cancer was refractory to two prior lines of immune-chemotherapy and additional radiation therapy. The patient could not receive an autologous CD19 CAR T cell therapy due to manufacturing failure associated with inadequate expansion of autologous CAR T cells.

Following infusion of ALLO-501A, the patient experienced Grade 1 CRS and Grade 2 ICANS, which required a course of high dose steroid therapy. The patient subsequently developed progressive pancytopenia and a bone marrow biopsy showed aplastic anemia and the presence of ALLO-501A CAR T cells with the chromosomal abnormality. Early translational data showed that the CAR T cells expanded, peaking on Day 28, and undergoing contraction thereafter. The patient had a partial response to ALLO-501A and subsequently underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Prolonged cytopenia requiring rescue stem cell transplantation has been reported in autologous CAR T therapies.

Allogene has dosed more than 100 patients with its gene edited AlloCAR T products. The Company believes the data generated from the ALPHA trials support a favorable clinical profile for ALLO-501A in patients with large B cell lymphoma.

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (<a href=""https://www.takeda.com/investors/"">TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK</a>) (“Takeda”) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (AMDAC) voted unanimously to recommend use of maribavir (TAK-620) for the treatment of refractory cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease with genotypic resistance to ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir in transplant recipients. The committee also voted unanimously to recommend use of maribavir for the treatment of refractory CMV infection and disease without genotypic resistance to ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir in transplant recipients. Both recommendations were based on the results of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 TAK-620-303 (SOLSTICE) trials.

“Today’s vote in favor of our investigational antiviral drug marks a significant step towards delivering the first approved treatment for adult transplant recipients with refractory CMV infection and disease, with or without resistance,” said Obi Umeh, MD, Vice President and Maribavir Global Program Leader at Takeda. “We look forward to working with the FDA as it completes its review of our application.”

AMDAC also heard from patients, advocates, and healthcare providers in the public forum discussion who underscored the need for new treatment options for this patient population.

The New Drug Application (NDA) for maribavir is currently under Priority Review by the FDA. The FDA will consider the vote as part of its review of the NDA and is not bound by the AMDAC’s recommendation. The NDA submission is based on the pivotal Phase 3 TAK-620-303 (SOLSTICE) trial.

“The treatment of CMV in patients who have undergone a solid organ or stem cell transplant is complicated, especially in patients who have failed standard treatment and who may be at risk for side effects from currently available medications,” said Dr. Emily Blumberg, Director, Transplant Infectious Diseases, Penn Medicine. ""I am excited about the potential for an additional treatment option for post-transplant patients with CMV.”
<h5>About CMV</h5>
CMV is a beta herpesvirus that commonly infects humans; serologic evidence of prior infection can be found in 40%-100% of various adult populations.<sup>1</sup> CMV typically resides latent and asymptomatic in the body but may reactivate during periods of immunosuppression. Serious disease may occur in individuals with compromised immune systems, which includes patients who receive immunosuppressants associated with various types of transplants, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT).<sup>2,3</sup> Out of the estimated 200,000 adult transplants per year globally, CMV is one of the most common viral infections experienced by transplant recipients, with an estimated incidence rate between 16-56% in SOT recipients and 30-70% in HSCT recipients.<sup>3–10</sup>

In transplant recipients, reactivation of CMV can lead to serious consequences, including loss of the transplanted organ and, in extreme cases, can be fatal.<sup>11,12</sup> Existing therapies to treat post-transplant CMV infections may demonstrate toxicities that require dose adjustments or may fail to adequately suppress viral replication<strong>.</strong><sup>11–13</sup> Additionally, existing therapies may require or prolong hospitalization due to administration.<sup>11,12</sup>
<h5>About maribavir</h5>
Maribavir, an orally bioavailable anti-CMV compound, is the only antiviral agent presently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of adult post-transplant patients with CMV in SOT or HSCT. Maribavir is an investigational treatment that has not been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), or any other regulatory authorities. Maribavir is the only CMV antiviral drug that targets and inhibits the UL97 protein kinase and its natural substrates.<sup>14–17</sup>

Maribavir has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the European Commission as a treatment of CMV disease in patients with impaired cell mediated immunity and by the FDA for treatment of clinically significant CMV viremia and disease in at-risk patients. Orphan status is granted to certain investigational medicines intended for the treatment or prevention of a rare, life-threatening disease. The FDA has also granted maribavir Breakthrough Therapy Designation as a treatment for CMV infection and disease in transplant patients resistant or refractory to prior therapy. Breakthrough Therapy Designation expedites the development and review of investigational treatments for serious conditions with preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. Most recently, the FDA has granted priority review of maribavir for the treatment of adult post-transplant recipients with CMV infection in those resistant and/or refractory to prior anti-CMV treatment. These designations and NDA acceptance do not guarantee that the EMA or FDA will approve maribavir for the treatment of CMV infections in adult transplant patients, and the timing of any such approval is uncertain.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by intense uncontrolled itching, dry skin, which becomes cracked, hardened, oozing and painful.  It is estimated that up to 17% of Canadians will suffer from AD at some points in their lives.<sup>2</sup>

</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

""Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that impacts both patients and caregivers. As atopic dermatitis is common at all ages, it affects many Canadians. I have seen first-hand the debilitating impact of atopic dermatitis on patients through my research and my practice,"" states Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Kim Alexander Papp</span>, MD, PhD, FRCPC, Probity Medical Research and K. Papp Clinical Research, Waterloo ON. ""If we hope to improve patients' overall quality of life, clinicians need more tools.  Having access to advanced therapies allows us to better support patients and provide them with treatment outcomes that address their unmet needs.""

The Health Canada authorization is supported by data from a large registrational Phase 3 clinical trial program in atopic dermatitis including more than 2,500 adults and adolescents with moderate to severe disease.<sup>1</sup> These multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled registrational clinical trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of RINVOQ monotherapy (Measure Up 1 [MU1] and Measure Up 2 [MU2]) and with topical corticosteroids (AD Up [AU]) compared to placebo.<sup>1 3 4</sup> In all three studies, the co-primary endpoints were at least a 75 percent improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) and validated Investigator's Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 0/1 (clear or almost clear) at week 16.<sup> 1 3 4</sup>

Eczema Society of <span class=""xn-location"">Canada's</span> Executive Director <span class=""xn-person"">Amanda Cresswell-Melville</span> highlights the burden of atopic dermatitis. ""The impacts of atopic dermatitis on quality of life for both patients and caregivers are often underestimated and misunderstood,"" says Cresswell-Melville. ""Patients may be seeking additional options to address their unmet needs in the management of their condition.  New treatment options bring hope to these patients.""

Chronic inflammatory skin diseases go well beyond the surface and affect both physical and mental health. The exact cause of atopic dermatitis is unknown, but a combination of immune, genetic, and environmental factors is believed to be involved.<sup>3</sup>

""AbbVie is dedicated to the pursuit of innovation in life sciences and advancing the standards of care for patients,"" says <span class=""xn-person"">Tracey Ramsay</span>, Vice President and General Manager, AbbVie Canada.  ""We are proud of our strong heritage in dermatology and continue to deepen our understanding of the complex nature of serious inflammatory skin conditions. Through this milestone in atopic dermatitis, we remain committed to developing and delivering leading-edge therapies for patients who need them most.""

<b>About RINVOQ® (upadacitinib)</b>

RINVOQ is a once-daily oral medication in an extended-release tablet. It is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that interferes with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is thought to play a role in inflammatory response.

<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking expanded approval of STELARA<sup>®</sup> (ustekinumab) to treat pediatric patients ages 5 years and older with juvenile psoriatic arthritis (jPsA).

The filing is supported by extrapolation of data from nine studies across both adult trials in active PsA and adult and pediatric studies in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, totaling 3,997 patients evaluated across these closely associated diseases. Data extrapolation is the process of estimating response, trends or effects based on previous observations from patients with closely related conditions. With the limited availability of pediatric patients for clinical trial inclusion, researchers can extrapolate data from trials with adults to determine the potential efficacy and tolerability of a treatment for a pediatric population. A decision from the U.S. FDA is anticipated in late 2022.

""As children and their families manage the debilitating symptoms of juvenile psoriatic arthritis, it is critical that their physicians have a breadth of treatment options to consider,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Alyssa Johnsen</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Rheumatology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""With this latest submission, we're excited to work with the U.S. FDA to evaluate this potential therapeutic option that could help meet the needs of children living with psoriatic arthritis.""

STELARA is the first and only biologic targeting both cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, both of which play an important role in inflammation associated with immune-mediated diseases like PsA. Since receiving approval in <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2009</span> for the treatment of adults living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, STELARA has received approval for four additional indications: children (ages 6 and older) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, adults with active PsA, adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

Juvenile arthritis occurs in an estimated 20 to 45 children per 100,000 children in the U.S., with approximately 5 percent of those children having jPsA.<sup>1</sup> jPsA is characterized by both joint inflammation and psoriatic skin lesions that resemble adult PsA.<sup>2</sup> PsA can be a challenging disease to treat especially in younger populations, reinforcing the need for additional treatment options.

""We're pleased to add data for pediatric patients with juvenile psoriatic arthritis to the current body of evidence for STELARA,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Andrew Greenspan</span>, M.D., Vice President, Immunology Medical Affairs, Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC. ""This submission reinforces our commitment to these patients and we are pleased to be taking these positive steps that could make this treatment option available.""

<b><u>About STELARA<sup>® </sup></u></b><b><u>(</u></b><b><u>ustekinumab</u></b><b><u>)<br class=""dnr"" /></u></b>STELARA (ustekinumab), a human IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist, is approved in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> for the treatment of: 1) adults and children 6 years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy; 2) adult patients (18 years or older) with active PsA, used alone or in combination with methotrexate; 3) adult patients (18 years and older) with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease; 4) adult patients (18 years and older) with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION<br class=""dnr"" /></b>STELARA<sup>®</sup> is a prescription medicine that affects your immune system. STELARA<sup>®</sup> can increase your chance of having serious side effects including:

<b>Serious Infections<br class=""dnr"" /></b>STELARA<sup>®</sup> may lower your ability to fight infections and may increase your risk of infections. While taking STELARA<sup>®</sup>, some people have serious infections, which may require hospitalization, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses.
<ul>
 	<li>Your doctor should check you for TB before starting STELARA<sup>®</sup> and watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with STELARA<sup>®</sup>.</li>
 	<li>If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated for TB before and during treatment with STELARA<sup>®</sup>.</li>
</ul>
You should not start taking STELARA<sup>®</sup> if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay.

<b>Before starting STELARA<sup>®</sup>, tell your doctor if you:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as:
<ul>
 	<li>fever, sweats, or chills</li>
 	<li>muscle aches</li>
 	<li>cough</li>
 	<li>shortness of breath</li>
 	<li>blood in phlegm</li>
 	<li>weight loss</li>
 	<li>warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body</li>
 	<li>diarrhea or stomach pain</li>
 	<li>burning when you urinate or urinate more often than normal</li>
 	<li>feel very tired</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>are being treated for an infection.</li>
 	<li>get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back.</li>
 	<li>have TB or have been in close contact with someone with TB.</li>
</ul>
<b>After starting STELARA<sup>®</sup>, call your doctor right away </b>if you have any symptoms of an infection (see above). These may be signs of infections such as chest infections, or skin infections or shingles that could have serious complications. STELARA® can make you more likely to get infections or make an infection that you have worse. People who have a genetic problem where the body does not make any of the proteins interleukin 12 (IL-12) and interleukin 23 (IL-23) are at a higher risk for certain serious infections that can spread throughout the body and cause death. People who take STELARA® may also be more likely to get these infections.

<b>Cancers<br class=""dnr"" /></b>STELARA<sup>®</sup> may decrease the activity of your immune system and increase your risk for certain types of cancer. Tell your doctor if you have ever had any type of cancer. Some people who had risk factors for skin cancer developed certain types of skin cancers while receiving STELARA<sup>®</sup>. Tell your doctor if you have any new skin growths.

<b>Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES</b><b>)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>PRES is a rare condition that affects the brain and can cause death. The cause of PRES is not known. If PRES is found early and treated, most people recover. Tell your doctor right away if you have any new or worsening medical problems including: headache, seizures, confusion, and vision problems.

<b>Serious Allergic Reactions<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Serious allergic reactions can occur. Stop using STELARA<sup>®</sup> and get medical help right away if you have any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction such as: feeling faint, swelling of your face, eyelids, tongue, or throat, chest tightness, or skin rash.

<b>Lung Inflammation<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Cases of lung inflammation have happened in some people who receive STELARA<sup>®</sup> and may be serious. These lung problems may need to be treated in a hospital. Tell your doctor right away if you develop shortness of breath or a cough that doesn't go away during treatment with STELARA<sup>®</sup><b>.</b>

<b>Before receiving STELARA<sup>®</sup>, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>have any of the conditions or symptoms listed above for serious infections, cancers, or PRES.</li>
 	<li>ever had an allergic reaction to STELARA<sup>®</sup> or any of its ingredients. Ask your doctor if you are not sure.</li>
 	<li>are allergic to latex. The needle cover on the prefilled syringe contains latex.</li>
 	<li>have recently received or are scheduled to receive an immunization (vaccine). People who take STELARA<sup>®</sup> should not receive live vaccines. Tell your doctor if anyone in your house needs a live vaccine. The viruses used in some types of live vaccines can spread to people with a weakened immune system, and can cause serious problems. <b>You should not receive the BCG vaccine during the one year before receiving STELARA<sup>®</sup> or one year after you stop receiving STELARA<sup>®</sup>.</b></li>
 	<li>have any new or changing lesions within psoriasis areas or on normal skin.</li>
 	<li>are receiving or have received allergy shots, especially for serious allergic reactions.</li>
 	<li>receive or have received phototherapy for your psoriasis.</li>
 	<li>are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if STELARA<sup>®</sup> can harm your unborn baby. You and your doctor should decide if you will receive STELARA<sup>®</sup>.</li>
 	<li>are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is thought that STELARA<sup>®</sup> passes into your breast milk.</li>
 	<li>talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you receive STELARA<sup>®</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<b>Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take</b>, including prescription and over–the–counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

<b>When prescribed STELARA<sup>®</sup>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Use STELARA<sup>®</sup> exactly as your doctor tells you to.</li>
 	<li>STELARA<sup>®</sup> is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of your doctor. In children 6 years and older, it is recommended that STELARA<sup>®</sup> be administered by a healthcare provider. If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver may give your injections of STELARA<sup>®</sup> at home, you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject STELARA<sup>®</sup>. Your doctor will determine the right dose of STELARA<sup>®</sup> for you, the amount for each injection, and how often you should receive it. Do not try to inject STELARA<sup>®</sup> yourself until you or your caregiver have been shown how to inject STELARA<sup>®</sup> by your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>
<b>Common side effects of STELARA<sup>®</sup> include:</b><b> </b>nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose, upper respiratory infections, fever, headache, tiredness, itching, nausea and vomiting, redness at the injection site, vaginal yeast infections, urinary tract infections, sinus infection, bronchitis, diarrhea, stomach pain, and joint pain. These are not all of the possible side effects with STELARA®. Tell your doctor about any side effect that you experience. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that gantenerumab, an anti-amyloid beta antibody developed for subcutaneous administration, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of people living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This designation is based on data showing that gantenerumab significantly reduced brain amyloid plaque, a pathological hallmark of AD, in the ongoing SCarlet RoAD and Marguerite RoAD open-label extension trials, as well as other studies. Learnings from these studies have been incorporated into the optimized design of two ongoing parallel, global, placebo-controlled and randomized Phase III trials, GRADUATE 1 and 2. The pivotal trials are evaluating gantenerumab in more than 2,000 participants for more than two years and are expected to be completed in the second half of 2022.

“For more than a decade, we’ve been committed to advancing the science of Alzheimer’s as well as our investigational medicine gantenerumab, and we look forward to delivering a comprehensive and robust data set that furthers our collective understanding of this devastating disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “This Breakthrough Therapy Designation reinforces our confidence in gantenerumab, which would be the first subcutaneous medicine for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease with the potential for at-home administration.”

Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to accelerate the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions with preliminary evidence that indicates they may demonstrate a substantial improvement over available therapies that have received full FDA approval. This designation for gantenerumab marks the 39th Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Genentech’s portfolio of medicines.

AD is a progressive, fatal disease of the brain characterized by a decline in memory, language, and other thinking skills as well as changes in mood and behavior. Biological changes in the brain are believed to start decades before clinical symptoms of AD become evident. Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, which currently affects more than 55 million people worldwide, and is projected to reach 78 million by 2030. An enormous and growing public health challenge, it is predicted to cost the global economy a cumulative $20 trillion over the next decade, or the U.S. $2.8 trillion per year by 2030. Approximately 10 million people are diagnosed with AD each year. Given the medical and societal complexities of AD, several tools and treatment options will likely be required to meet the multiple and diverse needs of people living with the disease.

Genentech is continuing to explore multiple approaches and molecules that may address key pathways of AD, including amyloid beta and tau, as well as innovative tools designed to more effectively diagnose AD and support clinicians in monitoring disease progression.

<strong>About gantenerumab and its clinical program</strong>
Gantenerumab is an investigational IgG1 antibody designed to bind to aggregated forms of amyloid beta and remove brain amyloid plaques, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Gantenerumab significantly lowered brain amyloid plaques in patients with sporadic AD in the SCarlet RoAD and Marguerite RoAD open-label extension studies (OLEs) and in patients with dominantly inherited AD in the DIAN-TU-001 study. Learnings from these studies have been incorporated into the optimized design of two ongoing parallel, global, placebo-controlled and randomized Phase III trials, GRADUATE 1 and 2.

The pivotal GRADUATE trials are investigating the effect of gantenerumab on amyloid load and downstream biomarkers of disease progression, as well as the safety and efficacy of gantenerumab in people with early (prodromal-to-mild) AD. The studies include more than 2,000 participants treated for more than two years in up to 350 study centers in more than 30 countries worldwide. It is evaluating a monthly target dose of 1,020 mg with an optimized titration, aimed at maximizing exposure and minimizing dose interruption throughout the study period for better detection of a potential clinical benefit. Data from both trials are expected in the second half of 2022.

Other studies evaluating gantenerumab in AD include:
<ul>
 	<li>Open RoAD, a rollover open-label study for the former SCarlet RoAD and Marguerite RoAD OLEs to continue to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term administration of gantenerumab in participants with AD.</li>
 	<li>GRADUATION, an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of once weekly administration of gantenerumab in participants with early AD. The study design is similar to the GRADUATE studies and includes the option of home administration by a caregiver.</li>
 	<li>An exploratory OLE of DIAN-TU-001, aiming to build on learnings from DIAN-TU-001 and further investigate the relationship of biomarker changes with cognitive and clinical findings in participants with autosomal dominant AD (ADAD).</li>
</ul>

Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TPTX), a precision oncology company developing next-generation therapies that target genetic drivers of cancer, today announced the presentation of early clinical data from the <em>NTRK</em>-positive TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated advanced solid tumor cohorts (EXP-5 and EXP-6) of the ongoing TRIDENT-1 Phase 1/2 study of its lead drug candidate repotrectinib.

These data are being presented today at a plenary session at the Virtual International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics hosted by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) being held October 7-10.

“These data in patients with <em>NTRK</em>-positive advanced solid tumors are encouraging and support further investigation of repotrectinib in this patient population, especially in the TKI-pretreated setting where there are no currently approved targeted therapies,” said Mohammad Hirmand, M.D., chief medical officer. “Based on these findings and repotrectinib having recently been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for <em>NTRK</em>-positive TKI-pretreated advanced solid tumors, we look forward to discussing next steps toward potential registration of repotrectinib in this patient population at a Type B meeting with the FDA anticipated in the first half of 2022.”

<strong>Repotrectinib Early Data from Phase 1/2 TRIDENT-1 Study from </strong><strong><em>NTRK</em></strong><strong>-Positive Advanced Solid Tumor Cohorts (EXP-5, EXP-6)</strong>
The early Phase 2 TRIDENT-1 dataset utilizes an August 26, 2021 data cutoff. The safety analysis includes 301 treated patients from the pooled Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of TRIDENT-1 across all cohorts, and the preliminary efficacy analysis includes 40 evaluable patients from the pooled Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of TRIDENT-1 in the <em>NTRK</em>-positive advanced solid tumor cohorts (EXP-5, EXP-6). Of the 40 patients, 17 were TKI-naïve and 23 were TKI-pretreated. Phase 2 patients included in the efficacy analysis had baseline measurable disease and at least one post-baseline evaluable scan or were off treatment prior to first post-baseline scan. Responses were confirmed with a subsequent scan at least 28 days later per RECIST 1.1 and were determined by physician assessment for Phase 2 patients. Phase 1 patients included in the efficacy analysis were treated at or above the Phase 2 dose, with responses assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). The Phase 1 data cutoff date was July 22, 2019 for responses and August 26, 2021 for duration of treatment.

The findings were reported in a pre-recorded oral plenary presentation by Benjamin Besse, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Medical Oncology at Paris-Saclay University and full-time cancer specialist at Gustave Roussy Cancer Center available on October 8 at 10:05 a.m. ET on the meeting website.

Pooled Phase 1 and Phase 2 Preliminary Efficacy Analysis (n=40)
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>In the <em>NTRK</em>-positive TKI-naïve advanced solid tumor population (EXP-5: n=17), the confirmed Objective Response Rate (cORR) was 41% (95% CI: 18-67). At the time of the data cutoff, three patients with limited time on treatment achieved stable disease with tumor regression of -21%, -23%, and -27% on their first post-baseline scans, and were awaiting their next scans. Duration of response ranged from 1.9+ to 7.4+ months, and the duration of treatment in the 17 patients ranged from 0.9 to 30.7+ months.</li>
 	<li>In the <em>NTRK</em>-positive TKI-pretreated advanced solid tumor population (EXP-6: n=23), the cORR was 48% (95% CI: 27-69). As of the cutoff date, three patients had unconfirmed partial responses (uPRs). Two uPRs have been confirmed since the cutoff date and are included in the cORR; the third patient with a uPR was on treatment awaiting a confirmatory scan and is not considered a responder in the cORR. The 48% cORR is an update since the pre-recorded presentation. Duration of response ranged from 0.9+ to 15.1 months, and the duration of treatment in the 23 patients ranged from 0.6 to 20.8 months.</li>
 	<li>Of the 23 <em>NTRK</em>-positive TKI-pretreated advanced solid tumor patients, 13 (57%) had NTRK solvent front mutations. In these 13 patients, the cORR was 62% (95% CI: 32-86) including one patient who had a complete response. As of the cutoff date, three patients had unconfirmed partial responses (uPRs). Two uPRs have been confirmed since the cutoff date and are included in the cORR; the third patient with a uPR was on treatment awaiting a confirmatory scan and is not considered a responder in the cORR. The 62% cORR is an update since the pre-recorded presentation. Duration of response ranged from 0.9+ to 13.7 months.</li>
</ul>
Preliminary Safety Analysis (n=301)
<ul>
 	<li>Repotrectinib was generally well tolerated.</li>
 	<li>The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was low-grade dizziness (60%) of which 76% of reported cases were grade 1. Eleven patients (4%) reported ataxia in the absence of dizziness. No events of dizziness or ataxia led to treatment discontinuation.</li>
 	<li>Dose modifications due to TEAEs included 27% of patients who had dose reduction and 11% who had drug discontinuation.</li>
</ul>
Turning Point also announced the publication of preclinical data of repotrectinib in the American Association of Cancer Research’s peer reviewed journal, <em>Molecular Cancer Therapeutics</em>. Preclinical studies described in the publication titled “Molecular Characteristics of Repotrectinib That Enable Potent Inhibition of TRK Fusion Proteins and Resistant Mutations” show that repotrectinib potently inhibited TRK fusion proteins and resistance mutations. Repotrectinib was the most potent inhibitor of wild-type TRKA/B/C fusions and was more potent than selitrectinib against all tested resistance mutations.

Repotrectinib was recently granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion who have progressed following treatment with one or two prior TRK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, with or without prior chemotherapy, and have no satisfactory alternative treatments. The company is planning to discuss next steps towards potential registration of repotrectinib in this patient population at a Type B meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) anticipated in the first half of 2022.

REGENXBIO Inc. (Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regenxbio-presents-positive-initial-data-from-phase-ii-altitude-trial-of-rgx-314-for-the-treatment-of-diabetic-retinopathy-using-suprachoroidal-delivery-at-american-society-of-retina-specialists-annual-meeting-301396478.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">RGNX</a>) today announced initial data from the ongoing Phase II ALTITUDE™ trial of RGX-314 for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) without center-involved diabetic macular edema (CI-DME) using in-office suprachoroidal delivery. The data is being presented at the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) Annual Meeting by <span class=""xn-person"">Dennis Marcus</span>, M.D., F.A.S.R.S., President, Southeast Retina Center. RGX-314 is a potential one-time gene therapy in clinical development for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration and DR.

""We are pleased to share initial data from the Phase II ALTITUDE trial, and we are encouraged to see treatment effect particularly at this early time point of three months after the one-time, in-office administration of RGX-314,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Steve Pakola</span>, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of REGENXBIO. ""RGX-314 is the first gene therapy in clinical trials for DR using suprachoroidal delivery, and has the potential to provide sustainable, long-term anti-VEGF protein production in the eye for the treatment of DR, which affects approximately eight million people in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> alone. We look forward to providing additional updates on this trial next year.""

""DR can start in young adulthood and often progresses quickly, leading to vision-threatening complications, including diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascularization that can lead to vision loss,"" said Dr. Marcus. ""Current treatment options include 'watchful waiting,' treatment requiring repeated anti-VEGF injections, retinal laser or surgical treatment. This first look at the ALTITUDE trial data is promising, as it shows not only clinical improvement in disease severity as measured by the ETDRS-DRSS, but also that this treatment is well tolerated in patients.""

<b>Study Design and Safety Update from Phase II ALTITUDE Trial of RGX-314 for the Treatment of DR Using Suprachoroidal Delivery</b>

ALTITUDE is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, controlled dose-escalation trial that will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of suprachoroidal delivery of RGX-314 using the SCS Microinjector<sup>®</sup> in patients with a DR diagnosis of moderately severe or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or mild proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Twenty patients in Cohort 1 were randomized to receive RGX-314 at a dose level of 2.5x10<sup>11</sup> genomic copies per eye (GC/eye) versus observational control at a 3:1 ratio. Cohort 2 will include 20 patients randomized to receive RGX-314 at an increased dose level of 5x10<sup>11</sup> GC/eye versus observational control at a 3:1 ratio. Cohort 3 is designed to evaluate RGX-314 at the same dose level as Cohort 2 in 20 patients who are neutralizing antibody (NAb) positive. Enrollment is ongoing in Cohorts 2 and 3. Patients in this trial do not receive prophylactic immune suppressive corticosteroid therapy before or after administration of RGX-314.

As of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 29, 2021</span>, RGX-314 was reported to be well tolerated in the 15 patients dosed with RGX-314 in Cohort 1. One serious adverse event was reported in one patient dosed with RGX-314, which occurred in the patient's untreated fellow eye and is considered not related to RGX-314. Among patients in Cohort 1 dosed with RGX-314, no intraocular inflammation was observed on slit-lamp examination. One patient experienced a mild case of episcleritis that resolved with topical corticosteroids. Common ocular treatment emergent adverse events in the study eye were not considered drug-related and were predominantly mild. These included conjunctival hemorrhage and conjunctival hyperemia.

<b>Summary of Data for Cohort 1 at Three Months</b>

Of the 15 patients dosed with RGX-314 in Cohort 1, five patients (33%) demonstrated a two-step or greater improvement from baseline on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study-Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (ETDRS-DRSS) at three months, compared to zero of the five patients (0%) in the observational control group. One patient dosed with RGX-314 had a four-step improvement.

In the seven patients who had NPDR (DR severity level 47-53) at baseline, three patients (43%) demonstrated a two-step or greater improvement at three months after administration of RGX-314. In the eight patients who had PDR (DR severity level = 61) at baseline, two patients (25%) demonstrated a two-step or greater improvement at three months after administration of RGX-314.

<b>About RGX-314</b>

RGX-314 is being investigated as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other chronic retinal conditions. RGX-314 consists of the NAV AAV8 vector, which encodes an antibody fragment designed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). RGX-314 is believed to inhibit the VEGF pathway by which new, leaky blood vessels grow and contribute to the accumulation of fluid in the retina.

REGENXBIO is advancing research in two separate routes of administration of RGX-314 to the eye, through a standardized subretinal delivery procedure as well as delivery to the suprachoroidal space. REGENXBIO has licensed certain exclusive rights to the SCS Microinjector<sup>®</sup> from Clearside Biomedical, Inc. to deliver gene therapy treatments to the suprachoroidal space of the eye.

<b>About Diabetic Retinopathy</b>

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of vision loss in adults between 24 and 75 years of age worldwide. DR affects approximately eight million people in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> alone. The spectrum of DR severity ranges from non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and as DR progresses, a large proportion of patients develop vision threatening complications, including diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascularization that can lead to blindness.  Current treatment options for patients with DR include ""watchful waiting"", anti-VEGF treatment, retinal laser or surgical treatment.

<b>About REGENXBIO Inc.</b>

 Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics today announced that Merck has submitted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for molnupiravir, an investigational oral antiviral medicine, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. The companies are actively working with regulatory agencies worldwide to submit applications for emergency use or marketing authorization in the coming months.

The submission is based on <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-and-ridgebacks-investigational-oral-antiviral-molnupiravir-reduced-the-risk-of-hospitalization-or-death-by-approximately-50-percent-compared-to-placebo-for-patients-with-mild-or-moderat%2F&amp;esheet=52506464&amp;newsitemid=20211011005110&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=positive+results+from+a+planned+interim+analysis&amp;index=1&amp;md5=daefcf1ccae1286dc60a96ce57560023"" rel=""nofollow"">positive results from a planned interim analysis</a> from the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT clinical trial, which evaluated molnupiravir in non-hospitalized adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were at risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. At the interim analysis, molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50%; 7.3% of patients who received molnupiravir were either hospitalized or died through Day 29 following randomization (28/385), compared with 14.1% of placebo-treated patients (53/377); p=0.0012. Through Day 29, no deaths were reported in patients who received molnupiravir, as compared to 8 deaths in patients who received placebo. The incidence of any adverse event was comparable in the molnupiravir and placebo groups (35% and 40%, respectively). The incidence of drug-related adverse events was also comparable (12% and 11%, respectively), and fewer subjects in the molnupiravir group discontinued therapy due to an adverse event compared to the placebo group (1.3% and 3.4%, respectively).

“The extraordinary impact of this pandemic demands that we move with unprecedented urgency, and that is what our teams have done by submitting this application for molnupiravir to the FDA within 10 days of receiving the data,” said Robert M. Davis, chief executive officer and president, Merck. “We are grateful to the patients and investigators in our study, and of course to our own colleagues who have exemplified Merck’s high standards of scientific excellence and our unwavering commitment to patients. I also want to take this moment to applaud our colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry and our collaborators in global health for rising to the challenge of bringing forward medicines and vaccines to fight COVID-19 — medicines and vaccines are both essential to our collective efforts. We look forward to working with the FDA on its review of our application, and to working with other regulatory agencies as we do everything we can to bring molnupiravir to patients around the world as quickly as possible.”

“We are grateful to the clinical investigators and patients who have helped bring us to this important milestone. Without their significant contributions, today’s achievement would not be possible. The submission to the FDA is a critical step towards making molnupiravir available to people who may benefit from an oral antiviral medicine that can be taken at home shortly after diagnosis with COVID-19,” said Wendy Holman, chief executive officer of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. “We are pleased to partner with Merck and regulatory authorities to help provide molnupiravir to the people who need it here in the U.S. and around the world.”

<b>About Merck’s Efforts to Enable Access to Molnupiravir, if it is Granted EUA or Approval</b>

In anticipation of the results from MOVe-OUT and the potential for regulatory authorization or approval, Merck has been producing molnupiravir at risk and expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by the end of 2021, with more courses expected to be produced in 2022.

Earlier this year, Merck <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-announces-supply-agreement-with-u-s-government-for-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-candidate-for-treatment-of-mild-to-moderate-covid-19%2F&amp;esheet=52506464&amp;newsitemid=20211011005110&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=entered&amp;index=2&amp;md5=c96745822cc33af24b91d51c64f2acd8"" rel=""nofollow"">entered</a> into a procurement agreement with the U.S. Government under which the company will supply approximately 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir to the U.S. Government, upon EUA or approval from the U.S. FDA. Additionally, Merck has entered into supply and advance purchase agreements for molnupiravir with other governments worldwide, pending regulatory authorization, and is currently in discussions with additional governments.

Merck is committed to providing timely access to molnupiravir globally, if it is authorized or approved, and plans to implement a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria to reflect countries’ relative ability to finance their health response to the pandemic.

As part of its commitment to widespread global access, Merck previously <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Famid-humanitarian-crisis-in-india-merck-announces-voluntary-licensing-agreements-with-five-indian-generics-manufacturers-to-accelerate-and-expand-global-access-to-molnupiravir-an-investigational-ora%2F&amp;esheet=52506464&amp;newsitemid=20211011005110&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=3&amp;md5=9ec822f5367361e0058fe7e841390421"" rel=""nofollow"">announced</a> that the company has entered into non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for molnupiravir with established Indian generic manufacturers to accelerate availability of molnupiravir in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies.

<b>About Molnupiravir</b>

Molnupiravir (MK-4482/EIDD-2801) is an investigational, orally administered form of a potent ribonucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Molnupiravir has been shown to be active in several preclinical models of SARS-CoV-2, including for prophylaxis, treatment, and prevention of transmission. Additionally, pre-clinical and clinical data have shown molnupiravir to be active against the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Molnupiravir was invented at Drug Innovations at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, a not-for-profit biotechnology company wholly owned by Emory University; Emory/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health. Molnupiravir is being developed by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of molnupiravir have been provided by Merck and by Wayne and Wendy Holman of Ridgeback.

Molnupiravir is also being evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis in MOVe-AHEAD, a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households.

<b>About the MOVe-OUT Study</b>

The MOVe-OUT trial (MK-4482-002) (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04575597%3Fterm%3Dmolnupiravir%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&amp;esheet=52506464&amp;newsitemid=20211011005110&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT04575597&amp;index=5&amp;md5=d135be8a6af82d7681de33e3045a1643"" rel=""nofollow"">NCT04575597</a>) is a global Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study of non-hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Patients enrolled in the study were unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, had at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes, and symptom onset within five days prior to randomization. The primary efficacy objective of MOVe-OUT is to evaluate the efficacy of molnupiravir compared to placebo as assessed by the percentage of participants who are hospitalized and/or die from the time of randomization through Day 29.

The Phase 3 portion of the MOVe-OUT trial was conducted globally, including in more than 170 planned sites in countries including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. For further information about the MOVe-OUT trial, please visit <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04575597%3Fterm%3Dmolnupiravir%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&amp;esheet=52506464&amp;newsitemid=20211011005110&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=clinicaltrials.gov&amp;index=6&amp;md5=2d42a0041dd1602480ee2baa1b9881e3"" rel=""nofollow"">clinicaltrials.gov</a>.

The most common risk factors for poor disease outcome included obesity, older age (&gt;60 years), diabetes mellitus and heart disease. Delta, Gamma and Mu variants accounted for nearly 80% of the baseline viral variants that had been sequenced at the time of the interim analysis. Recruitment in Latin America, Europe, and Africa accounted for 56%, 23% and 15% of the study population, respectively.

<p align=""justify"">Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUPN) and Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADMS), today announced a definitive agreement for Supernus to acquire Adamas through a tender offer for $8.10 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $400 million), payable at closing plus two non-tradable contingent value rights (CVR) collectively worth up to $1.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $50 million), for a total consideration of $9.10 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $450 million). The first CVR, worth $0.50 per share, is payable upon achieving net sales of GOCOVRI<sup>®</sup> of $150 million in any four consecutive quarters between closing and the end of 2024. The second CVR, worth $0.50 per share, is payable upon achieving net sales of GOCOVRI of $225 million in any four consecutive quarters between closing and the end of 2025. The transaction is expected to close in late fourth quarter 2021 or in early first quarter 2022.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The transaction will provide Supernus with two marketed products: GOCOVRI (amantadine) extended release capsules, the first and only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medicine indicated for the treatment of both OFF and dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy; and Osmolex ER<sup>®</sup> (amantadine) extended release tablets, approved for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions in adult patients.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“This acquisition represents a significant step to further build a strong and diverse Parkinson’s disease portfolio, and aligns with our focus of acquiring value-enhancing, clinically-differentiated medicines to treat CNS diseases,” said Jack Khattar, President and CEO of Supernus Pharmaceuticals. “We have a proven track record of strong commercial execution, and look forward to building on GOCOVRI’s growth momentum so that more patients can benefit from access to Adamas’ innovative neurological therapies.""</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Strategic and Financial Benefits</strong></p>

<ul type=""square"">
 	<li>Strengthens Parkinson’s disease portfolio with GOCOVRI (amantadine) extended release capsules, the first and only FDA-approved medicine indicated for the treatment of both OFF and dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy.</li>
 	<li>Diversifies and increases revenue base and cash flow
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Net sales of GOCOVRI were $71.2 million and $37.7 million in 2020 and for the first six months of 2021, respectively.</li>
 	<li>Combined with the acquisition of US WorldMeds CNS products in 2020, this transaction significantly reduces the reliance on net sales of Trokendi XR<sup>®</sup>. In the first half of 2021 and on a combined proforma basis (including revenue from US WorldMeds and Adamas transactions), net sales of Trokendi XR<sup>®</sup> represent 48% of Supernus revenues down from 72% (excluding revenue from these transactions).</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Potential synergies of $60 million to $80 million in year one due to strong overlap with existing infrastructure.</li>
 	<li>The acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive in 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">“We are pleased that Supernus recognized the value created at Adamas and firmly believe this path forward is an excellent outcome for not only our shareholders, but all our stakeholders,” said Neil F. McFarlane, Chief Executive Officer of Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “With their shared commitment to helping patients affected by neurological diseases and their extensive resources, Supernus can continue to advance our mission and reach. I am extremely proud of Team Adamas for their hard work and dedication to get us to this point and am confident that partnering with Supernus will maximize the potential of our innovative therapies.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Terms and Financing</strong>
Under the terms of the agreement, Supernus will commence a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for a purchase price of $8.10 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $400 million) payable at closing plus two non-tradable CVRs. All cash consideration will be funded through existing balance sheet cash.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The CVR entitles Adamas stockholders to receive up to an additional $1.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $50 million) payable upon GOCOVRI achieving certain net sales milestones within specified periods (subject to the terms and conditions contained in a Contingent Value Rights Agreement detailing the terms of the CVRs). These milestones include (i) $0.50 per share payable if in any four consecutive quarters between closing and the end of 2024, net sales of GOCOVRI achieving $150 million, and (ii) another $0.50 per share payable if in any four consecutive quarters between closing and the end of 2025, net sales of GOCOVRI achieving $225 million. There can be no assurance any payments will be made with respect to the CVR.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Approvals and Timing of Close</strong>
The transaction, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is expected to close in late fourth quarter 2021 or in early first quarter 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Adamas' common stock. Following the successful closing of the tender offer, Supernus will acquire any shares of Adamas that are not tendered in the tender offer through a second-step merger at the same consideration as paid in the tender offer.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Full Year Financial Guidance</strong>

Positive high-level results from the TACKLE Phase III COVID-19 treatment trial showed AstraZeneca's AZD7442, a long acting antibody (LAAB) combination, achieved a statistically significant reduction in severe COVID-19 or death compared to placebo in non-hospitalised patients with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19.

A total of 90% of participants enrolled were from populations at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19, including those with co-morbidities.

The trial met the primary endpoint, with a dose of 600mg of AZD7442 given by intramuscular (IM) injection reducing the risk of developing severe COVID-19 or death (from any cause) by 50% compared to placebo in outpatients who had been symptomatic for seven days or less. The trial recorded 18 events in the AZD7442 arm (18/407) and 37 in the placebo arm (37/415). The LAAB was generally well tolerated in the trial.

In a prespecified analysis of participants who received treatment within five days of symptom onset, AZD7442 reduced the risk of developing severe COVID-19 or death (from any cause) by 67% compared to placebo, with nine events in the AZD7442 arm (9/253) and 27 in the placebo arm (27/251).

AZD7442 is the first LAAB with Phase III data to demonstrate benefit in both prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 and is easily administered by IM injection.

Hugh Montgomery, Professor of Intensive Care Medicine at University College London, and TACKLE principal investigator, said: “With continued cases of serious COVID-19 infections across the globe, there is a significant need for new therapies like AZD7442 that can be used to protect vulnerable populations from getting COVID-19 and can also help prevent progression to severe disease. These positive results show that a convenient intramuscular dose of AZD7442 could play an important role in helping combat this devastating pandemic.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, AstraZeneca, said: “These important results for AZD7442, our long-acting antibody combination, add to the growing body of evidence for use of this therapy in both prevention and treatment of COVID-19. An early intervention with our antibody can give a significant reduction in progression to severe disease, with continued protection for more than six months.”

TACKLE included 903 participants in a 1:1 randomisation AZD7442 to placebo. The primary analysis was based on 822 participants.

AstraZeneca will be discussing the data with health authorities. On 5 October 2021, the Company <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd7442-request-for-emergency-use-authorization-for-covid-19-prophylaxis-filed-in-us.html#:~:text=AstraZeneca%20has%20submitted%20a%20request,EUA%20for%20COVID%2D19%20prevention."">announced</a> that it had submitted a request to the US Food and Drug Administration for Emergency Use Authorisation for AZD7442 for prophylaxis of COVID-19.

Full results from TACKLE will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

<b>Notes</b>

<b>TACKLE
</b>TACKLE is a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial assessing the safety and efficacy of a single 600mg IM dose of AZD7442 compared to placebo for the outpatient treatment of COVID-19. <a id=""_Hlk68603339"" name=""_Hlk68603339""></a>The trial was conducted in 96 sites in Brazil, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russian Federation, Spain, Ukraine, UK and US. 903 participants were randomised (1:1) to receive either AZD7442 (n = 452) or saline placebo (n = 451), administered in two separate, sequential IM injections.

Participants were adults 18 years-old and over who were non-hospitalised with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and symptomatic for seven days or less. Participants had a documented laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by a molecular test (antigen or nucleic acid) from any respiratory tract specimen (e.g. oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, or nasal swab or saliva) collected no more than three days prior to day one.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of either severe COVID-19 or death from any cause through day 29. Subjects will continue to be followed for 15 months.

Approximately 13% of participants were 65 years and over. In addition, 90% had baseline co-morbidities and other characteristics that put them at high risk of progression to<a id=""_Hlk80196817"" name=""_Hlk80196817""></a> severe COVID-19, including cancer, diabetes, obesity, chronic lung disease or asthma, cardiovascular disease or immunosuppression. Approximately 62% were White/Caucasian, 4% Black/African-American, 6% Asian and 24% American Indian or Alaskan Native. Approximately 52% of participants were Hispanic/Latino.

<b>AZD7442
</b>AZD7442 is a combination of two LAABs - tixagevimab (AZD8895) and cilgavimab (AZD1061) - derived from B-cells donated by convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 virus. Discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/articles/2020/advancing-our-discovery-of-novel-coronavirus-neutralising-antibodies-against-covid-19.html"">licensed to AstraZeneca in June 2020</a>, the human monoclonal antibodies bind to distinct sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein<sup>1</sup> and were optimised by AstraZeneca with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor and complement C1q binding. The half-life extension more than triples the durability of its action compared to conventional antibodies and could afford up to 12 months of protection from COVID-19 following a single administration<sup>2-4</sup>; data from the Phase I trial show high neutralising antibody titres for at least nine months.<sup>5</sup> The reduced Fc receptor binding aims to minimise the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease - a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies promote, rather than inhibit, infection and/or disease.<sup>6</sup>

In August 2021, AstraZeneca <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd7442-prophylaxis-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html"">announced</a> AZD7442 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 in the PROVENT Phase III pre-exposure prevention trial.

AZD7442 is also being studied as a potential treatment for hospitalised COVID-19 patients as part of the National Institute of Health’s <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04501978"" rel=""link-confirmation"">ACTIV-3 trial</a> and in an additional collaborator hospitalisation treatment trial.

AZD7442 is being developed with support from the US Government, including federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in partnership with the Department of Defense; Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, under Contract No. W911QY-21-9-0001.

In preclinical experiments, data show the LAABs were able to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to host cells and protect against infection in cell and animal models of disease.<sup>7</sup> Additional <i>in vitro</i> findings demonstrate AZD7442 neutralises recent emergent SARS-CoV-2 viral variants, including the Delta and Mu variants.<sup>8</sup>

Under the terms of the licensing agreement with Vanderbilt, AstraZeneca will pay single-digit royalties on future net sales.

(Nasdaq: FLXN) today announced a definitive agreement pursuant to which Pacira will acquire Flexion for $8.50 per share in cash, plus one non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR) worth up to $8.00 per share in cash. The CVR is payable (subject to certain terms and conditions) in the event certain sales and/or regulatory milestones are achieved, as set forth in more detail below. The transaction was unanimously approved by the board of directors of each of Pacira and Flexion.

Flexion is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel, local non-opioid therapies for the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, including osteoarthritis (OA), postsurgical pain and low back pain. Approved in 2017, Flexion’s lead product, ZILRETTA<sup>®</sup> (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension) is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for OA knee pain utilizing extended-release microsphere technology.

“This acquisition is a major milestone in our strategy to build a robust offering of novel, non-opioid treatments to improve patient care along the neural pain pathway while simultaneously providing us with a complementary commercial asset in ZILRETTA for the treatment of OA knee pain,” said Dave Stack, chairman and chief executive officer of Pacira. “We believe the Flexion portfolio further solidifies Pacira as a leader in opioid-sparing pain management as we continue to redefine the role of opioids as a last resort rescue medication. Importantly, this acquisition creates diversification and growth to our topline while providing what we would expect to be meaningful synergies that should result in substantial near- and long-term accretion to our cash flows and earnings.”

“Pacira shares our commitment to advancing non-opioid pain control and we believe it is ideally positioned to drive continued clinical and commercial success of ZILRETTA, FX201, and FX301,” said Michael Clayman, M.D., chief executive officer and co-founder of Flexion. “This combination with Pacira offers Flexion stakeholders excellent prospects for value creation, particularly as the contingent value rights provide the opportunity to continue to benefit from the ongoing success of Flexion’s products and programs.”

“I’d like to thank all of our employees – past and present – for their extraordinary commitment and superb contributions that have translated into ZILRETTA, a medicine that matters, getting to increasing numbers of patients in need and to a pipeline of potentially transformative medicines,” continued Dr. Clayman.

<strong>Pacira Transaction Rationale</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Innovative non-opioid portfolio directly aligns with the Pacira mission to provide an opioid alternative to as many patients as possible and address medical needs along the neural pain pathway.</li>
 	<li>Flexion’s ZILRETTA is a non-opioid injection that will allow Pacira to offer a treatment to manage OA pain of the knee at an earlier stage of the patient’s journey along the neural pain pathway.</li>
 	<li>Complementary sales call points and clinical-stage pipeline offer significant cost synergies across research and development and commercial activities.</li>
 	<li>Adds multiple clinical milestones, including the initiation of a Phase 3 registration trial of ZILRETTA in shoulder osteoarthritis and the advancement of Phase 1 studies of FX201 for musculoskeletal pain, including OA, and FX301 as a lower extremity nerve block for postsurgical pain.</li>
 	<li>Immediately revenue generating and expected to be accretive to full-year 2022 earnings and significantly accretive thereafter.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Transaction Details</strong>

Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Pacira will commence a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Flexion for a purchase price of $8.50 per share in cash, plus one non-tradeable CVR. The CVR will entitle Flexion stockholders to up to an additional $8.00 per share in cash payable (subject to certain terms and conditions) upon achievement of the following milestones:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>$1.00 per share if total calendar year ZILRETTA net sales achieve $250 million;</li>
 	<li>$2.00 per share if total calendar year ZILRETTA net sales achieve $375 million;</li>
 	<li>$3.00 per share if total calendar year ZILRETTA net sales achieve $500 million;</li>
 	<li>$1.00 per share upon U.S. FDA approval of FX201; and</li>
 	<li>$1.00 per share upon U.S. FDA approval of FX301.</li>
</ul>
The milestones associated with each contingent cash payment must be achieved, if at all, on or before December 31, 2030. There can be no assurance any payments will be made with respect to the CVR. The transaction is not subject to any financing condition and Pacira will fund the transaction from its existing cash resources.

Flexion’s board of directors unanimously recommends that Flexion’s stockholders tender their shares in the tender offer. Additionally, Flexion’s directors and executive officers, or their affiliates, have (subject to certain terms and conditions) agreed to tender their shares in the tender offer.

<strong>Timing to Close</strong>

The transaction is anticipated to close during the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Flexion’s common stock. Following the successful closing of the tender offer, Pacira will acquire any shares of Flexion that are not tendered in the tender offer through a second-step merger at the same consideration as paid in the tender offer.

<strong>Third Quarter Performance and Guidance Update</strong>

Today Pacira and Flexion are providing the following preliminary unaudited results and updates for the third quarter of 2021. The financial information included in this press release is preliminary, unaudited, and subject to adjustment. It does not present all information necessary for an understanding of either company’s financial results for the third quarter or full year 2021.
<ul>
 	<li>EXPAREL net product sales of $121.9 million for the third quarter and $39.7 million for the month of September 2021, compared with $113.7 million and $39.5 million in the prior year, respectively. The number of EXPAREL selling days for the month of September was 21 in both 2021 and 2020. The elective surgery market faced additional pandemic-related challenges in August and September due to regional surges in COVID-19 delta variant cases, staffing shortages, and surgical fatigue from care teams addressing significant procedure backlogs. These variables began to subside in the latter part of September and Pacira expects the fourth quarter to reflect improving market dynamics.</li>
 	<li>iovera° net product sales of $4.2 million for the third quarter and $2.3 million for the month of September 2021, compared with $2.7 million and $1.1 million in the prior year, respectively.</li>
 	<li>Flexion expects that ZILRETTA net sales were in the range of $21 million to $23 million for the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter 2021 sales were negatively impacted, particularly in the second half of the quarter, by the following primary factors: (a) temporary disruptions from rebate program modifications, (b) pandemic-related challenges, and (c) several unanticipated manufacturing batch failures that led to short-dated ZILRETTA inventory resulting in smaller order sizes by physician practices and product returns from specialty distributors.</li>
 	<li>Consistent with Pacira practices, Flexion is withdrawing its ZILRETTA sales guidance for 2021.</li>

<strong>About EXPAREL</strong><sup>®</sup>

EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is indicated in patients 6 years of age and older for single-dose infiltration to produce postsurgical local analgesia, and in adults as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia. Safety and efficacy have not been established in other nerve blocks. Since its launch, EXPAREL has been used in over nine million patients. The product combines bupivacaine with DepoFoam<sup>®</sup>, a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a desired time period. EXPAREL represents the first and only multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the peri- or postsurgical setting. By utilizing the DepoFoam platform, a single dose of EXPAREL delivers bupivacaine over time, providing significant reductions in cumulative pain scores with up to a 78 percent decrease in opioid consumption; the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction was not demonstrated. Additional information is available at www.EXPAREL.com.

<strong>Important Safety Information about EXPAREL for Patients</strong>

EXPAREL should not be used in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. In studies in adults where EXPAREL was injected into a wound, the most common side effects were nausea, constipation, and vomiting. In studies in adults where EXPAREL was injected near a nerve, the most common side effects were nausea, fever, and constipation. In the study where EXPAREL was given to children, the most common side effects were nausea, vomiting, constipation, low blood pressure, low number of red blood cells, muscle twitching, blurred vision, itching, and rapid heartbeat. EXPAREL can cause a temporary loss of feeling and/or loss of muscle movement. How much and how long the loss of feeling and/or muscle movement depends on where and how much of EXPAREL was injected and may last for up to 5 days. EXPAREL is not recommended to be used in patients younger than 6 years old for injection into the wound, for patients younger than 18 years old for injection near a nerve, and/or in pregnant women. Tell your health care provider if you or your child has liver disease, since this may affect how the active ingredient (bupivacaine) in EXPAREL is eliminated from the body. EXPAREL should not be injected into the spine, joints, or veins. The active ingredient in EXPAREL can affect the nervous system and the cardiovascular system; may cause an allergic reaction; may cause damage if injected into the joints; and can cause a rare blood disorder.

The iovera° system is used to destroy tissue during surgical procedures by applying freezing cold. It can also be used to produce lesions in peripheral nervous tissue by the application of cold to the selected site for the blocking of pain. It is also indicated for the relief of pain and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee for up to 90 days. In one study, the majority of the patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee experienced pain and system relief beyond 150 days. The iovera° system’s “1×90” Smart Tip configuration (indicating one needle which is 90 mm long) can also facilitate target nerve location by conducting electrical nerve stimulation from a separate nerve stimulator. The iovera° system is not indicated for treatment of central nervous system tissue.

<strong>Important Safety Information for iovera°</strong><sup>®</sup>

The iovera° system is contraindicated for use in patients with the following: Cryoglobulinemia; Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria; cold urticaria; Raynaud’s disease; open and/or infected wounds at or near the treatment line. Potential complications: As with any surgical treatment that uses needle-based therapy, there is potential for temporary site-specific reactions, including but not limited to: bruising (ecchymosis); swelling (edema); inflammation and/or redness (erythema); pain and/or tenderness; altered sensation (localized dysesthesia). Typically, these reactions resolve with no physician intervention. Patients may help the healing process by applying ice packs to the affected sites, and by taking over-the-counter analgesics.

<strong>About ZILRETTA </strong><strong><em>(triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension)</em></strong>

On October 6, 2017, ZILRETTA was approved by the U.S. FDA as the first and only extended-release intra-articular therapy for patients confronting OA-related knee pain. ZILRETTA employs proprietary microsphere technology combining triamcinolone acetonide—a commonly administered, short-acting corticosteroid—with a poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) matrix to provide extended pain relief. The pivotal Phase 3 trial on which the approval of ZILRETTA was based showed that ZILRETTA significantly reduced OA knee pain for 12 weeks, with some people experiencing pain relief through Week 16.

<strong>About FX201 </strong><strong><em>(humantakinogene</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>hadenovec)</em></strong>

FX201 is a novel, intra-articular gene therapy product candidate that utilizes a helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd) vector based on human serotype 5 (Ad5) that is designed to transfer a gene to cells in the joint to produce an anti-inflammatory protein, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), under the control of an inflammation-sensitive promoter. Inflammation is a known cause of pain, and chronic inflammation is thought to play a major role in the progression of OA. By persistently suppressing inflammation, Flexion believes FX201 holds the potential to provide long-term pain relief and functional improvement, and to modify disease progression. A Phase 1b study in patients with moderate to severe OA knee pain is currently being conducted. Flexion expects initial results by year end.

<strong>About FX301 </strong><strong><em>(funapide formulated in a proprietary thermosensitive hydrogel</em></strong><strong>)</strong>

FX301 is a locally administered NaV1.7 inhibitor product candidate, known as funapide, formulated for extended release in a thermosensitive hydrogel. The initial development of FX301 is intended to support administration as a peripheral nerve block for control of post-operative pain. FotF believes FX301 has the potential to provide effective and durable pain relief while preserving motor function. A Phase 1b study in patients undergoing bunionectomy surgery is currently being conducted. Flexion expects results by year end.

<strong>About Osteoarthritis of the Knee</strong>

OA, also known as degenerative joint disease, affects more than 30 million Americans and accounts for more than $185 billion in annual expenditures. In 2017, approximately 15 million Americans were diagnosed with OA of the knee and the average age of physician-diagnosed knee OA has fallen by 16 years, from 72 in the 1990s to 56 in the 2010s. The prevalence of OA is expected to continue to increase as a result of aging, obesity and sports injuries. Each year, approximately five million OA patients receive either a corticosteroid (immediate-release or extended-release) or hyaluronic acid intra-articular injection to manage their knee pain.

<p align=""justify"">Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, today shared new analyses and functional data from its SRP-9001 (rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin) development program and details of Study SRP-9001-301, known as EMBARK, its global pivotal Phase 3 trial of SRP-9001 for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. SRP-9001, being developed in partnership with Roche, is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In new analyses presented at “SRP-9001 Micro-dystrophin Day,” results from participants treated with SRP-9001 in Study SRP-9001-101 (n=4, ages 4 to 7) found that participants in Study 101 improved 8.6 points on the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA)* compared to a matched natural history cohort three years following a single administration of SRP-9001 (p&lt;0.0001). In Study SRP-9001-102, SRP-9001-treated participants ages 6 to 7 (n=12) had a positive 2.9-point difference on NSAA change from baseline compared to a matched natural history control (p=0.0129).</p>
<p align=""justify"">In addition, the first functional results were presented from Study SRP-9001-103 (ENDEAVOR), which uses commercially representative SRP-9001 material. Results from the first 11 participants in Cohort 1, ages 4 to 7, demonstrated a 3.0-point improvement from baseline on NSAA six months after treatment.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“With 77 patients treated to date, the multi-study development program for SRP-9001 represents the most comprehensive and long-term dataset for a Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy in existence. The totality of evidence shows that SRP-9001 is a significantly differentiated gene therapy product candidate with one-time dosing and a stable tolerability profile, results in robust expression and evidence of sustained functional benefits across our various studies,” said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive officer, Sarepta. “We commence our EMBARK pivotal trial – currently the only truly global Phase 3 trial with a Duchenne gene therapy – with great conviction in the transformative potential of SRP-9001. But while our expression, tolerability, functional evidence and CMC achievements may place SRP-9001 alone among potential therapies, we never forget that we remain in a daily race against a life-ending degenerative disease. To that end, Sarepta, along with our partner Roche, will continue working with tenacity and urgency to bring this potentially transformative treatment to individuals with Duchenne around the world.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“When compared to a matched natural history cohort, individuals with Duchenne who received SRP-9001 are performing better on the NSAA or showing stabilization of NSAA scores where we would expect to see a decline. The functional results from Study 103, as early as 6 months following treatment, provide additional confidence in our ability to confirm a treatment effect with SRP-9001 as we advance our pivotal Phase 3 trial,” said Louise Rodino-Klapac, Ph.D., executive vice president and chief scientific officer, Sarepta. “Given our experience with the AAVrh74 vector in more than 80 individuals with Duchenne and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, we are very encouraged by the sustained and meaningful clinical results and consistency of the safety profile of SRP-9001.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001 is similar to past reports. Across all three studies, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) generally occurred within 90 days of treatment and subsequently resolved. No clinically relevant complement activation was observed? in any of the studies. The most common treatment-related adverse event was vomiting, generally within the first week post-infusion. Increases in liver enzymes were transient and responsive to steroids?. In Study 9001-103, safety data were consistent with data from previous studies of SRP-9001 (101 and 102). There was one immune-mediated myositis serious adverse event in Cohort 2? specific to the participant’s mutation; participant received treatment including plasmapheresis and has since returned to pre-event function.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><em>About the SRP-9001 Clinical Development Program</em></strong>
The SRP-9001 clinical development program currently consists of four studies:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>EMBARK, Study SRP-9001-301:</strong> a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of commercially representative SRP-9001 material in 120 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy between the ages of 4 to 7. The primary endpoint will assess the change in NSAA total score from baseline to week 52 compared to placebo.Key features of EMBARK include stratification of participants by age and baseline NSAA, with a minimum of 50 percent of patients ages 4 to 5 enrolled. Inclusion criteria include a stable daily dose of oral corticosteroids for at least 12 weeks before screening and rAAVrh74 antibody titers of less than 1:400. Participants with mutations between or including exons 1-17 or mutations fully contained within exon 45 (inclusive) are not eligible.

Secondary endpoints include the number of skills gained or improved at week 52 as measured by NSAA, the quantity of micro-dystrophin protein expression at week 12 (Part 1) as measured by western blot, timed function tests and safety. In Part 1, results from the treatment and placebo groups are compared through 52 weeks following treatment. In Part 2, the study remains blinded to investigators and participants while all participants in the placebo group cross over to active treatment and all participants are followed for another 52 weeks while safety and efficacy continue to be evaluated.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>ENDEAVOR, Study SRP-9001-103</strong> <strong>(Study 103): </strong>an open-label clinical trial of SRP-9001 that has enrolled 32 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with 20 participants ages 4 to 7 and expanded cohorts that include older ambulant and non-ambulant individuals. Study 103 uses commercially representative SRP-9001 material and the primary endpoint is the change from baseline in the quantity of micro-dystrophin protein expression measured by western blot at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include change from baseline in micro-dystrophin expression fiber intensity as measured by immuno-fluorescence and micro-dystrophin expression measured by IF percent dystrophin positive fibers at 12 weeks. Exploratory endpoints include the change in vector genome copies per nucleus, NSAA and certain timed functional tests. Including the initial 12-week period, patients will be followed for a total of five years.</li>
 	<li><strong>Study SRP-9001-102 (Study 102): </strong>a double-blind, 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of SRP-9001 in 41 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy between the ages of 4 to 7. Study 102 uses clinical process SRP-9001 material and has two primary endpoints: micro-dystrophin expression at 12 weeks and change in NSAA total score at 48 weeks compared to placebo. Secondary endpoints include certain timed functional tests; micro-dystrophin expression measured by immuno-fluorescence fiber intensity; and micro-dystrophin expression measured by immuno-fluorescence percent dystrophin positive fibers. In Part 1, results from the treatment and placebo groups are compared through 48 weeks following treatment. In Part 2, the study remains blinded while all participants in the placebo group cross over to active treatment and all participants are followed for another 48 weeks while safety and efficacy continue to be evaluated and for five years total after infusion.</li>
 	<li><strong>SRP-9001-101 (Study 101):</strong> a single-center, open-label clinical trial of SRP-9001 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and proof of concept of a single dose of clinical process SRP-9001 material. The trial enrolled 4 ambulatory participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy between the ages of 4 to 7. The primary endpoint was safety, and secondary endpoint included the change in micro-dystrophin expression pre- and post-treatment, decreases in creatine kinase, NSAA total score and timed function test. Participants are being followed for five years after treatment, while safety and efficacy continue to be evaluated.</li>
</ul>
*The NSAA is a 17-item rating scale that is used to measure functional motor abilities in ambulant children with Duchenne. It is used to monitor the progression of the disease and treatment effects which makes it suitable as an endpoint in clinical trials for Duchenne.
<p align=""justify""><strong><em>About SRP-9001 (rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin)</em></strong>
SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver the micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein. Sarepta is responsible for global development and manufacturing for SRP-9001 and plans to commercialize SRP-9001 in the United States upon receiving FDA approval. In December 2019, Roche partnered with Sarepta to combine Roche’s global reach, commercial presence and regulatory expertise with Sarepta’s gene therapy candidate for Duchenne to accelerate access to SRP-9001 for patients outside the United States. Sarepta has exclusive rights to the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program initially developed at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><em>About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</em></strong>
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, fatal neuromuscular genetic disease that occurs in approximately one in every 3,500-5,000 males worldwide. DMD is caused by a change or mutation in the gene that encodes instructions for dystrophin. Symptoms of DMD usually appear in infants and toddlers. Affected children may experience developmental delays such as difficulty in walking, climbing stairs or standing from a sitting position. As the disease progresses, muscle weakness in the lower limbs spreads to the arms and other areas. Most patients require full-time use of a wheelchair in their early teens, and then progressively lose the ability to independently perform activities of daily living such as using the restroom, bathing and feeding. Eventually, increasing difficulty in breathing due to respiratory muscle dysfunction requires ventilation support, and cardiac dysfunction can lead to heart failure. The condition is universally fatal, and patients usually succumb to the disease in their twenties.</p>

Swedish biotech company Salipro Biotech AB today announced that it has entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement with AbCellera for access to its proprietary Salipro<sup>®</sup> Platform, which stabilizes challenging G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), ion channel, and transporter antigens.

""We are excited to build on the success of our previous studies and deepen our relationship with the team at AbCellera,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jens Frauenfeld</span>, CEO of Salipro Biotech. ""We look forward to deploying our expertise and our platform technology to generate Salipro<sup>®</sup>-stabilized antigens of challenging membrane proteins to enable AbCellera's discovery programs against these drug targets.""

Under the terms of the agreement, Salipro Biotech will receive an upfront payment, research payments and is eligible for downstream milestone payments for a defined number of targets.

<b>About Salipro Biotech AB</b>

Salipro Biotech AB is a privately held biotech company focused on unlocking challenging drug targets for the development of next-generation therapeutics. The company is headquartered in <span class=""xn-location"">Stockholm, Sweden</span> with a fully owned IP portfolio that covers the Salipro<sup>®</sup> platform technology for the stabilization of membrane proteins.

The majority of drug targets are so-called membrane proteins; however, these targets are inherently unstable and challenging to investigate. The proprietary Salipro<sup>®</sup> technology stabilizes membrane proteins in their native forms, enabling them to be employed in drug discovery programs for therapeutic antibodies, small molecule drugs and structure-based drug design.

To date, Salipro Biotech has signed multiple research collaborations with top-tier pharma and biotech companies. Through in-house and partnered pipelines, Salipro Biotech AB accelerates the discovery of novel drugs.

Under the terms of the agreement, BioNova has the option to obtain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize STRO-001 in Greater China. BioNova will pursue the clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of STRO-001 in multiple indications, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia in the licensed territory. Sutro will retain development and commercial rights of STRO-001 globally outside of <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span>, including <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>. BioNova will pay to Sutro an initial licensing option payment of <span class=""xn-money"">$4 million</span>, with potential payments totaling up to <span class=""xn-money"">$200 million</span> related to option exercise, development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. Sutro will provide STRO-001 to BioNova under appropriate clinical and commercial supply service agreements. Upon commercialization, Sutro will receive tiered, double-digit royalties based on annual net sales of STRO-001 in Greater China.

""This strategic partnership of STRO-001 at this stage of its clinical development demonstrates the shared vision of Sutro and BioNova of the potential for this promising ADC,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Bill Newell</span>, Chief Executive Officer of Sutro. ""We believe BioNova is an ideal partner, having demonstrated success in business and clinical development and backed by marquee healthcare investors, to realize the potential for STRO-001 in multiple hematological cancers in <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span>, where there is a large unmet medical need.""

We are approaching optimized dose levels in our dose-escalation trial—5.0 mg/kg in the multiple myeloma cohort and 4.2mg/kg in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cohort.""

Ye Hua, MD, MPH, founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioNova added, ""We are excited to collaborate with Sutro, a leading ADC technology company with a proprietary protein synthesis platform, to develop and commercialize STRO-001 in <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span>. STRO-001 has shown encouraging early efficacy signals and good tolerability profile in relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies in the Phase 1 dose-escalation study. Given our strength in drug development in <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span>, we are committed to expedite the development of STRO-001 into Phase 2 expansion in multiple hematologic malignancies to fully explore the therapeutic potential of this ADC. The partnership further strengthens BioNova's position in hematology and brings synergistic potential to our existing pipeline.""

<b>About STRO-001<br class=""dnr"" /></b>STRO-001 is a CD74-targeting ADC, based on Sutro's integrated cell-free protein synthesis and site-specific conjugation platform, XpressCF+™, currently being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Sutro is currently enrolling patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a dose-escalation trial and the maximum tolerated dose has not yet been reached. STRO-001 was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for multiple myeloma in <span class=""xn-chron"">October 2018</span>.

<b>About Sutro Biopharma</b> <br class=""dnr"" />Sutro Biopharma, Inc., located in <span class=""xn-location"">South San Francisco</span>, is a clinical-stage drug discovery, development, and manufacturing company. Using precise protein engineering and rational design, Sutro is advancing next-generation oncology therapeutics.

Sutro's proprietary and integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform XpressCF<sup>®</sup> and site-specific conjugation platform XpressCF+™ led to the discovery of STRO-001 and STRO-002, Sutro's first two internally-developed ADCs. STRO-001 is a CD74-targeting ADC currently under investigation in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with advanced B-cell malignancies, and was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for multiple myeloma. STRO-002, a folate receptor alpha (FolRa)-targeting ADC, is currently being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers and was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for ovarian cancer. A third product candidate, CC-99712, a BCMA-targeting ADC, which is part of Sutro's collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb, formerly Celgene Corporation, is enrolling patients for its Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma and has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA. A fourth product candidate, M1231, a MUC1-EGFR, first-in-class bispecific ADC, which is part of Sutro's collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, known as EMD Serono in the U.S. and Canada (EMD Serono), is enrolling patients for its Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with metastatic solid tumors, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These four product candidates above being evaluated in clinical trials resulted from Sutro's XpressCF<sup>®</sup> and XpressCF+™ technology platforms. Bristol <span class=""xn-person"">Myers Squibb</span> and EMD Serono have worldwide development and commercialization rights for CC-99712 and M1231, respectively, for which Sutro is entitled to milestone or contingent payments and tiered royalties.

Sutro is dedicated to transforming the lives of cancer patients by creating medicines with improved therapeutic profiles for areas of unmet need. To date, Sutro's platform has led to ADCs, bispecific antibodies, cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapies, and vaccines directed at precedented targets in clinical indications where the current standard of care is suboptimal.

The platform allows it to accelerate discovery and development of potential first-in-class and best-in-class molecules through rapid and systematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships to create optimized homogeneous product candidates. In addition to developing its own oncology pipeline, Sutro is collaborating with select pharmaceutical and biotech companies to discover and develop novel, next-generation therapeutics.

<div class=""xn-content"">

Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: PTGX) (""Protagonist"" or ""the Company"") today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has removed the full clinical hold on the Company's rusfertide clinical studies, announced on September 17, 2021. Per the FDA, dosing in all clinical studies of rusfertide may be resumed.

The Company provided the FDA with all requested information as the basis for a Complete Response and subsequent removal of the clinical hold. In particular, the Company provided the requested individual patient clinical safety reports, updated the investigator brochure and patient informed consent forms, performed a comprehensive review of the most recent safety database, and included new safety and stopping rules in the study protocols. The Company is working closely with study investigators and clinical trial sites to resume dosing of patients in ongoing clinical trials with rusfertide after patients have been reconsented.

The clinical hold was initially triggered by a recent non-clinical finding in a 26-week rasH2 transgenic mouse model indicating benign and malignant subcutaneous skin tumors. The rasH2 signal also prompted a re-examination of the four cases of cancer observed across all rusfertide clinical trials involving over 160 patients, and a comprehensive review of the safety database, including cases of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR). No additional cancer cases, and no other unexpected safety signals, surfaced in this process.

""We are extremely pleased that the FDA has acted so quickly in lifting the clinical hold on the rusfertide development program, allowing us to resume patient dosing in our clinical studies,"" said Dinesh Patel, <span id=""spanHghlt2ab8"">Ph.D.,</span> President and Chief Executive Officer of Protagonist. ""Patient safety continues to be our topmost priority. We believe that the cumulative evidence regarding the safety and clinical risk-benefit of rusfertide is supportive of expedited clinical development. We are actively preparing to initiate the phase 3 registrational study for polycythemia vera in the first quarter of 2022. Protagonist will continue to work closely with the FDA to ensure patient safety with amendments to current and planned future studies with rusfertide. We remain optimistic about the future potential of rusfertide to address unmet medical needs in excessive erythrocytosis and iron overload related diseases like polycythemia vera and hereditary hemochromatosis, respectively.""

Spark Therapeutics, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) and a fully integrated, commercial gene therapy company dedicated to challenging the inevitability of genetic disease, and CombiGene AB (‘CombiGene’) today announced the signing of an exclusive collaboration and licensing agreement for CombiGene’s CG01 project, an investigational gene therapy which aims to treat drug resistant focal epilepsy. The agreement provides Spark with the exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize CG01. CombiGene will continue to execute certain aspects of the preclinical program in collaboration with Spark.

“Spark is constantly evaluating new opportunities to challenge the status quo when it comes to the treatment of genetic diseases and collaboration is a critical part of our strategy,” said Joseph La Barge, chief business officer, Spark Therapeutics. “We were impressed by CombiGene’s gene therapy platform and look forward to harnessing our collective expertise to tackle diseases that affect the central nervous system.”

“While many people with epilepsy respond well to current anti-seizure therapies, a significant portion are in need of new treatment options,” said Federico Mingozzi, Ph.D., chief scientific officer, Spark Therapeutics. “Through our new collaboration and licensing agreement with CombiGene, we will work together leveraging our vast knowledge and experience in gene therapy to address unmet needs for people living with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.”

“This is a momentous day for CombiGene. Together with our partners and with the support of our shareholders and with an important contribution from the EU program Horizon 2020, we have worked long and hard to arrive at this deal with Spark, and I could not be more proud,” stated Jan Nilsson, chief executive officer, CombiGene. “Our epilepsy project CG01 has continued to show strength throughout the preclinical phase, and in Spark we have now found a perfect partner to take CG01 through the clinical phase to full commercialization. CombiGene and Spark have had a productive ongoing dialogue during the latter parts of CG01’s preclinical development, and the entire CombiGene team have come to know Spark as a visionary and patient-focused organization with the strength, know-how, and experience to exploit the full potential of CG01. We look forward to advancing this potentially transformative therapy together with Spark for the benefit of a patient group in need of better treatments.”

<p align=""justify""><strong>About Ultimovacs</strong>
Ultimovacs is developing immune-stimulatory vaccines to treat a broad range of cancers. Ultimovacs’ lead universal cancer vaccine candidate UV1 targets human telomerase (hTERT), present in over 80% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. By directing the immune system to hTERT antigens, UV1 drives CD4 helper T cells to the tumor to activate an immune system cascade and increase anti-tumor responses. With a broad Phase II program, Ultimovacs aims to clinically demonstrate UV1’s impact in multiple cancer types in combination with other immunotherapies. Ultimovacs’ second technology approach, based on the proprietary Tetanus-Epitope-Targeting (TET) platform, combines tumor-specific peptides and adjuvant in the same molecule and entered Phase I studies in 2021.</p>

<p align=""justify"">Sanofi’s investigational oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, tolebrutinib, demonstrated favorable one-year tolerability in a Phase 2b long-term extension study (LTS) in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). The results showed that after 48 weeks of treatment, tolebrutinib reduced multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These data are being presented as ePosters at the 37th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) on October 13 – 15, 2021.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“</em><em>Understanding the ability of a brain-penetrant therapy to slow disability accumulation has the potential to bring new hope to </em><em>people</em><em> suffering from</em><em> difficult-to-treat MS</em><em>. </em><em>For nearly two decades, Sanofi has been unwavering in its efforts to accelerate research and treatment options</em><em> for</em> <em>these patients</em><em>,</em><em>”</em> says Erik Wallström, M.D., Ph.D., Therapeutic Area Head, Neurology Development at Sanofi.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Ninety-eight percent (122/125) of LTS-treated patients remained in the Phase 2b extension study through Week 48. The extension study was designed to evaluate the safety of tolebrutinib and provided the opportunity to evaluate efficacy parameters and report MRI outcomes. The LTS consisted of Part A, a double-blind treatment period where patients continued the same tolebrutinib dose as administered in the dose-finding study (5, 15, 30 or 60mg/day) and Part B, where all participants switched to the 60mg tablet (5/60mg, 15/60mg, 30/60mg, 60/60mg), which is the dose being tested in the Phase 3 trials.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“Results showed favorable safety and efficacy for tolebrutinib, and nearly all patients remained enrolled at the one-year mark of the long-term extension study,”</em> says Anthony Traboulsee, M.D., Professor and Research Chair, MS Society of Canada at University of British Columbia and Phase 2b Extension Study Investigator. <em>""Evaluating</em><em> the </em><em>impact</em><em> BTK inhibitors </em><em>can have </em><em>on preventing </em><em>disability accumulation is critical to addressing the needs of </em><em>people</em><em> living with MS.</em><em> These long-term outcomes of tolebrutinib reinforce its potential as a new treatment option for MS patients.""</em></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Safety and Efficacy </strong><strong>Outcomes</strong><strong>:</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Safety data showed continued favorable tolerability of tolebrutinib and no new safety signals. The most frequent AEs were headache (10%), COVID-19 (9%), upper respiratory tract infection (8%) and nasopharyngitis (7%).</li>
 	<li>At baseline, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores across treatment groups ranged from 2.18 to 2.65. Over 48 weeks of treatment, mean EDSS scores remained relatively stable in all treatment groups. For the 60/60mg treatment group, mean (SD) score was 2.65 (1.22) at baseline and 2.45 (1.31) at Week 48.</li>
 	<li>Patients treated with tolebrutinib 60mg experienced low annualized relapse rate (ARR) of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.29) over the 48-week treatment period. The majority of patients (89.5%) were free of relapses during this period. The relapse rate for these patients was 1.23 in the year prior to the Phase 2b study.</li>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>At Week 48 of the extension study, the mean number of new Gd-enhancing lesions/scan remained low (&lt;0.4) in the 60/60mg arm. Patients who switched to 60mg in Part B (Weeks 15-47) of the LTS experienced a reduction in Gd-enhancing lesions, approaching values observed in the 60/60mg treatment arm.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">The company also presented data on the effect of tolebrutinib on human microglia that support its capacity to modulate neuroinflammatory processes directly within the central nervous system (CNS). Results from this study extended upon previous findings in mouse microglial cells to show that BTK-dependent inflammatory signalling in human microglia and tri-cultures can be modulated using tolebrutinib <em>in vitro</em>. This research contributes to an improved understanding of BTK signalling in neuroinflammation and how BTK inhibitors target the neuroinflammation believed to contribute to disability progression in people with MS. Tolebrutinib is the only BTK inhibitor in development for MS which has been shown to directly modulate microglia, based on publicly available information.</p>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Eli Lilly and Company's (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-verzenio-abemaciclib-as-the-first-and-only-cdk46-inhibitor-for-certain-people-with-hr-her2--high-risk-early-breast-cancer-301398910.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">LLY</a>) Verzenio<sup>®</sup> (abemaciclib), in combination with endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor), for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-), node-positive, early breast cancer (EBC) at high risk of recurrence and a Ki-67 score of =20% as determined by an FDA-approved test. Ki-67 is a marker of cellular proliferation. Verzenio is the first and only CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for this patient population.

""Over time, the collective results of the Verzenio clinical development program have demonstrated a differentiated CDK4/6 inhibitor profile, and the landmark data from the monarchE trial that supported this new indication in HR+ HER2- early breast cancer represent another important step forward for people who are in need of new treatment options,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jacob Van Naarden</span>, senior vice president, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly and president, Lilly Oncology. ""We are pleased with this initial approval in the adjuvant setting and as these data continue to mature, we look forward to further opportunities to work with health authorities to expand the use of Verzenio in this setting.""

The Verzenio Phase 3 monarchE trial is a randomized (1:1), open-label, two cohort, multicenter study in adult women and men with HR+ HER2-, node-positive, resected EBC with clinical and pathological features consistent with a high risk of disease recurrence. In the trial, patients were randomized to receive two years of Verzenio 150 mg twice daily plus physician's choice of standard endocrine therapy, or standard endocrine therapy alone. Patients in both treatment arms were instructed to continue to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy for up to 5-10 years as recommended by their clinician. The primary endpoint of the study is invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and was met at a pre-specified interim analysis in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, with a statistically significant improvement in IDFS for patients treated with Verzenio plus ET compared to those treated with ET alone. Consistent with expert guidelines, IDFS was defined as the length of time before breast cancer comes back, any new cancer develops, or death.

Having achieved the study's primary endpoint in the entire enrolled population, a pre-specified analysis of IDFS was also conducted in patients with high-risk clinical and pathological factors and a Ki-67 score =20%. This subgroup analysis (N=2,003) included patients with =4 positive axillary lymph nodes (ALN), or 1-3 positive ALN with either Grade 3 disease and/or tumor size =5 cm, and whose tumors had a Ki-67 score of =20%. There was also a statistically significant improvement in IDFS for this pre-specified subgroup of patients receiving Verzenio plus ET compared to those who received ET alone (HR=0.643, 95% CI: 0.475, 0.872, p=0.0042).<sup>1,3</sup>

This approval is based on efficacy results from an analysis of this subgroup with additional follow-up, conducted post-hoc. In this analysis, Verzenio given in combination with ET continued to demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit, with a 37 percent decrease in the risk of breast cancer recurrence or death compared to standard adjuvant ET alone for patients with high risk clinical and pathological features and a Ki-67 score =20% (HR: 0.626 [95% CI: 0.49-0.80]), and an absolute benefit in IDFS event rate of 7.1 percent at three years. The number of IDFS events at the time of this analysis was 104 with Verzenio plus ET compared to 158 with ET alone. Overall survival data were not mature and additional follow up is ongoing.

Adverse reactions from monarchE were consistent with the known safety profile for Verzenio.<sup>2</sup> Safety and tolerability were evaluated in 5,591 patients. The most common adverse reactions reported (<u>&gt;</u>10%) in the Verzenio plus ET (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) arm, and <u>&gt;</u>2% higher than the ET arm alone, were diarrhea, infections, fatigue, nausea, headache, vomiting, stomatitis, decreased appetite, dizziness, rash, and alopecia.<sup>3</sup> The most common laboratory abnormalities (all grades =10%) were creatinine increased, white blood cell count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, anemia, lymphocyte count decreased, platelet count decreased, ALT increased, AST increased, and hypokalemia.

This FDA approval builds on the established body of evidence for Verzenio, which is already approved for the treatment of certain types of HR+ HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Concurrent with this approval, the FDA has expanded the use of Verzenio in all indications, when given in combination with endocrine therapy, to include men. Verzenio is available in tablet strengths of 200 mg, 150 mg, 100 mg, and 50 mg.

""The design and results of the monarchE study are practice-changing and represent the first advancement in adjuvant treatment of HR+ HER2- breast cancer in a very long time,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Sara M. Tolaney</span>, MD, MPH, <span class=""xn-org"">Harvard Medical School</span>, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and investigator on the monarchE study. ""This FDA approval for Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy in the early breast cancer setting has the potential to become a new standard of care for this population. We are encouraged by the marked reduction in the risk of recurrence even beyond the two-year treatment period in these patients, and I'm grateful to be able to offer this as a treatment option to my patients.""

""Women and men living with high risk HR+ HER2- early breast cancer want to do all they can to reduce the risk of the disease coming back, with the hope of living free of cancer. The approval of Verzenio provides a new treatment option to help them do just that,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jean Sachs</span>, chief executive officer, Living Beyond Breast Cancer. ""This approval brings new optimism to the breast cancer community.""

Data supporting this approval will be presented at the <span class=""xn-chron"">October 14</span> European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Plenary.

The labelling for Verzenio contains warnings and precautions for diarrhea, neutropenia, interstitial lung disease (ILD/pneumonitis), hepatotoxicity, venous thromboembolism, and embryo-fetal toxicity.  Instruct patients at the first sign of loose stools to initiate antidiarrheal therapy, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider. Perform complete blood counts and liver function tests prior to the start of Verzenio treatment, every two weeks for the first two months, monthly for the next two months and as clinically indicated. Based on results, Verzenio may require dose modification. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate.

A total of 5,637 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive two years of Verzenio 150 mg twice daily plus physician's choice of standard endocrine therapy, or standard endocrine therapy alone. Patients in both treatment arms were instructed to continue to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy for up to 5-10 years as recommended by their clinician. Cohort 1 enrolled patients with =4 positive axillary lymph nodes (ALN), or 1-3 positive ALN and either Grade 3 disease or tumor size =5 cm. Cohort 2 enrolled patients with 1-3 positive ALN and centrally determined Ki-67 score of =20%. The primary endpoint was IDFS in the ITT population (Cohorts 1 &amp; 2). Secondary endpoints were IDFS in patients with high Ki-67 score (in the ITT population and in the Cohort 1 population), DRFS, overall survival, and safety.<sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>3</sup><sup> </sup>

<b>About Early Breast Cancer and Risk of Recurrence<br class=""dnr"" /></b>It is estimated that 90 percent of all breast cancers are detected at an early stage. Although the prognosis for HR+ HER2- EBC is generally positive, 20 percent of patients will experience recurrence potentially to incurable metastatic disease.<sup>4</sup> Risk of recurrence is greatest within the initial two to three years post-diagnosis, particularly in patients with node-positive, high risk EBC.<sup>5</sup> Factors associated with high risk of recurrence include: positive nodal status, large tumor size (=5 cm), high tumor grade (Grade 3), and high rate of cellular proliferation [Ki-67 score (=20%)].<sup>3</sup>

Node-positive means that cancer cells from the tumor in the breast have been found in the lymph nodes in the armpit area. Although the breast cancer is removed through surgery, the presence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes signifies that there is a higher chance of the cancer returning and spreading.

<b>About Breast Cancer<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Breast cancer has now surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, according to GLOBOCAN. The estimated 2.3 million new cases indicate that 1 in every 8 cancers diagnosed in 2020 is breast cancer. With approximately 685,000 deaths in 2020, breast cancer is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death worldwide.<sup>6</sup> In the U.S., it is estimated that there will be 281,550 new cases of breast cancer in 2021.<sup>7</sup>

Approximately 70 percent of all breast cancers are of the HR+ HER2- subtype.<sup>7</sup>

<b>About Verzenio® (abemaciclib)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Verzenio<sup>®</sup> abemaciclib is a targeted treatment known as a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Verzenio is a non-chemotherapy oral tablet.

Verzenio works inside the cell to block CDK4/6 activity and help stop the growth of cancer cells, so they may eventually die (based on preclinical studies).* Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)4/6 are activated by binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation.

In vitro, continuous exposure to Verzenio inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis (cell death). Preclinically, Verzenio dosed daily without interruption resulted in reduction of tumor size. Inhibiting CDK4/6 in healthy cells can result in side effects, some of which may be serious. Clinical evidence also suggests that Verzenio crosses the blood-brain barrier. In patients with advanced cancer, including breast cancer, concentrations of Verzenio and its active metabolites (M2 and M20) in cerebrospinal fluid are comparable to unbound plasma concentrations.

Verzenio is Lilly's first solid oral dosage form to be made using a faster, more efficient process known as continuous manufacturing. Continuous manufacturing is a new and advanced type of manufacturing within the pharmaceutical industry, and Lilly is one of the first companies to use this technology.

<b>INDICATIONS FOR VERZENIO</b>

Verzenio<sup>®</sup> (abemaciclib) in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-), node-positive, early breast cancer (EBC) at high risk of recurrence and a Ki-67 score of =20% as determined by an FDA-approved test.

Verzenio is indicated for the treatment of HR+ HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer:
<ul>
 	<li>in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women, and men, as initial endocrine-based therapy</li>
 	<li>in combination with fulvestrant for adult patients with disease progression following endocrine therapy</li>
 	<li>as a single agent for adult patients with disease progression following endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting</li>
</ul>
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR VERZENIO (abemaciclib)</b>

Severe <b>diarrhea</b> associated with dehydration and infection occurred in patients treated with Verzenio.<b> </b>Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients<b>, </b>diarrhea<b> </b>occurred in 81 to 90% of patients who received Verzenio. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 8 to 20% of patients receiving Verzenio. Most patients experienced diarrhea during the first month of Verzenio treatment. The median time to onset of the first diarrhea event ranged from 6 to 8 days; and the median duration of Grade 2 and Grade 3 diarrhea ranged from 6 to 11 days and 5 to 8 days, respectively. Across trials, 19 to 26% of patients with diarrhea required a Verzenio dose interruption and 13 to 23% required a dose reduction.

Instruct patients to start antidiarrheal therapy, such as loperamide, at the first sign of loose stools, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider for further instructions and appropriate follow-up. For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, discontinue Verzenio until toxicity resolves to =Grade 1, and then resume Verzenio at the next lower dose.

<b>Neutropenia</b>, including febrile neutropenia and fatal neutropenic sepsis, occurred in patients treated with Verzenio. Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, neutropenia occurred in 37 to 46% of patients receiving Verzenio. A Grade =3 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) occurred in 19 to 32% of patients receiving Verzenio. Across trials, the median time to first episode of Grade =3 neutropenia ranged from 29 to 33 days, and the median duration of Grade =3 neutropenia ranged from 11 to 16 days. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in &lt;1% of patients exposed to Verzenio across trials.  Two deaths due to neutropenic sepsis were observed in MONARCH 2. Inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever to their healthcare provider.

Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of Verzenio therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.

Severe, life-threatening, or fatal <b>interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis</b> can occur in patients treated with Verzenio and other CDK4/6 inhibitors. In Verzenio-treated patients in EBC (monarchE), 3% of patients experienced ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.4% were Grade 3 or 4 and there was one fatality (0.1%). In Verzenio-treated patients in MBC (MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), 3.3% of Verzenio-treated patients had ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.6% had Grade 3 or 4, and 0.4% had fatal outcomes. Additional cases of ILD or pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported.

Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis. Symptoms may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for such symptoms should be excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Dose interruption or dose reduction is recommended in patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 ILD or pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue Verzenio in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis.

<b>Grade =3 increases in</b> <b>alanine aminotransferase (</b><b>ALT) </b>(2 to 6%) and <b>aspartate aminotransferase (</b><b>AST) </b>(2 to 3%) were reported in patients receiving Verzenio. Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), the median time to onset of Grade =3 ALT increases ranged from 57 to 87 days and the median time to resolution to Grade &lt;3 was 13 to 14 days. The median time to onset of Grade =3 AST increases ranged from 71 to 185 days and the median time to resolution to Grade &lt;3 ranged from 11 to 15 days.

Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) prior to the start of Verzenio therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2, or any Grade 3 or 4 hepatic transaminase elevation.

<b>Venous thromboembolic events (VTE)</b> were reported in 2 to 5% of patients across three clinical trials in 3559 patients treated with Verzenio (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3). VTE included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pelvic venous thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis, and inferior vena cava thrombosis. In clinical trials, deaths due to VTE have been reported in patients treated with Verzenio.

Verzenio has not been studied in patients with early breast cancer who had a history of VTE. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. Dose interruption is recommended for EBC patients with any grade VTE and for MBC patients with a Grade 3 or 4 VTE.

Verzenio can cause <b>fetal harm</b> when administered to a pregnant woman, based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Verzenio and for 3 weeks after the last dose. Based on findings in animals, Verzenio may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. There are no data on the presence of Verzenio in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during Verzenio treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.

<b>Strong </b><b>and moderate CYP3A inhibitors</b> increased the exposure of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites to a clinically meaningful extent and may lead to increased toxicity. Avoid concomitant use of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is predicted to increase the AUC of abemaciclib by up to 16-fold. In patients with recommended starting doses of 200 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily, reduce the Verzenio dose to 100 mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors other than ketoconazole. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily due to adverse reactions, further reduce the Verzenio dose to 50 mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors. If a patient taking Verzenio discontinues a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increase the Verzenio dose (after 3 to 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the inhibitor. With concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions and consider reducing the Verzenio dose in 50 mg decrements. Patients should avoid grapefruit products.

<b>Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers and consider alternative agents. </b>Coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers decreased the plasma concentrations of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites and may lead to reduced activity.

<b>With severe hepatic impairment</b> (Child-Pugh C), reduce the Verzenio dosing frequency to once daily. The pharmacokinetics of Verzenio in patients with <b>severe renal impairment</b> (CLcr &lt;30 mL/min), end stage renal disease, or in patients on dialysis <b>is unknown.</b> No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic (Child-Pugh A or B) and/or renal impairment (CLcr =30-89 mL/min).

Sanofi Canada is pleased to announce that Health Canada has approved SARCLISA<sup>® </sup>in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy.<sup>1</sup>
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><i>""The approval of this new SARCLISA<sup>®</sup> combination therapy gives HCPs another treatment option that can be integrated </i><i>at first relapse,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Scott Strong</span>, Oncology Franchise Head at Sanofi Genzyme Canada. ""Because most patients will experience a relapse at some point, it is important to deliver the best possible outcomes early in treatment courses. Every patient is unique, and this new indication means SARCLISA<sup>®</sup> has the potential to benefit a wide variety of Canadians living with multiple myeloma.""</i></p>
This approval marks the second indication for SARCLISA<sup>® </sup>in combination with a standard of care regimen for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory MM. Previously, SARCLISA<sup>®</sup> received Health Canada approval in combination with another standard of care regimen, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd), for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory MM who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. SARCLISA<sup>®</sup> is the first and only anti-CD38 antibody in combination with Pd to be approved in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>.<sup>1,4,5</sup>
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><i>""Patients in the IKEMA trial had a number of challenging characteristics, with almost one third being refractory to lenalidomide at study entry. Despite these obstacles, the addition of isatuximab to Kd resulted in a 47% reduction in the risk of disease progression and death, and the benefit was evident across all patient subgroups. These findings strengthen our confidence in isatuximab in the relapsed and refractory setting and demonstrate that isatuximab is becoming a standard of care in this environment.""<br class=""dnr"" /></i><b><span class=""xn-person"">Donna Reece</span>,</b> <b>MD, FRCPC<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Senior hematologist who cares for myeloma patients</p>
<b>Multiple Myeloma: An Incurable Cancer, Despite Available Treatments</b>

Despite available treatments, MM remains an incurable malignancy, and is associated with significant patient burden. Since MM does not have a cure, most patients will relapse. Relapsed MM is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory MM refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.<sup>6</sup>
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><i>""Triplet therapies are being used more frequently as we learn more about the most effective and safe treatment options for patients with multiple myeloma. Anti-CD38 antibodies like SARCLISA<sup>®</sup> have demonstrated a significant improvement in patient outcomes and continue to move into earlier lines of therapy. The availability of this second indication for SARCLISA<sup>®</sup> provides another therapeutic option for patients as early as their first relapse, which is a critical point in the treatment journey.""<br class=""dnr"" /></i><b><span class=""xn-person"">Martine Elias</span>, MSc<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Executive Director, Myeloma Canada</p>
<b>About the IKEMA Study</b>

This Health Canada approval was based on data from the Phase 3 IKEMA study, a randomized, multicentre, open-label clinical trial that enrolled 302 patients with relapsed MM across 69 centres spanning 16 countries.<sup>1,2</sup> The primary endpoint of IKEMA was progression-free survival (PFS).<sup>1</sup> Secondary endpoints of the IKEMA trial included overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) and very good partial response (VGPR).<sup>1,2</sup>

<b>About SARCLISA<sup>®</sup><br class=""dnr"" /></b>

SARCLISA<sup>®</sup> is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a <i>specific extracellular epitope of CD38 and triggers several mechanisms leading to the death of CD38-expressing tumour cells.</i><sup>1</sup> CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with ectoenzymatic activity, expressed in hematological malignancies, including MM cells, as well as other cell types and tissues at various levels.<sup>1</sup>

SARCLISA<sup>®</sup> continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies and solid tumours. The safety and efficacy of these additional uses have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority worldwide.

<div id=""blog-post-358787351582357071"" class=""blog-post"">
<div class=""blog-content"">
<div class=""paragraph"">PharmaTher Holdings Ltd. (the “Company” or “PharmaTher”) (OTCQB: PHRRF) (CSE: PHRM), a clinical-stage psychedelics biotech company, is pleased to announce that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation (ODD) for ketamine in the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare chronic pain and inflammatory condition following an injury to a limb (arm, leg, hand or foot).  This follows the FDA ODD grant of ketamine for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, announced by the Company on August 4, 2021.

Fabio Chianelli, Chief Executive Officer of PharmaTher, said, “Receiving our second FDA orphan drug designation with ketamine for CRPS continues our momentum in building a specialty ketamine-based product pipeline for not only mental health disorders, but also for rare and near-rare conditions present in neurological (Parkinson’s disease, ALS), pain and inflammatory disorders.  We expect to pursue a Phase 2 clinical study using our proprietary cGMP ketamine product in 2022 for CRPS.”

CRPS is a debilitating condition characterized by severe, continuous, burning or throbbing pain in a limb.  CRPS is known as one of the most painful disorders and the risk of suicide is significantly higher in patients with CRPS with one study demonstrating that 75% of patients had a high risk for suicide (Lee et al., Psychiatry Investig 2014;11(1):32-8).  CRPS has acute (recent, short-term) and chronic (lasting greater than six months) forms of excessive pain accompanied by changes in skin color, temperature and/or swelling, which results in loss of physical function and can lead to significant and sometimes permanent disability.  CRPS can occur after surgery or trauma, including brain or spinal cord injury.  There is currently no medication approved for the treatment of CRPS.

Ketamine acts as a noncompetitive, NMDA channel blocker that can prevent the induction of synaptic potentiation.  NMDA receptors play a central role in the processes of induction and maintenance of pain sensitization, accounting for the analgesic efficacy of ketamine.  Although ketamine has actions at other relevant sites, including nicotinic and opioid receptors, as well as, via monoamine reuptake transporters, it is likely that both the anesthetic and the analgesic actions of ketamine are largely mediated by NMDA receptor antagonism.  Likewise, the psychotropic and sympatho-excitatory side effects of ketamine are also predominantly mediated through NMDA receptor blockade.

The Orphan Drug Act grants special status to a drug or biological product to treat a rare disease or condition upon request of a sponsor. This status is referred to as orphan designation (or sometimes ""orphan status""). The FDA grants orphan status to products that treat rare diseases, providing incentives to sponsors developing drugs or biologics. The FDA defines rare diseases as those affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States at any given time. Orphan drug designation would qualify a drug for certain benefits and incentives, including seven years of marketing exclusivity if regulatory approval is ultimately received for the designated indication, potential tax credits for certain clinical drug testing costs, activities, eligibility for orphan drug grants, and the waiver of the FDA New Drug Application filing fee of approximately $2.4 million.

<p align=""left"">Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TPTX), a precision oncology company developing next-generation therapies that target genetic drivers of cancer, and EQRx, a new type of pharmaceutical company committed to developing and delivering important new medicines to patients at radically lower prices, today announced a clinical collaboration to evaluate elzovantinib (TPX-0022), Turning Point’s drug candidate targeting MET, SRC, and CSF1R, in combination with aumolertinib, EQRx’s drug candidate targeting EGFR, in patients with EGFR mutant MET-amplified advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p>
Under the terms of the agreement, Turning Point will sponsor and conduct a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination regimen and will assume all costs associated with the trial. EQRx will provide aumolertinib at no cost. Turning Point is targeting initiation of the clinical trial in 2022, pending filing of an investigational new drug (IND) application by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Preclinical data suggest the combination of MET and EGFR inhibition has the potential to increase anti-tumor activity based on complementary mechanisms. It is estimated that 15 to 20% of patients who progress on a first-line EGFR inhibitor develop MET amplification as the basis of acquired resistance.

“We believe the combination of elzovantinib with aumolertinib could provide an important potential treatment option for patients who develop MET amplification as acquired resistance to an EGFR inhibitor, where no approved therapies are available today,” said Athena Countouriotis, M.D., president and chief executive officer of Turning Point. “We are pleased to have EQRx as our collaboration partner and look forward to initiating our Phase 1b/2 SHIELD-2 study of the combination.”

“This collaboration marks the launch of the <em>EQRx-Inside Platform</em>, a unique development-to-commercialization platform designed to accelerate access to potentially life-enhancing combination therapies and create efficiencies for partners, physicians, and health systems,” said Melanie Nallicheri, chief executive officer of EQRx. “We are pleased to partner with Turning Point and believe this collaboration will be the first of many that will broaden patient access to important combination clinical trials and innovative potential cancer therapies such as aumolertinib and elzovantinib.”

<strong>About Elzovantinib</strong>
Elzovantinib is a multi-targeted orally bioavailable Type I TKI with a novel macrocyclic structure that potently inhibits MET, SRC and CSF1R, in preclinical assays. MET alterations, including point mutations, amplifications, fusions, exon 14 skipping, and the generation of HGF-MET autocrine loops have been reported in many cancers. SRC inhibition may have the potential to reduce or abolish certain oncogenic signaling, and the targeting of CSF1R leads to the modulation of tumor associated macrophages.

Preliminary clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 SHIELD-1 study of single-agent elzovantinib presented at the 2021 AACR-NCI-EORTC Conference in October 2021, demonstrated preliminary clinical activity, including objective responses across multiple tumor types and a generally tolerable safety profile. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted elzovantinib Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer, and Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with MET-amplified advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma after prior chemotherapy.

<strong>About Aumolertinib</strong>
Aumolertinib 110 mg once-daily is a prescription medicine approved in China as AMEILE<sup>®</sup> for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, as detected by a genomic test, who have progressed on or after prior EGFR TKI therapy. Aumolertinib is a novel, irreversible EGFR-TKI that selectively inhibits both EGFR sensitizing and resistance mutations with high selectivity over wild-type EGFR. Aumolertinib was approved in China in March 2020 based on the large single arm Phase 2 APOLLO study in second-line settings. The ongoing Phase 3 AENEAS trial in first-line settings met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival and topline results were presented at the 2021 ASCO Annual Meeting.

Hansoh Pharma and EQRx have partnered to expand global access to aumolertinib. EQRx holds the development and commercialization rights to aumolertinib outside of Greater China and is pursuing regulatory discussions in multiple countries.

<strong>About Turning Point Therapeutics Inc.</strong>
Turning Point Therapeutics is a clinical-stage precision oncology company with a pipeline of internally discovered investigational drugs designed to address key limitations of existing cancer therapies.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] =1)<b> </b>as determined by an FDA-approved test. The approval is based on the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-826 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy (paclitaxel plus cisplatin or paclitaxel plus carboplatin), with or without bevacizumab, compared to the same chemotherapy regimens, with or without bevacizumab.

In this patient population, KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, demonstrated superior overall survival (OS; HR=0.64 [95% CI, 0.50-0.81]; p=0.0001) and progression-free survival (PFS; HR=0.62 [95% CI, 0.50-0.77]; p&lt;0.0001) compared to chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS =1). Additionally, more patients responded to KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, than to chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 68% (95% CI, 62-74) versus 50% (95% CI, 44-56), respectively. Among patients who responded, the median duration of response (DOR) was 18.0 months (range, 1.3+ to 24.2+) for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, and 10.4 months (range, 1.5+ to 22.0+) for chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time during or after treatment with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatologic reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of KEYTRUDA. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or permanently discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.

“Cervical cancer more commonly affects younger women and certain women of color in the U.S., and unfortunately, women diagnosed with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer often have a low survival rate,” said Dr. Bradley Monk, oncologist with Arizona Oncology, medical director of U.S. Oncology Research Gynecology Program and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Arizona’s College of Medicine and Creighton University School of Medicine. “There have been no first-line approvals for women with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in the past seven years. I am excited for today’s approval of a new combination with KEYTRUDA, which offers a new treatment option for appropriate patients.”

“Today’s news is a meaningful step forward, as it offers a new therapeutic option for these patients and reinforces the role of KEYTRUDA in treating certain types of cervical cancers, with a second indication for the disease,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “The data showing a 36% reduction in the risk of death are compelling, and this approval brings an important new first-line treatment option to women with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS =1).”

Additionally, the FDA converted the accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA as a single agent for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS =1), as determined by an FDA-approved test, to a regular approval based on confirmatory data from KEYNOTE-826. This approval was originally granted in June 2018 based on results from the KEYNOTE-158 trial.

Merck is committed to delivering meaningful advances in women’s cancers. The company is rapidly expanding its extensive clinical development program for KEYTRUDA and several other investigational and approved medicines across gynecologic cancers, including researching KEYTRUDA for the treatment of other types of cervical cancer.

<strong>About KEYNOTE-826</strong>

The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-826 (ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03635567&amp;esheet=52508707&amp;newsitemid=20211013006053&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT03635567&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8bd5afdb58f4f5457f3a71765a86d381"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03635567</a>), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial that enrolled 617 patients with persistent, recurrent or first-line metastatic cervical cancer who had not been treated with chemotherapy except when used concurrently as a radio-sensitizing agent. Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression status. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by metastatic status at initial diagnosis, investigator decision to use bevacizumab and PD-L1 status (CPS &lt;1 vs. CPS 1 to &lt;10 vs. CPS =10). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment groups.

Patients in the KEYTRUDA arm received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks (Q3W) plus investigator’s choice of paclitaxel plus cisplatin or paclitaxel plus carboplatin Q3W, with or without bevacizumab Q3W. Patients in the placebo arm received placebo plus investigator’s choice of paclitaxel plus cisplatin or paclitaxel plus carboplatin Q3W, with or without bevacizumab Q3W. All study treatments were administered on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle. Cisplatin could be administered on Day 2 of each three-week treatment cycle. Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of KEYTRUDA was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed every nine weeks for the first year, followed by every twelve weeks thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by investigator review according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DOR, according to RECIST v1.1, as assessed by investigator review.

Of the 617 enrolled patients, 548 patients (89%) had tumors expressing PD-L1 with a CPS =1. Among these 548 enrolled patients with tumors expressing PD-L1, 273 patients were randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, and 275 patients were randomized to placebo in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab. Sixty-three percent of the 548 patients received bevacizumab as part of study treatment. At study entry, 21% of patients had metastatic disease only, and 79% had persistent or recurrent disease, with or without distant metastases, of whom 39% had received prior chemoradiation only, and 17% had received prior chemoradiation plus surgery.

The key efficacy results for patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 (CPS =1) are summarized below:

<b>About Cervical Cancer</b>

Cervical cancer forms in the cells lining the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus. While screenings and prevention have resulted in declining cervical cancer rates, the disease continues to affect many people in the U.S. and around the world. Cervical cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. It is estimated there were more than 604,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and nearly 342,000 deaths resulting from the disease in 2020 globally. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be nearly 14,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,300 deaths resulting from the disease in 2021. For patients in the U.S. who are diagnosed with cervical cancer, the five-year relative survival rate is 66.3%. For patients diagnosed with cervical cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body, this drops to 17.6%.

<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong>

KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.

Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated the type-II variation application for Beovu<sup>®</sup> (brolucizumab) 6 mg for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). Additionally, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) accepted an application for Beovu in the treatment of DME. Regulatory decisions for Beovu in DME are expected in mid-2022 for the US and Europe.

If approved, DME would be the second indication for Beovu following its approval for wet age-related macular degeneration in October 2019 (FDA) and February 2020 (European Commission)<sup>5,6</sup>. DME is the leading cause of blindness in adults in developed countries, affecting 12% of people with type 1 diabetes and 28% of those with type 2 diabetes<sup>1</sup>. Consistently high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage small blood vessels in the eye, causing them to leak fluid<sup>1</sup>. Unmet needs in DME include improving fluid resolution and addressing the burden of frequent treatment schedules<sup>1-3</sup>.

“People living with diabetes often need to manage multiple comorbidities related to diabetes and there is a significant need to provide better disease management. If approved, Beovu has the potential to provide better fluid resolution and fewer injections during the loading phase and throughout maintenance treatment,” said Jill Hopkins, SVP and Global Development Unit Head, Ophthalmology, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “We look forward to bringing this potential new treatment option that may help to address unmet needs in the DME patient population.”

The regulatory applications are based on year one data from the Phase III, randomized, double-masked KESTREL and KITE* studies, which met their primary endpoint of non-inferiority in change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline versus aflibercept at year one<sup>4</sup>. In KESTREL and KITE, following the loading phase, over half of patients in the Beovu 6 mg arm remained on a 12-week dosing interval through year one<sup>4</sup>. Fewer eyes treated with Beovu had intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid (IRF/SRF) at week 32 and week 52 versus eyes treated with aflibercept<sup>4</sup>. The KESTREL and KITE trials are the first pivotal trials to assess an anti-VEGF treatment on six-week dosing intervals in the loading phase, suggesting Beovu may offer fewer injections from the start of treatment<sup>4</sup>.

Overall, Beovu demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile in KESTREL and KITE<sup>4</sup>. The most common ocular and non-ocular adverse events (=5%) in KESTREL and KITE were conjunctival hemorrhage, nasopharyngitis and hypertension<sup>4</sup>. IOI rates in KESTREL were 4.7% for brolucizumab 3 mg (including 1.6% retinal vasculitis), 3.7% for Beovu 6 mg (including 0.5% retinal vasculitis), and 0.5% for aflibercept 2 mg<sup>4</sup>. IOI rates in KITE were equivalent (1.7%) between the Beovu 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg arms with no retinal vasculitis reported<sup>4</sup>. Retinal vascular occlusion was reported in KESTREL for brolucizumab 3 mg (1.1%) and 6 mg (0.5%), and in KITE for brolucizumab and aflibercept (0.6% each)<sup>4</sup>. The majority of these events were manageable and resolved with or without treatment<sup>4</sup>.

Novartis remains committed to bringing Beovu to the patients who may benefit most from this important medicine.

<strong>About the KESTREL and KITE clinical trials</strong>
KESTREL and KITE are global, randomized, double-masked, Phase III, two-year studies comparing the safety and efficacy of Beovu and aflibercept in the treatment of DME<sup>4,7,</sup><sup>8</sup>.

KESTREL and KITE involved 926 patients in 36 countries<sup>7,8</sup>. In the loading phase of both trials, patients in the Beovu arms were treated every six weeks for a total of five doses; patients in the aflibercept arms were treated every four weeks for a total of five doses, in line with its label at the start of the studies<sup>7.8</sup>. Following the loading phase, patients in the Beovu arms were subsequently treated every 12 weeks, with those demonstrating disease activity moved to dosing every eight weeks for the remainder of the study<sup>7,8</sup>.

At week 72 of KITE, Beovu patients dosed every 12 weeks could be extended to dosing every 16 weeks, and patients dosed every eight weeks could be extended to every 12 weeks<sup>8</sup>. As in year one, those demonstrating disease activity were moved to dosing every eight weeks for the remainder of the study<sup>8</sup>. Through the entirety of both two-year trials, patients in the aflibercept arms were treated every eight weeks<sup>7,8</sup>.

<strong>About diabetic macular edema (DME)</strong>
DME is a common microvascular complication in patients with diabetes that may have a debilitating impact on visual acuity, eventually leading to blindness<sup>1</sup>. DME is the leading cause of blindness in adults in developed countries, affecting 12% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 28% of those with type 2 diabetes<sup>1</sup>.

Consistently high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage small blood vessels in the eye, causing them to leak fluid<sup>1</sup>. This damage leads to an excess of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)<sup>1,</sup><sup>9</sup>. VEGF is a protein that stimulates the growth of blood vessels<sup>1,9</sup>. At elevated levels in DME, VEGF stimulates the growth of abnormal, leaky blood vessels<sup>1,9</sup>. The resulting accumulation of fluid (known as edema) in the macula can lead to vision loss<sup>1,9</sup>. The macula is the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision<sup>9</sup>. Early symptoms of DME include blurry or wavy central vision and distorted color perception, although the disease can also progress without symptoms at early stages<sup>9,10</sup>.

<strong>About Beovu (brolucizumab) 6 mg</strong>
Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) 6 mg is approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in more than 70 countries, including in the US, EU, UK, Japan, Canada and Australia<sup>5,6,11-13</sup>. Additional trials, which study the effects of brolucizumab in patients with wet AMD, diabetic macular edema (DME), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), are currently ongoing.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <b>REGN</b>) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review a Biologics License Application (BLA) for REGEN-COV<sup>® </sup>(casirivimab and imdevimab) to treat COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients and as prophylaxis in certain individuals. The FDA has assigned a target action date of April 13, 2022 and informed us that they currently are planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application in advance of that date.

The BLA is supported by two positive Phase 3 trials involving more than 6,000 patients that evaluated the efficacy and safety of REGEN-COV to treat <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323077-1&amp;h=296511232&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2108163&amp;a=non-hospitalized"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">non-hospitalized</a> patients already infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to prevent symptomatic infection in asymptomatic household contacts of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (both <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323077-1&amp;h=1893070563&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2109682&amp;a=uninfected"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">uninfected</a> and <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323077-1&amp;h=63789323&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fphase-3-treatment-trial-recently-infected-asymptomatic-patients&amp;a=infected"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">infected</a> contacts). A second BLA submission focusing on the treatment of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is expected to be submitted later this year.

Regulatory submissions are also progressing in the European Union (EU). Earlier this week, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323077-1&amp;h=2071071415&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ema.europa.eu%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fema-receives-application-marketing-authorisation-ronapreve-casirivimab-imdevimab-treatment&amp;a=accepted"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">accepted</a> for review the Marketing Authorization Application for the same antibody cocktail, known as Ronapreve™ in the EU and other countries outside of the U.S., for use in certain people either as a treatment in infected non-hospitalized patients, or as prophylaxis.

<b>About the REGEN-COV Antibody Cocktail</b>
REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies that was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, using Regeneron's proprietary <i>VelocImmune<sup>®</sup></i> and <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup></i> technologies. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that form the cocktail bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus's spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in <i><u><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323077-1&amp;h=185014799&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell%2Ffulltext%2FS0092-8674(21)00703-0&amp;a=Cell"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Cell</a></u></i> and <i><u><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323077-1&amp;h=3231227977&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.science.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1126%2Fscience.abd0831&amp;a=Science"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Science</a></u></i>.

Multiple analyses have shown that the antibody cocktail retains potency against the main variants of concern, including Delta (first identified in India), Gamma (first identified in Brazil), Beta (first identified in South Africa) and Mu (first identified in Colombia), with information available in the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323077-1&amp;h=1021126216&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.regeneron.com%2Fdownloads%2Ftreatment-covid19-eua-fact-sheet-for-hcp.pdf&amp;a=Fact+Sheet+for+Healthcare+Providers"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers</a>. Regeneron will continue actively monitoring the potency of REGEN-COV against emerging variants.

REGEN-COV has not been approved by the FDA, but is currently <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323077-1&amp;h=1377434215&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3248768-1%26h%3D3509491638%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.regeneron.com%252Fdownloads%252Ftreatment-covid19-eua-fact-sheet-for-hcp.pdf%26a%3Dauthorized&amp;a=authorized"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">authorized</a> for emergency use for the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis in certain high risk individuals. Post-exposure prophylaxis with REGEN-COV is not a substitute for vaccination against COVID-19. REGEN-COV is not authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19 or for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy, or for people currently using chronic oxygen therapy because of an underlying comorbidity who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19. This authorization is for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency uses under section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. Additional information about REGEN-COV in the U.S. is below (authorized uses and important safety information).

REGEN-COV is an investigational medicine that has emergency or temporary pandemic authorizations currently in place in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., several countries in the EU, India, Switzerland and Canada, and the antibody cocktail is fully approved in Japan and conditionally approved in the UK.

<b>About Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune</i> Technology</b>
Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune</i> technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323077-1&amp;h=2055507045&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2F0168952585900897&amp;a=envision"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">envision</a> making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing <i>VelocImmune</i> and related <i>VelociSuite</i> technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used <i>VelocImmune</i> technology to create approximately a quarter of all original, FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN–COV<sup>® </sup>(casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab), Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab), Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), Evkeeza<sup>®</sup> (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).

Some of these events required hospitalization. It is not known if these events were related to REGEN-COV use or were due to progression of COVID-19</li>
 	<li><b>Limitations of Benefit and Potential for Risk in Patients with Severe COVID-19:</b> Monoclonal antibodies, such as REGEN-COV, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Therefore, REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19–related comorbidity</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b><u>Adverse Reactions</u></b><b>:</b>
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li><b>COV-2067 (Treatment): </b>Infusion-related reactions (adverse event assessed as causally related by the investigator) of grade 2 or higher severity have been observed in 10/4,206 (0.2%) of those who received REGEN-COV at the authorized dose or a higher dose. Three subjects receiving the 8,000 mg dose of REGEN-COV, and one subject receiving the 1,200 mg casirivimab and 1,200 mg imdevimab, had infusion-related reactions (urticaria, pruritus, flushing, pyrexia, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, rash) which resulted in permanent discontinuation of the infusion. All events resolved. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in the clinical program in subjects receiving REGEN-COV. The events began within 1 hour of completion of the infusion, and in at least one case required treatment including epinephrine. The events resolved</li>
 	<li><b>COV-2069 (Post-exposure prophylaxis):</b> In subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline (Cohort A), injection site reactions (all grade 1 and 2) occurred in 55 subjects (4%) in the REGEN-COV group and 19 subjects (2%) in the placebo group. The most common signs and symptoms of injection site reactions which occurred in at least 1% of subjects in the REGEN-COV group were erythema and pruritus. Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 2 subjects (0.2%) in the REGEN-COV group and all hypersensitivity reactions were grade 1 in severity. In subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline (Cohort B), injection site reactions, all of which were grade 1 or 2, occurred in 6 subjects (4%) in the REGEN-COV group and 1 subject (1%) in the placebo group. The most common signs and symptoms of injection site reactions which occurred in at least 1% of subjects in the REGEN-COV group were ecchymosis and erythema</li>
 	<li><b>COV-2093 (Subcutaneous Dosing):</b> Injection site reactions occurred in 12% and 4% of subjects following single dose administration in the REGEN-COV and placebo groups, respectively. Remaining safety finding following subcutaneous administration in the REGEN-COV group were similar to the safety findings observed with intravenous administration in COV-2067. With repeat dosing, injection site reactions occurred in 252 subjects (35%) in the REGEN-COV group and 38 subjects (16%) in the placebo group; all injection site reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 8 subjects (1%) in the REGEN-COV group; and all hypersensitivity reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity. There were no cases of anaphylaxis</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b><u>Patient Monitoring Recommendations</u></b>: Clinically monitor patients during dose administration and observe patients for at least 1 hour after intravenous infusion or subcutaneous dosing is complete</li>
 	<li><b><u>Use in Specific Populations</u></b><b>:</b>
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li><b>Pregnancy:</b> There are insufficient data to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. REGEN-COV should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus</li>
 	<li><b>Lactation:</b> There are no available data on the presence of casirivimab and/or imdevimab in human milk or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for REGEN-COV and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from REGEN-COV or from the underlying maternal condition</li>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Asieris Pharmaceuticals (Asieris) today announced that the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) NMPA has approved the Investigational New Drug (IND) application of oral APL-1202 in combination with BeiGene’s tislelizumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). This IND was already cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June.

This is an open-label, multi-center Phase I/II clinical study with the following objectives: to evaluate the safety in MIBC patients; to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to assess efficacy as neoadjuvant therapy for MIBC.

APL-1202 is an orally available reversible MetAP2 Inhibitor with anti-angiogenic, anti-tumor activities and can also modulate tumor immune microenvironment. It is currently in Phase III/pivotal clinical trials in China, either as single agent as first-line treatment for patients with intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), or in combination with a chemotherapy as second-line treatment in patients with intermediate and high-risk chemo-refractory NMIBC. Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc?R on macrophages. The China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved tislelizumab in five indications, including full approval for first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy and for first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy. NMPA also granted conditional approval for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL) who received at least two prior therapies, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with PD-L1 high expression whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy, and for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received at least one systemic therapy. Full approval for these indications is contingent upon results from ongoing randomized, controlled confirmatory clinical trials.

According to the 2020 Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Urothelial Carcinoma, the Level I recommendation for MIBC is that patients who tolerate cisplatin undergo radical cystectomy (RC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The commonly used chemotherapy regimen is gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC). However, cisplatin can cause serious side effects such as renal dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, and bone marrow suppression, and some patients are intolerant. For these patients no preoperative/neoadjuvant therapy is available that can bring survival benefits.

“We are pleased with the IND approval by the CDE, following the earlier clearance in the US. We are looking forward to testing its efficacy and safety in clinical trials.” said Dr. Xue Yong, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer at Asieris. “Asieris will continue to devote itself to exploring and developing safer and more effective therapeutic so as to meet the unfulfilled clinical needs and provide more treatment options for patients.”

<span class=""xn-location"">INDIANAPOLIS</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Oct. 14, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lilly-announces-updated-verzenio-abemaciclib-phase-3-monarche-trial-data-presented-at-esmo-virtual-plenary-and-simultaneously-published-in-the-annals-of-oncology-301400654.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">LLY</a>) today announced updated data from the positive Phase 3 monarchE trial evaluating the investigational use of Verzenio<sup>®</sup> (abemaciclib) in combination with standard adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-), node-positive, high risk early breast cancer (EBC). These data were presented at today's ESMO Virtual Plenary and simultaneously published in the <i><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323519-1&amp;h=989088779&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.annalsofoncology.org%2Farticle%2FS0923-7534(21)04494-X%2Ffulltext&amp;a=Annals+of+Oncology"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Annals of Oncology</a></i>.

As previously published in the <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i>,<sup>1</sup> monarchE met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population for patients treated with adjuvant Verzenio plus ET compared to those treated with ET alone. Consistent with expert guidelines, IDFS was defined as the length of time before breast cancer comes back, any new cancer develops, or death.

The trial included women and men with HR+ HER2-, node-positive EBC who had a high risk of disease recurrence based on clinical and pathological features (N=5,637). Patients were assigned to one of two cohorts. Cohort 1 enrolled patients with =4 positive axillary lymph nodes (ALN), or 1-3 positive ALN and either Grade 3 disease or tumor size =5 cm. Cohort 2 enrolled patients with 1-3 positive ALN and centrally determined Ki-67 score of =20% (defined in the study as ""Ki-67 high""). Ki-67 is a marker of cellular proliferation. Ki-67 score was also determined centrally in Cohort 1 patients with a suitable sample, but Ki-67 determination was not required for enrollment in this cohort. The ITT population included both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.

Data in today's presentation and publication include updated results reflecting median follow-up of 27 months. In the updated analysis, the benefit of Verzenio on IDFS and distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) was maintained (Table 1 below). At three years, the absolute improvement rates in IDFS and DRFS were 5.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Exploratory piecewise analyses of the IDFS and DRFS hazard ratio (HR) estimates within each year were also conducted, which demonstrated increasing magnitude of IDFS effect size over time: from the first year (0-1yr HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.03) to the second year (1-2yr HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.87), and strengthened beyond the two-year study treatment period (2+yr HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.86). Similarly, the DRFS HR estimates strengthened from the first year (0-1yr HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.99) to the second year (1-2yr HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.88), and persisted beyond the two-year study treatment period (2+yr HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.45, 1.03). The impact of Ki-67 score on prognosis and likelihood of benefit from Verzenio was also analyzed. As expected, a high Ki-67 score of =20% was prognostic of increased recurrence risk among patients with high-risk clinical and pathological features. However, Verzenio conferred consistent benefit in reducing risk of recurrence regardless of having a low (&lt;20%) or high (=20%) Ki-67 score among patients with high-risk clinical and pathological features (Table 2 below). With 90 percent of patients now having completed the two-year treatment period or discontinued early, safety data are considered mature and remain consistent with the known profile of Verzenio. All patients in monarchE will continue to be followed to assess overall survival and other endpoints. Overall survival data were not yet mature.

""The results from monarchE are truly impressive and we are encouraged by the consistency of the treatment benefit and increasing magnitude of effect observed over time in reducing the risk of recurrence and development of metastatic disease,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Joyce A. O'Shaughnessy</span>, M.D., Celebrating Women Chair in Breast Cancer Research, <span class=""xn-org"">Baylor University</span> Medical <span class=""xn-location"">Center, Texas</span> Oncology, US Oncology, <span class=""xn-location"">Dallas Texas</span>, monarchE investigator and presenter at today's ESMO Virtual Plenary. ""These data suggest that the addition of adjuvant Verzenio to endocrine therapy in the high risk early breast cancer setting has the potential to change the way we treat these patients and may address a significant unmet need for those with clinical and pathological risk features who are in need of new treatment options.""

The following table shows the evolution of IDFS and DRFS data in the ITT population.

""We are extremely pleased with the consistency of the landmark results from monarchE and are excited to see these important data shared with the breast cancer community,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">David Hyman</span>, M.D., chief medical officer, oncology at Lilly. ""Verzenio treatment benefit observed at the primary outcome analysis was maintained with 27 months of median follow-up, including beyond the Verzenio treatment period, reinforcing our confidence in the observed treatment effect.""

Adverse reactions from monarchE were consistent with the known safety profile for Verzenio.<sup>1</sup> A higher incidence of Grade =3 adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events was observed with Verzenio plus ET compared to ET alone (50% vs. 16% and 15% vs. 9%, respectively). The most frequent AEs were diarrhea, neutropenia, and fatigue in the Verzenio plus ET arm, and arthralgia, hot flush, and fatigue in the ET alone arm.

<b>About the monarchE Study</b><br class=""dnr"" /><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3323519-1&amp;h=2591310678&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03155997&amp;a=monarchE"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">monarchE</a> is a global, randomized, open-label, two cohort, multicenter Phase 3 study in adult women and men with HR+ HER2-, node-positive resected EBC with clinical and pathological features consistent with a high risk of disease recurrence. A total of 5,637 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive two years of Verzenio 150 mg twice daily plus physician's choice of standard endocrine therapy, or standard endocrine therapy alone. Patients in both treatment arms were instructed to continue to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy for up to 5-10 years as recommended by their clinician. Cohort 1 enrolled patients with =4 positive axillary lymph nodes (ALN), or 1-3 positive ALN and either Grade 3 disease or tumor size =5 cm. Cohort 2 enrolled patients with 1-3 positive ALN and centrally determined Ki-67 score of =20%. The primary endpoint was IDFS in the ITT population (Cohorts 1 &amp; 2). Secondary endpoints were IDFS in patients with high Ki-67 score (in the ITT population and in the Cohort 1 population), DRFS, overall survival, and safety.<sup>1,2</sup>

<b>About Early Breast Cancer and Risk of Recurrence<br class=""dnr"" /></b>It is estimated that 90 percent of all breast cancers are detected at an early stage. Although the prognosis for HR+ HER2- EBC is generally positive, 20 percent of patients will experience recurrence potentially to incurable metastatic disease.<sup>3</sup> Risk of recurrence is greatest within the initial two to three years post-diagnosis, particularly in patients with node-positive, high risk EBC.<sup>4</sup> Factors associated with high risk of recurrence include: positive nodal status, large tumor size (=5 cm), high tumor grade (Grade 3), and high rate of cellular proliferation [Ki-67 score (=20%)].<sup>2</sup>

Node-positive means that cancer cells from the tumor in the breast have been found in the lymph nodes in the armpit area. Although the breast cancer is removed through surgery, the presence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes signifies that there is a higher chance of the cancer returning and spreading.

<b>About Breast Cancer<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Breast cancer has now surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, according to GLOBOCAN. The estimated 2.3 million new cases indicate that 1 in every 8 cancers diagnosed in 2020 is breast cancer. With approximately 685,000 deaths in 2020, breast cancer is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death worldwide.<sup>5</sup> In the U.S., it is estimated that there will be 281,550 new cases of breast cancer in 2021.<sup>6</sup>

Approximately 70 percent of all breast cancers are of the HR+ HER2- subtype.<sup>6</sup>

<b>About Verzenio® (abemaciclib)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Verzenio<sup>®</sup> abemaciclib is a targeted treatment known as a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Verzenio is a non-chemotherapy oral tablet.

Verzenio works inside the cell to block CDK4/6 activity and help stop the growth of cancer cells, so they may eventually die (based on preclinical studies).* Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)4/6 are activated by binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation.

In vitro, continuous exposure to Verzenio inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis (cell death). Preclinically, Verzenio dosed daily without interruption resulted in reduction of tumor size. Inhibiting CDK4/6 in healthy cells can result in side effects, some of which may be serious. Clinical evidence also suggests that Verzenio crosses the blood-brain barrier. In patients with advanced cancer, including breast cancer, concentrations of Verzenio and its active metabolites (M2 and M20) in cerebrospinal fluid are comparable to unbound plasma concentrations.

Verzenio is Lilly's first solid oral dosage form to be made using a faster, more efficient process known as continuous manufacturing. Continuous manufacturing is a new and advanced type of manufacturing within the pharmaceutical industry, and Lilly is one of the first companies to use this technology.

<b>INDICATIONS FOR VERZENIO</b>

Verzenio<sup>®</sup> (abemaciclib) in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-), node-positive, early breast cancer (EBC) at high risk of recurrence and a Ki-67 score of =20% as determined by an FDA-approved test.

Verzenio is indicated for the treatment of HR+ HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer:
<ul>
 	<li>in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women, and men, as initial endocrine-based therapy</li>
 	<li>in combination with fulvestrant for adult patients with disease progression following endocrine therapy</li>
 	<li>as a single agent for adult patients with disease progression following endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting</li>
</ul>
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR VERZENIO (abemaciclib)</b>

Severe <b>diarrhea</b> associated with dehydration and infection occurred in patients treated with Verzenio.<b> </b>Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients<b>, </b>diarrhea<b> </b>occurred in 81 to 90% of patients who received Verzenio. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 8 to 20% of patients receiving Verzenio. Most patients experienced diarrhea during the first month of Verzenio treatment. The median time to onset of the first diarrhea event ranged from 6 to 8 days; and the median duration of Grade 2 and Grade 3 diarrhea ranged from 6 to 11 days and 5 to 8 days, respectively. Across trials, 19 to 26% of patients with diarrhea required a Verzenio dose interruption and 13 to 23% required a dose reduction.

Instruct patients to start antidiarrheal therapy, such as loperamide, at the first sign of loose stools, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider for further instructions and appropriate follow-up. For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, discontinue Verzenio until toxicity resolves to =Grade 1, and then resume Verzenio at the next lower dose.

<b>Neutropenia</b>, including febrile neutropenia and fatal neutropenic sepsis, occurred in patients treated with Verzenio. Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, neutropenia occurred in 37 to 46% of patients receiving Verzenio. A Grade =3 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) occurred in 19 to 32% of patients receiving Verzenio. Across trials, the median time to first episode of Grade =3 neutropenia ranged from 29 to 33 days, and the median duration of Grade =3 neutropenia ranged from 11 to 16 days. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in &lt;1% of patients exposed to Verzenio across trials.  Two deaths due to neutropenic sepsis were observed in MONARCH 2. Inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever to their healthcare provider.

Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of Verzenio therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.

Severe, life-threatening, or fatal <b>interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis</b> can occur in patients treated with Verzenio and other CDK4/6 inhibitors. In Verzenio-treated patients in EBC (monarchE), 3% of patients experienced ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.4% were Grade 3 or 4 and there was one fatality (0.1%). In Verzenio-treated patients in MBC (MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), 3.3% of Verzenio-treated patients had ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.6% had Grade 3 or 4, and 0.4% had fatal outcomes. Additional cases of ILD or pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported.

Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis. Symptoms may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for such symptoms should be excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Dose interruption or dose reduction is recommended in patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 ILD or pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue Verzenio in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis.

<b>Grade =3 increases in</b> <b>alanine aminotransferase (</b><b>ALT) </b>(2 to 6%) and <b>aspartate aminotransferase (</b><b>AST) </b>(2 to 3%) were reported in patients receiving Verzenio. Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), the median time to onset of Grade =3 ALT increases ranged from 57 to 87 days and the median time to resolution to Grade &lt;3 was 13 to 14 days. The median time to onset of Grade =3 AST increases ranged from 71 to 185 days and the median time to resolution to Grade &lt;3 ranged from 11 to 15 days.

Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) prior to the start of Verzenio therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2, or any Grade 3 or 4 hepatic transaminase elevation.

<b>Venous thromboembolic events (VTE)</b> were reported in 2 to 5% of patients across three clinical trials in 3559 patients treated with Verzenio (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3). VTE included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pelvic venous thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis, and inferior vena cava thrombosis. In clinical trials, deaths due to VTE have been reported in patients treated with Verzenio.

Verzenio has not been studied in patients with early breast cancer who had a history of VTE. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. Dose interruption is recommended for EBC patients with any grade VTE and for MBC patients with a Grade 3 or 4 VTE.

Verzenio can cause <b>fetal harm</b> when administered to a pregnant woman, based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Verzenio and for 3 weeks after the last dose. Based on findings in animals, Verzenio may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. There are no data on the presence of Verzenio in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during Verzenio treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.

Positive high-level results from the HIMALAYA Phase III trial showed a single, high priming dose of tremelimumab added to <i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) benefit versus sorafenib as a 1st-line treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had not received prior systemic therapy and were not eligible for localised treatment. This novel dose and schedule of tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 antibody, and <i>Imfinzi</i> is called the STRIDE regimen (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab). The combination demonstrated a favourable safety profile, and the addition of tremelimumab to <i>Imfinzi</i> did not increase severe hepatic toxicity.

<i>Imfinzi </i>alone demonstrated non-inferior OS to sorafenib with a numerical trend in favour of <i>Imfinzi</i> and an improved tolerability profile compared to sorafenib.

Liver cancer, of which HCC is the most common type, is the third leading cause of cancer death and the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide with approximately 900,000 people diagnosed each year.<sup>1-2</sup> Only 7% of patients with advanced disease survive five years.<sup>3</sup>

Ghassan Abou-Alfa, MD, MBA, Attending Physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and principal investigator in the HIMALAYA Phase III trial, said: “HIMALAYA is the first Phase III trial to add a novel single priming dose of an anti-CTLA4 antibody to another checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab. This serves to boost the patient’s own immune system against their liver cancer, aiming to maximise long-term survival with minimal side effects. This is very exciting news for our patients.”

Susan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, AstraZeneca, said: “Inhibition of CTLA-4 has shown the ability to drive benefit particularly in the tail of the survival curve in several settings. This is the first time a dual immunotherapy regimen has improved overall survival as a 1st-line treatment for patients with unresectable liver cancer for whom treatment options are limited and long-term outcomes are poor.”

The data from the HIMALAYA Phase III trial will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

<i>Imfinzi</i> and tremelimumab were granted Orphan Drug Designations in the US for the treatment of HCC in 2020. Tremelimumab was also granted orphan designation in the EU in HCC in 2020.

<b><u>Notes</u></b>

<b>Liver cancer
</b>About 75% of all primary liver cancers are HCC.<sup>1</sup> Between 80-90% of all patients with HCC also have cirrhosis, which is primarily caused by infection with the hepatitis B or C viruses.<sup>4</sup> Chronic liver diseases are associated with inflammation that, over time, results in immunosuppression and can lead to the development of HCC.<sup>4,5</sup>

The unique immune environment of liver cancer provides clear rationale for researching medicines that harness the power of the immune system to treat HCC.<sup>6</sup> A critical unmet need exists for patients with HCC who face limited treatment options.<sup>6 </sup>More than half of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, often when symptoms first appear.<sup>6</sup>

<b>HIMALAYA
</b>HIMALAYA was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, global Phase III trial of <i>Imfinzi</i> monotherapy and the STRIDE regimen, comprising a single priming dose of tremelimumab 300mg added to <i>Imfinzi</i> 1500mg followed by <i>Imfinzi</i> every four weeks versus sorafenib, a standard-of-care multi-kinase inhibitor, in a total of 1,324 patients with unresectable, advanced HCC who had not been treated with prior systemic therapy and were not eligible for locoregional therapy (treatment localised to the liver and surrounding tissue).

The trial was conducted in 190 centres across 16 countries, including in the US, Canada, Europe, South America and Asia. The primary endpoint was OS for STRIDE versus sorafenib and key secondary endpoints included OS for <i>Imfinzi </i>versus sorafenib, objective response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) for STRIDE and for <i>Imfinzi </i>alone.

<b><i>Imfinzi
</i></b><i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-L1 protein and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 and CD80 proteins, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

<i>Imfinzi</i> is the only approved immunotherapy in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients whose disease has not progressed after chemoradiation therapy and is the global standard of care in this setting based on the PACIFIC Phase III trial.

<i>Imfinzi</i> is also approved in the US, EU, Japan, China and many other countries around the world for the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) based on the CASPIAN Phase III trial.

<i>Imfinzi</i> is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in several countries. Since the first approval in May 2017, more than 100,000 patients have been treated with <i>Imfinzi</i>.

In 1st-line Stage IV NSCLC, positive results from the POSEIDON Phase III trial showed <i>Imfinzi</i> plus chemotherapy with a short course of tremelimumab 75mg demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS and PFS compared to chemotherapy.

As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi</i> is being tested as a single treatment and in combinations with other anti-cancer treatments for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, HCC, biliary tract cancer (BTC), oesophageal cancer, gastric and gastroesophageal cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and other solid tumours.

<b>Tremelimumab
</b>Tremelimumab is a human monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine that targets the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T-cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death.

Tremelimumab is being tested in a clinical trial programme in combination with <i>Imfinzi</i> in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer and liver cancer.

<b>AstraZeneca in gastrointestinal cancers
</b>AstraZeneca has a broad development programme for the treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers across several medicines spanning a variety of tumour types and stages of disease. In 2020, GI cancers collectively represented approximately 5.1 million new diagnoses leading to approximately 3.6 million deaths.<sup>7</sup>

Within this programme, the Company is committed to improving outcomes in gastric, liver, biliary tract, oesophageal, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers.

<i>Imfinzi </i>(durvalumab) is being assessed in combinations including with tremelimumab in HCC, BTC, oesophageal and gastric cancers in an extensive development programme spanning early to late-stage disease across settings.

The Company aims to understand the potential of <i>Enhertu </i>(trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate,<i> </i>in the two most common GI cancers, colorectal and gastric cancers.<sup>2</sup> <i>Enhertu</i> is jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo.

<i>Lynparza </i>(olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor with a broad and advanced clinical trial programme across multiple GI tumour types including pancreatic and colorectal cancers. <i>Lynparza </i>is developed and commercialised in collaboration with MSD (Merck &amp; Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada).

<b>AstraZeneca in immunotherapy
</b>Immunotherapy is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s Immuno-Oncology (IO) portfolio is anchored in immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression.

AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical trial programme that includes <i>Imfinzi</i> as a single treatment and in combination with tremelimumab and other novel antibodies in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of treatment, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient.

In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small, targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

<b>AstraZeneca in oncology
</b>AstraZeneca is leading a revolution in oncology with the ambition to provide cures for cancer in every form, following the science to understand cancer and all its complexities to discover, develop and deliver life-changing medicines to patients.

The Company’s focus is on some of the most challenging cancers. It is through persistent innovation that AstraZeneca has built one of the most diverse portfolios and pipelines in the industry, with the potential to catalyse changes in the practice of medicine and transform the patient experience.

AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer care and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

--Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX), a global leader in women's health, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Bolder Surgical, a privately held, U.S.-based company that provides advanced energy vessel sealing surgical devices, for approximately $160 million, subject to working capital and other customary closing adjustments.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">Hologic to Acquire Bolder Surgical for $160 Million, Expanding its Surgical Franchise</p>

<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211014005994/en/Hologic-to-Acquire-Bolder-Surgical-for-160-Million-Expanding-its-Surgical-Franchise#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
“This acquisition will broaden our growing Surgical portfolio by adding Bolder’s differentiated advanced vessel sealing and dissection tools that are used in laparoscopic procedures,” said Essex Mitchell, Hologic’s Division President, Surgical. “We can accelerate growth and improve patient outcomes by leveraging our significant commercial resources and strong relationships with OB/GYNs.”

The transaction adds laparoscopic vessel sealing, dividing and dissecting devices to the Hologic portfolio and also will enable Hologic to expand the use of Bolder’s devices to OB/GYN specialists. Hologic estimates that there are five times more laparoscopic procedures in OB/GYN applications than in pediatrics, where Bolder focuses today. Bolder’s CoolSeal<sup>®</sup> devices feature slender, dual action jaws, allowing for dissection, vessel sealing and dividing all in one device. The ability to use a combination device improves surgical efficiency by reducing the need for instrument exchanges. In addition, Bolder’s JustRight<sup>®</sup> 3 mm vessel sealer and the JustRight 5 mm stapler are designed for small surgical spaces such as in pediatric cases, which can help reduce the need for larger, overpowered instruments.

“Becoming part of Hologic and its highly respected and well-known Surgical business is an exciting and pivotal junction for Bolder,” said Robert Kline, Bolder Surgical’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Together, we will accelerate realizing Bolder’s vision to increase the efficiency of both surgeons and hospitals. Joining Hologic, with its similar mission, culture, and world-class portfolio of products, is an ideal fit for Bolder.”

The complementary acquisition of Bolder Surgical will add to Hologic’s surgical product line, which includes the NovaSure<sup>®</sup> endometrial ablation system for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding, the MyoSure<sup>®</sup> tissue removal devices for the treatment of intrauterine fibroids and polyps, the Acessa<sup>®</sup> laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation system for the treatment of fibroids, and the Fluent<sup>® </sup>fluid management system for streamlining hysteroscopic procedures.

“This acquisition is another good example of our capital deployment strategy, as we use our strong cash flow to add products that leverage our existing channel strength and accelerate our growth,” said Steve MacMillan, Hologic’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Bolder Surgical is expected to generate approximately $10 million of product revenue this calendar year. The acquisition is expected to be slightly dilutive to Hologic’s non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2022, roughly break-even in fiscal 2023, and accretive thereafter.

The acquisition is expected to close by the end of calendar 2021, subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></b>

This press release discusses non-GAAP diluted EPS, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Hologic’s definition of non-GAAP diluted EPS may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Hologic defines its non-GAAP EPS presented in this press release to primarily exclude the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition- and integration-related charges, and income taxes related to such adjustments.

Non-GAAP diluted EPS adjusts for specified items that may be non-cash, or can be highly variable or difficult to predict. In the context of forward-looking statements, the non-GAAP financial measures facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of events that have occurred in the past or may occur in the future and have accounting consequences that can mask underlying operational trends, such as acquisitions, restructurings, debt extinguishment and impairments.

This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease Hologic’s reported results of operations, management encourages investors to review Hologic’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.

Future GAAP EPS may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments, and may also be affected by non-recurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, which are excluded from the calculation of Hologic’s non-GAAP EPS as described in this press release.

When Hologic provides its expectations for non-GAAP EPS on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable effort because Hologic has not estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities expected to be acquired in the transaction. Nor has Hologic determined the fair value of acquired intangible assets and related annual amortization expense that would be required to provide the corresponding GAAP measure. The variability of the items that have not yet been determined may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on Hologic’s future GAAP results.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Forward-Looking Statements</span></b>

This news release contains forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties, including statements about Hologic’s and Bolder’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Such statements include, without limitation: financial or other information based upon or otherwise incorporating judgments or estimates relating to future performance, events or expectations; each company's strategies, positioning, resources, capabilities, and expectations for future performance; and each company's outlook and financial and other guidance.

Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) and Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited (Aurigene) today announced that Exelixis has exercised its exclusive option under the companies’ <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.exelixis.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fexelixis-and-aurigene-enter-exclusive-collaboration-option-and&amp;esheet=52508608&amp;newsitemid=20211014005549&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=July+2019+agreement&amp;index=1&amp;md5=9883a41877677389c7f1dfe001309507"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">July 2019 agreement</a> to in-license XL114 (formerly AUR104), a novel anti-cancer compound that inhibits the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signaling pathway, which promotes lymphocyte survival and proliferation. Exelixis has now assumed responsibility for the future clinical development, commercialization and global manufacturing of XL114. Following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) recent acceptance of its Investigational New Drug (IND) application, Exelixis will soon initiate a phase 1 clinical trial evaluating XL114 monotherapy in patients with Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). At the American Association of Cancer Research Annual Meeting in April of this year, Aurigene presented preclinical data (Abstract 1266) demonstrating that XL114 exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity in a large panel of cancer cell lines ranging from hematological cancers to solid tumors with excellent selectivity over normal cells. In addition, oral dosing of XL114 resulted in significant dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and colon carcinoma models.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“XL114 has shown potent anti-proliferative activity in lymphoma cell lines that have aberrant activation of the CBM signaling pathway and may have a differentiated profile and potential as a best-in-class molecule that could improve outcomes for patients with Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and other hematologic cancers.”</p>

XL114 is the second molecule that Exelixis in-licensed from Aurigene under the companies’ July 2019 collaboration, option and license agreement. Exelixis previously exercised its option to in-license XL102, a potent, selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), from Aurigene in <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20201207005499%2Fen%2FExelixis-In-Licenses-Aurigene&amp;esheet=52508608&amp;newsitemid=20211014005549&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=December+2020&amp;index=2&amp;md5=9d5bf4333618093dae311c0151b6f77e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">December 2020</a> and initiated a phase 1 trial of XL102 as a single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer agents in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors in <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.exelixis.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fexelixis-announces-initiation-phase-1-trial-evaluating-xl102&amp;esheet=52508608&amp;newsitemid=20211014005549&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=January+2021&amp;index=3&amp;md5=2d6e8c598412cbf25c0663380f96eddc"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">January 2021</a>.

“We are pleased that our agreement with Aurigene has generated a second promising compound that warrants advancement into clinical development and believe the collaboration will continue to play an important role in expanding our pipeline,” said Peter Lamb, Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Scientific Strategy and Chief Scientific Officer, Exelixis. “XL114 has shown potent anti-proliferative activity in lymphoma cell lines that have aberrant activation of the CBM signaling pathway and may have a differentiated profile and potential as a best-in-class molecule that could improve outcomes for patients with Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and other hematologic cancers.”

XL114 was identified to have anti-proliferative activity in cell lines with constitutive activation of CBM signaling, including activated B-cell-like DLBCL (ABC-DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma cell lines. Further characterization of XL114 in cell-based assays demonstrated a functional role in B-cell (BCR) signaling pathways. Additionally, XL114 showed dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in an ABC-DLBCL mouse xenograft tumor model. In preclinical development, XL114 also demonstrated a high degree of selectivity against a broad safety pharmacology panel of enzymes and receptors. While the precise molecular mechanism underlying XL114’s function in repressing BCR signaling and MALT1 activation has yet to be characterized, the fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) has been identified as a prominent XL114-binding target.

“XL114 is the second molecule that Exelixis has opted to in-license under our July 2019 agreement, underscoring the significant potential of our approach to the discovery and preclinical development of innovative cancer therapies that target novel mechanisms of action,” said Murali Ramachandra, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, Aurigene. “Exelixis has a track record of success in the clinical development and commercialization of anti-cancer therapies that provide patients with important new treatment options, and we are pleased that the continued advancement of XL114 will be supported by the company’s extensive clinical, regulatory and commercialization infrastructure.”

Under the terms of the July 2019 agreement, Exelixis made an upfront payment of $10 million for exclusive options to obtain an exclusive license from Aurigene to three preexisting programs, including the compounds now known as XL102 and XL114. In addition, Exelixis and Aurigene initiated three Aurigene-led drug discovery programs on mutually agreed upon targets, in exchange for an additional upfront payment of $2.5 million per program. The collaboration was expanded in 2021 to include three additional early discovery programs. Exelixis is also contributing research funding to Aurigene to facilitate discovery and preclinical development work on all nine programs. Exelixis may exercise its option for a program at any time up until the first IND for the program becomes effective. Having exercised options on two programs thus far (XL102 and XL114), if and when Exelixis exercises a future option, it will make an option exercise payment to Aurigene and assume responsibility for that program’s future clinical development and commercialization including global manufacturing. To exercise its option for XL114, Exelixis will make an option exercise payment to Aurigene of $10 million. Once Exelixis exercises its option for a program, Aurigene will be eligible for clinical development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as royalties on future potential sales of the compound. Under the terms of the agreement, Aurigene retains limited development and commercial rights for India and Russia.

<span class=""bw-dateline-wrapper"">PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span><a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com%2F&amp;esheet=52508520&amp;newsitemid=20211015005060&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Bristol+Myers+Squibb&amp;index=1&amp;md5=3e6bee8ffec7ee3e543901cc362eaa96"" rel=""nofollow"">Bristol Myers Squibb</a> (NYSE:BMY) today announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended approval of <i>Zeposia</i> (ozanimod) for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. <i>Zeposia</i>, an oral medication taken once daily,<i></i>is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds with high affinity selectively to S1P subtypes 1 (S1P<sub>1</sub>) and 5 (S1P<sub>5</sub>). The CHMP recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union (EU).

“Despite available therapies, many people living with ulcerative colitis struggle to effectively manage this often relentless and unpredictable disease, making the availability of different treatment options extremely important,” said Jonathan Sadeh, M.D., MSc., senior vice president of Immunology and Fibrosis Development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “With this positive recommendation from the CHMP, we are one step closer to bringing Z<i>eposia, </i>which has the potential to be a truly transformative medicine, and<i></i>the first and only oral S1P receptor modulator for ulcerative colitis, to appropriate patients in the EU living with the disease.”

The CHMP adopted this positive opinion based on data from True North, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating <i>Zeposia</i> as an induction and maintenance therapy versus placebo in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. The trial demonstrated significant improvements across all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints – including clinical remission, clinical response, endoscopic improvement and endoscopic histologic mucosal improvement – versus placebo at Week 10 and Week 52. The overall safety observed in True North was consistent with the known safety profile for <i>Zeposia</i> in approved labeling. The clinical findings from True North, entitled “Ozanimod as Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Ulcerative Colitis,” were published in the September 30<sup>th</sup> issue of <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC on May 27, 2021.

Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the True North clinical trial.

<b>About True North</b>

True North is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of <i>Zeposia</i> 0.92 mg in patients with moderately to severely active UC who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to any of the following: oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators or a biologic. Patients were to be receiving treatment with oral aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids prior to and during the induction period. A total of 30% of patients had previously failed or were intolerant to TNF blockers. Of these patients, 63% received at least two biologics including TNF blockers. At study entry, mean age was 42 years, 60% were male and mean disease duration was 7 years; patient characteristics were well-balanced across treatment groups. In the 10-week induction study (UC Study 1), a total of 645 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive <i>Zeposia</i> (n=429) or placebo (n=216), of whom 94% and 89%, respectively, completed the induction study. No new safety signals were observed in the induction phase.

In maintenance, UC Study 2, a total of 457 patients who received <i>Zeposia</i> in either UC Study 1 or in an open-label arm and achieved clinical response at Week 10 were re-randomized 1:1 and were treated with either <i>Zeposia</i> 0.92 mg (n=230) or placebo (n=227) for 42 weeks (UC Study 2), for a total of 52 weeks of treatment. Concomitant aminosalicylates were required to remain stable through week 52. Patients on concomitant corticosteroids were to taper their dose upon entering the maintenance study. Of these, 80% and 54.6% of patients who received <i>Zeposia</i> and placebo, respectively, completed the study. In the maintenance phase, the overall safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile for <i>Zeposia</i> and patients with moderate-to-severe UC.

All eligible patients were rolled into an open-label extension trial, which is ongoing and designed to assess the longer-term profile of <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC.

<b>About Ulcerative Colitis</b>

Ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is characterized by an irregular, chronic immune response that creates inflammation and ulcers (sores) in the mucosa (lining) of the large intestine (colon) or rectum. Symptoms include bloody stools, severe diarrhea and frequent abdominal pain. Ulcerative colitis has a major impact on patients' health-related quality of life, including physical functioning, social and emotional well-being and ability to go to work/school. Many patients have an inadequate response or do not respond at all to currently available therapies.It is estimated that approximately 12.6 million people worldwide are living with IBD.

<b>About Zeposia (ozanimod)</b>

<i>Zeposia</i> (ozanimod) is an oral, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5. <i>Zeposia</i> reduces the capacity of lymphocytes to migrate from lymphoid tissue, reducing the number of circulating lymphocytes in peripheral blood. The mechanism by which <i>Zeposia</i> exerts therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis is unknown but may involve the reduction of lymphocyte migration into the intestines.

Bristol Myers Squibb is continuing to evaluate <i>Zeposia </i>in an open-label extension trial, which is ongoing and designed to assess the longer-term profile of <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The company is also investigating <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in the ongoing Phase 3 YELLOWSTONE clinical trial program.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC on May 27, 2021. <i>Zeposia</i> was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in March 2020. The European Commission approved <i>Zeposia</i> for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with active disease as defined by clinical or imaging features in May 2020.

<b>FDA APPROVED INDICATIONS</b>

ZEPOSIA (ozanimod) is indicated for the treatment of:

1. Relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.

2. Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>Contraindications:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Patients who in the last 6 months, experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III/IV heart failure or have the presence of Mobitz type II second-degree or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial block, unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker</li>
 	<li>Patients with severe untreated sleep apnea</li>
 	<li>Patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor</li>
</ul>
<b>Infections:</b> ZEPOSIA may increase the susceptibility to infections. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain a recent (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS or UC therapy) complete blood count (CBC) including lymphocyte count before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Delay initiation of ZEPOSIA in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. Consider interruption of treatment with ZEPOSIA if a patient develops a serious infection. Continue monitoring for infections up to 3 months after discontinuing ZEPOSIA
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Herpes zoster was reported as an adverse reaction in ZEPOSIA-treated patients. Herpes simplex encephalitis and varicella zoster meningitis have been reported with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. Patients without a healthcare professional-confirmed history of varicella (chickenpox), or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV), should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating ZEPOSIA. A full course of vaccination for antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with ZEPOSIA</li>
 	<li>Cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis (CM) were reported in patients treated with another S1P receptor modulator. If CM is suspected, ZEPOSIA should be suspended until cryptococcal infection has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be initiated</li>
 	<li>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that typically occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. PML has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators and other MS and UC therapies and has been associated with some risk factors. If PML is suspected, withhold ZEPOSIA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. If confirmed, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued</li>
 	<li>In the MS and UC clinical studies, patients who received ZEPOSIA were not to receive concomitant treatment with antineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies used for treatment of MS and UC. Concomitant use of ZEPOSIA with any of these therapies would be expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression. When switching to ZEPOSIA from immunosuppressive medications, consider the duration of their effects and their mode of action to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects</li>
 	<li>Use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and for 3 months after treatment with ZEPOSIA. If live attenuated vaccine immunizations are required, administer at least 1 month prior to initiation of ZEPOSIA</li>
</ul>
<b>Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Conduction Delays:</b> Since initiation of ZEPOSIA may result in a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays, dose titration is recommended to help reduce cardiac effects. Initiation of ZEPOSIA without dose escalation may result in greater decreases in heart rate. If treatment with ZEPOSIA is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought for those individuals:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>with significant QT prolongation</li>
 	<li>with arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class 1a or III anti-arrhythmic drugs</li>
 	<li>with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension</li>
 	<li>with a history of Mobitz type II second-degree or higher AV block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block</li>
</ul>
<b>Liver Injury:</b> Elevations of aminotransferases may occur in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain liver function tests, if not recently available (i.e., within 6 months), before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction should have hepatic enzymes checked and ZEPOSIA should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Caution should be exercised when using ZEPOSIA in patients with history of significant liver disease

<b>Fetal Risk:</b> There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal studies, ZEPOSIA may cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 3 months after stopping ZEPOSIA

<b>Increased Blood Pressure:</b> Increase in systolic pressure was observed after about 3 months of treatment and persisted throughout treatment. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment and managed appropriately. Certain foods that may contain very high amounts of tyramine could cause severe hypertension in patients taking ZEPOSIA. Patients should be advised to avoid foods containing a very large amount of tyramine while taking ZEPOSIA

<b>Respiratory Effects:</b> ZEPOSIA may cause a decline in pulmonary function. Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function should be performed during therapy, if clinically indicated

<b>Macular edema:</b> S1P modulators have been associated with an increased risk of macular edema. Patients with a history of uveitis or diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Patients with a history of these conditions should have an ophthalmic evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, prior to treatment initiation and regular follow-up examinations. An ophthalmic evaluation is recommended in all patients at any time if there is a change in vision. Continued use of ZEPOSIA in patients with macular edema has not been evaluated; potential benefits and risks for the individual patient should be considered if deciding whether ZEPOSIA should be discontinued

<b>Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES):</b> Rare cases of PRES have been reported in patients receiving a S1P receptor modulator. If a ZEPOSIA-treated patient develops unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms or any symptom/sign suggestive of an increase in intracranial pressure, a complete physical and neurological examination should be conducted. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued

<b>Unintended Additive Immunosuppressive Effects From Prior Immunosuppressive or Immune-Modulating Drugs:</b> When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects while at the same time minimizing risk of disease reactivation. Initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA after treatment with alemtuzumab is not recommended

<b>Severe Increase in Disability After Stopping ZEPOSIA:</b> Severe exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after discontinuation of a S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease should be considered after stopping ZEPOSIA treatment so patients should be monitored upon discontinuation

<b>Immune System Effects After Stopping ZEPOSIA: </b>After discontinuing ZEPOSIA, the median time for lymphocyte counts to return to the normal range was 30 days with approximately 90% of patients in the normal range within 3 months. Use of immunosuppressants within this period may lead to an additive effect on the immune system, therefore caution should be applied when initiating other drugs 4 weeks after the last dose of ZEPOSIA

<b>Most Common Adverse Reactions that occurred in the MS clinical trials of ZEPOSIA-treated patients (= 4%): </b>upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infection, back pain, and hypertension

In the UC clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions that occurred in =4% of ZEPOSIA-treated patients and greater than in patients who received placebo were upper respiratory infection, liver test increased, and headache

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY),<b> </b>today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Tecentriq<sup>®</sup> (atezolizumab) as adjuvant treatment following surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy for adults with Stage II-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1=1%, as determined by an FDA-approved test.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“Too many patients with early-stage lung cancer experience disease recurrence following surgery. Now, the availability of immunotherapy following surgery and chemotherapy offers many patients new hope and a powerful new tool to reduce their risk of cancer relapse”</p>

<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211015005506/en/FDA-Approves-Genentech%E2%80%99s-Tecentriq-as-Adjuvant-Treatment-for-Certain-People-With-Early-Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
“Tecentriq is now the first and only cancer immunotherapy available for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, introducing a new era where people diagnosed with early lung cancer may have the opportunity to receive immunotherapy to increase their chances for cure,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “Today’s landmark approval gives physicians and patients a new way to treat early lung cancer that has the potential to significantly reduce risk of cancer recurrence, after more than a decade with limited treatment advances in this setting.”

“Too many patients with early-stage lung cancer experience disease recurrence following surgery. Now, the availability of immunotherapy following surgery and chemotherapy offers many patients new hope and a powerful new tool to reduce their risk of cancer relapse,” said Bonnie Addario, Co-founder and Chair, GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer. “With this approval, it is more important than ever to screen for lung cancer early and test for PD-L1 at diagnosis to help bring this advance to the people who can benefit.”

The approval is based on results from an interim analysis of the Phase III IMpower010 study that showed treatment with Tecentriq following surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 34% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.66, 95% CI: 0.50-0.88) in people with Stage II-IIIA (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1=1%, compared with best supportive care (BSC). Safety data for Tecentriq were consistent with its known safety profile and no new safety signals were identified. Fatal and serious adverse reactions occurred in 1.8% and 18%, respectively, of patients receiving Tecentriq. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (&gt;1%) were pneumonia (1.8%), pneumonitis (1.6%), and pyrexia (1.2%).

The review of this application was conducted under the FDA’s Project Orbis initiative, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among international partners. According to the FDA, collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions. Simultaneous applications were submitted to regulators in the United States, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and Australia under Project Orbis. Additionally, the FDA reviewed and approved the supplemental application under its Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program, which aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible.

Tecentriq has previously shown clinically meaningful benefit in various types of lung cancer, with six currently approved indications in the U.S. In addition to becoming the first approved cancer immunotherapy for adjuvant NSCLC, Tecentriq was also the first approved cancer immunotherapy for front-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (chemotherapy). Tecentriq also has four approved indications in advanced NSCLC as either a single agent or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies. Tecentriq is available in three dosing options, providing the flexibility to choose administration every two, three or four weeks.

Genentech has an extensive development program for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across different lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines, as well as studies in metastatic, adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings across various tumor types.

<b>About the IMpower010 study</b>

IMpower010 is a Phase III, global, multicenter, open-label, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq compared with BSC, in participants with Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC (UICC/AJCC 7th edition), following surgical resection and up to 4 cycles of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The study randomized 1,005 people with a ratio of 1:1 to receive either Tecentriq for 1 year (16 cycles), unless disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity occurred, or BSC. The primary endpoint is investigator-determined DFS in the PD-L1-positive Stage II-IIIA, all randomized Stage II-IIIA and intent-to-treat (ITT) Stage IB-IIIA populations. Key secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) in the overall study population, ITT Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC.

<b>About lung cancer</b>

According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that more than 235,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2021. NSCLC accounts for 80-85% of all lung cancers and approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with NSCLC are diagnosed with early-stage (Stages I and II) or locally advanced (Stage III) disease. Today, about half of all people with early lung cancer still experience a cancer recurrence following surgery. Treating lung cancer early, before it has spread, may help prevent the disease from returning and provide people with the best opportunity for a cure.

<b>About Tecentriq<sup>®</sup> (atezolizumab)</b>

Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1. Tecentriq is designed to bind to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the re-activation of T cells. Tecentriq may also affect normal cells.

<b>Tecentriq U.S. Indications</b>

These complications may happen if patients undergo transplantation either before or after being treated with Tecentriq. A healthcare provider will monitor for these complications.

<b>Getting medical treatment right away may help keep these problems from becoming more serious. </b>A healthcare provider will check patients for these problems during their treatment with Tecentriq. A healthcare provider may treat patients with corticosteroid or hormone replacement medicines. A healthcare provider may also need to delay or completely stop treatment with Tecentriq if patients have severe side effects.

<b>Before receiving Tecentriq, patients should tell their healthcare provider about all of their medical conditions, including if they:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>have immune system problems such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or lupus</li>
 	<li>have received an organ transplant</li>

AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the approval of risankizumab (SKYRIZI<sup class=""last-child"">®</sup>, 150 mg, subcutaneous injection at week 0, week 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter) alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The CHMP positive opinion is a scientific recommendation for marketing authorization to the European Commission, which authorizes marketing approval in the European Union.

This CHMP positive opinion was supported by data from two pivotal Phase 3 studies, KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2, which evaluated risankizumab in adults with active psoriatic arthritis including those who had responded inadequately or were intolerant to biologic therapy and/or non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).<sup class=""first-child"">1,2</sup> Additionally, the efficacy and safety profile of risankizumab with up to 52 weeks of exposure was consistent with the profile observed up to 24 weeks.<sup class=""last-child"">8</sup>

""Many patients with psoriatic arthritis experience uncontrolled skin and joint symptoms despite the availability of existing therapies. For this reason, it is important to have multiple treatment options available for physicians to effectively manage their patients' condition,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Thomas Hudson</span>, senior vice president, research and development, AbbVie. ""The CHMP's recommendation to approve risankizumab in psoriatic arthritis is an important step in bringing treatment to more patients in need.""

Across the Phase 3 KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2 clinical studies, risankizumab met the primary endpoint of ACR20 response at week 24 versus placebo.<sup class=""first-child"">1,2</sup> In both studies, risankizumab also met ranked secondary endpoints including, but not limited to improvements in several clinical manifestations of psoriatic arthritis such as skin clearance (as measured by at least a 90 percent improvement in Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI 90]), physical function (as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index [HAQ-DI]) and minimal disease activity (MDA) at week 24. In both KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2, the most common adverse reactions associated with risankizumab were upper respiratory infections, headache, fatigue, injection site reactions and tinea infections.<sup class=""last-child"">1,2</sup>

If the CHMP recommendation is accepted by the European Commission, this will mark the second indication for risankizumab in the European Union, which was approved in 2019 for the treatment of adult plaque psoriasis. The Marketing Authorization will be valid in all member states of the European Union, as well as <span class=""xn-location first-child"">Iceland</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Liechtenstein</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Norway</span> and <span class=""xn-location last-child"">Northern Ireland</span>.

Risankizumab (SKYRIZI<sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup>) is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally.

Use of risankizumab in psoriatic arthritis is not approved and its safety and efficacy are under evaluation by regulatory authorities.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About Psoriatic Arthritis</b>

Psoriatic arthritis is a heterogeneous, systemic inflammatory disease with hallmark manifestations across multiple domains including joints and skin.<sup class=""first-child"">5,6</sup> In psoriatic arthritis, the immune system creates inflammation that can lead to pain, fatigue, stiffness in the joints and cause a red, scaly rash.<sup class=""last-child"">5,6</sup>

<b class=""first-child"">About KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2</b><sup class=""last-child"">1,2,3,8</sup>

KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2 are both Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risankizumab in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. KEEPsAKE-1 evaluated risankizumab in patients who had an inadequate response or intolerance to at least one DMARD. KEEPsAKE-2 evaluated risankizumab in patients who had an inadequate response or intolerance to biologic therapy and/or DMARDs. Patients were randomized to risankizumab 150 mg or placebo followed by risankizumab 150 mg at week 24. Patients randomized to risankizumab received four maintenance doses a year, following two initiation doses.

The primary endpoint for both studies was the achievement of ACR20 response at week 24. Ranked secondary endpoints included, but were not limited to, change from baseline in HAQ-DI, as well as the achievement of PASI 90 and minimal disease activity (MDA) at week 24. The studies are ongoing, and the long-term extension remains blinded to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of risankizumab in patients who have completed the placebo-controlled period.

More information on these trials can be found at <a class=""first-child last-child"" href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3322944-1&amp;h=1487761812&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2F&amp;a=www.clinicaltrials.gov"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a> (KEEPsAKE-1: NCT03675308; KEEPsAKE-2: NCT03671148).

<b class=""first-child"">About SKYRIZI<sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup></b> <b>(risankizumab)</b><sup class=""last-child"">3</sup>

SKYRIZI is an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor that selectively blocks IL-23 by binding to its p19 subunit.<sup class=""first-child"">3,9</sup> IL-23, a cytokine involved in inflammatory processes, is thought to be linked to a number of chronic immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis.<sup>9 </sup>The approved dose for SKYRIZI is 150 mg (two 75 mg injections), administered by subcutaneous injection at week 0 and 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Phase 3 trials of SKYRIZI in psoriasis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis are ongoing.<sup class=""last-child"">10,11,12,13</sup>

<b class=""first-child"">Important EU Indication and Safety Information about SKYRIZI<sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup> (risankizumab)</b><sup class=""last-child"">3</sup>

SKYRIZI is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.

SKYRIZI is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. SKYRIZI may increase the risk of infection. In patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, or known risk factors for infection, SKYRIZI should be used with caution. Treatment with SKYRIZI should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

Prior to initiating treatment with SKYRIZI, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving SKYRIZI should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating SKYRIZI in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.

Prior to initiating therapy with SKYRIZI, completion of all appropriate immunizations should be considered according to current immunization guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination (viral or bacterial), it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with SKYRIZI. Patients treated with SKYRIZI should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory infections, which occurred in 13 percent of patients. Commonly (greater than or equal to 1/100 to less than 1/10) reported adverse reactions included tinea infections, headache, pruritus, fatigue and injection site reactions.

Boehringer Ingelheim today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Cyltezo<sup>®</sup> (adalimumab-adbm) as the first Interchangeable biosimilar with Humira<sup>®</sup> (adalimumab). The FDA originally approved Cyltezo<sup>®</sup> in 2017 for the treatment of multiple chronic inflammatory diseases and this latest approval designates it as Interchangeable across all of these indications.

""We are proud to be the company driving the advancement of biosimilars and delivering the first and only Interchangeable biosimilar with Humira<sup>®</sup>. It is a true milestone and an important step forward for broader adoption in the U.S. and for patient access to affordable medicines,"" said Thomas Seck, senior vice president, Medicine and Regulatory Affairs at Boehringer Ingelheim. ""The Interchangeability status of Cyltezo<sup>®</sup> reinforces our goal of expanding overall treatment options and contributing to the quality and sustainability of the U.S. healthcare system.""

A biosimilar is a biological medicine that is developed to be highly similar to an approved reference biologic, with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, potency and purity. An Interchangeable biosimilar must first meet the high FDA standards of a biosimilar. Then, in order to achieve the interchangeable designation, the FDA requires an additional clinical study of multiple substitutions in patients, known as an Interchangeability study. This type of study shows how patients do when they are switched back and forth multiple times from a reference product to the Interchangeable biosimilar candidate. A biosimilar with an Interchangeable designation can be auto-substituted by a pharmacist for the reference product, with individual state laws controlling how and whether physicians will be notified.

""As the first Interchangeable biosimilar of Humira<sup>®</sup>, Cyltezo<sup>®</sup> (adalimumab-adbm), represents an important step toward bringing patients more affordable treatment options for complex, and often expensive, biologic reference products,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Martin Alan Menter</span>, MD, chairman of the Division of Dermatology at <span class=""xn-org"">Baylor University</span> Medical Center. ""This is incredibly important for patients, who can be confident that once available, citrate-free Cyltezo<sup>®</sup> has the same efficacy and safety as the originator medicine with the added benefit of cost savings.""

The approval for Interchangeability was supported by positive data from Boehringer Ingelheim's Phase III randomized VOLTAIRE-X clinical trial and marks the first FDA approval for such a study. The VOLTAIRE-X trial studied the effects of multiple switches between Humira<sup>®</sup> and Cyltezo<sup>®</sup>. This additional study demonstrated that Cyltezo<sup>®</sup> is equivalent to Humira<sup>®</sup> with no meaningful clinical differences in pharmacokinetics, efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety between the switching and continuous treatment groups. The results were presented at the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3322330-1&amp;h=3698620552&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boehringer-ingelheim.us%2Fpress-release%2Fvoltaire-x-phase-iii-data-patients-moderate-severe-chronic-plaque-psoriasis-support&amp;a=American+Academy+of+Dermatology+2021"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">American Academy of Dermatology 2021</a> conference.

Cyltezo<sup>®</sup> is not commercially available in the U.S. at this time, but its commercial license will begin on <span class=""xn-chron"">July 1, 2023</span>.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR CYLTEZO<sup>®</sup><br class=""dnr"" />WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY</b>

<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</b>

<b>Patients treated with adalimumab products, including CYLTEZO, are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.</b>

<b>Discontinue CYLTEZO if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.</b>

<b>Reported infections include:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before CYLTEZO use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to CYLTEZO use.</b><br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li><b>Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.</b><br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li><b>Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with CYLTEZO prior to initiating therapy in patients: 1. with chronic or recurrent infection, 2. who have been exposed to TB, 3. with a history of opportunistic infection, 4. who resided in or traveled in regions where mycoses are endemic, 5. with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CYLTEZO, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy. </b>
<ul>
 	<li>Do not start CYLTEZO during an active infection, including localized infections.<br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li>Patients older than 65 years, patients with co-morbid conditions, and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at greater risk of infection.<br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li>If an infection develops, monitor carefully and initiate appropriate therapy.<br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li>Drug interactions with biologic products: A higher rate of serious infections has been observed in RA patients treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. An increased risk of serious infections has been seen with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no demonstrated added benefit in patients with RA. Concomitant administration of CYLTEZO with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra or abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based on the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions.</li>
</ul>
<b>MALIGNANCY</b>

<b>Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants.</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment prior to initiating or continuing therapy in a patient with known malignancy.<br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li>In clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies were observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control patients.<br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li>Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was reported during clinical trials for adalimumab-treated patients. Examine all patients, particularly those with a history of prolonged immunosuppressant or PUVA therapy, for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with CYLTEZO.<br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li>In adalimumab clinical trials, there was an approximate 3-fold higher rate of lymphoma than expected in the general U.S. population. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at higher risk of lymphoma than the general population, even in the absence of TNF blockers.<br class=""dnr"" /></li>
 	<li>Postmarketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia were reported with TNF blocker use. Approximately half of the postmarketing cases of malignancies in children, adolescents, and young adults receiving TNF blockers were lymphomas; other cases included rare malignancies associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually observed in children and adolescents.</li>
</ul>
<b>Hypersensitivity Reactions</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, stop CYLTEZO and institute appropriate therapy.</li>
</ul>
<b>Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Use of TNF blockers, including CYLTEZO, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases have been fatal. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in patients who are carriers of HBV and monitor them during and after CYLTEZO treatment. Discontinue CYLTEZO and begin antiviral therapy in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Exercise caution when resuming CYLTEZO after HBV treatment.</li>
</ul>
<b>Neurologic Reactions</b>
<ul>
 	<li>TNF blockers, including adalimumab products, have been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system and peripheral demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Exercise caution when considering CYLTEZO for patients with these disorders; discontinuation of CYLTEZO should be considered if any of these disorders develop.</li>
</ul>
<b>Hematological Reactions</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Rare reports of pancytopenia, including aplastic anemia, have been reported with TNF blockers. Medically significant cytopenia has been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. Consider stopping CYLTEZO if significant hematologic abnormalities occur.</li>
</ul>
<b>Congestive Heart Failure</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab.  Exercise caution when using CYLTEZO in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully.</li>
</ul>
<b>Autoimmunity</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.</li>
</ul>
<b>Immunizations</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Patients on CYLTEZO should not receive live vaccines. Pediatric patients, if possible, should be brought up to date with all immunizations before initiating CYLTEZO therapy. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants.</li>
</ul>
<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>
<ul>
 	<li>The most common adverse reactions in adalimumab clinical trials (&gt;10%) were: infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache, and rash.</li>
</ul>

<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

Innovent Biologics, Inc. (""Innovent"") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that the sintilimab ORIENT-31 study has met its prespecified primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) at the first interim analysis.

Globally, ORIENT-31 is the first prospective, double-blind, multi-center, Phase 3 study that has demonstrated significant PFS improvement of anti-PD-1 and anti-VEGF antibody combination therapy (i.e., sintilimab plus BYVASDA® [bevacizumab biosimilar injection] combined with chemotherapy [pemetrexed and cisplatin]) in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsqNSCLC) that has progressed after treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

In the first interim analysis reviewed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, based on assessment by the Blinded Independent Radiographic Review Committee (BIRRC), sintilimab in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) and chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with chemotherapy. Sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy also showed a trend of PFS benefit compared to chemotherapy alone (data is not yet mature). Additionally, the prespecified PFS futility analysis that compares sintilimab in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) and chemotherapy to sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy did not cross futility stopping boundary. A numerical benefit of adding BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) to sintilimab and chemotherapy combination can be observed. The safety profile of this study was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies of sintilimab and BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection), with no additional safety signals. The detailed results of ORIENT-31 will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.

The principal investigator of the ORIENT-31, Prof. <span class=""xn-person"">Shun Lu</span> from the Oncology Department of Shanghai Chest Hospital, stated, ""For patients with EGFR-mutated advanced nsqNSCLC who have progressed following EGFR-TKI treatment, platinum-based chemotherapy is the current standard of care, but with limited benefit. New treatments are clearly imperative. ORIENT-31 is the first prospective, double-blind Phase 3 study worldwide to demonstrate significant PFS benefit with an anti-PD-1 antibody combination therapy in this patient population. It has shown the clinical value of adding sintilimab plus BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) to platinum chemotherapy. This quadruple regimen has the potential to bring forth a new and more effective treatment option to patients with EGFR-mutated nsqNSCLC following treatment with an EGFR TKI.""

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Hui Zhou</span>, Senior Vice President of Innovent, stated, ""Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate among all tumor types both in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> and worldwide. In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, EGFR-mutated NSCLC accounts for 40% to 50% of nonsquamous NSCLC, and the treatment options for these patients after treatment with first, second and third generation EGFR-TKIs are very limited, representing a large unmet medical need. Through the joint efforts of investigators, ORIENT-31 achieved these encouraging research results. We are grateful for all the contributions made by the investigators and patients in this study – together we accomplished this important milestone.""

<b>About Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</b>

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and the second most commonly diagnosed tumor type. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 80% to 85% of all lung cancer, in which about 70% of NSCLC patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease that is not suitable for surgical resection at diagnosis. In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, nsqNSCLC accounts for 70% of NSCLC, in which about 40% to 50% of nsqNSCLC patients have an EGFR mutation. The standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC is a third generation EGFR TKI, or first or second generation EGFR TKI. For patients who have progressed following EGFR-TKI treatment, platinum-based chemotherapy is still the standard therapy with limited benefit, representing a large unmet medical need.

<b>About the ORIENT-31 Study</b>

ORIENT-31 is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 clinical study evaluating sintilimab, with or without BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection), combined with chemotherapy (pemetrexed and cisplatin) in patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who have progressed following EGFR TKI treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, <u><a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03745170"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT003802240</a></u>). The primary endpoint is PFS as assessed by BIRRC based on RECIST v1.1. The secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), PFS as assessed by investigators, objective response rate (ORR) and safety.

Eligible patients included: patients with disease progression following first or second generation EGFR TKI and confirmed as T790M negative, or T790M positive but further progressed on third generation EGFR-TKI treatment, or patients with disease progression following third generation EGFR-TKI as first line treatment.

Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive sintilimab plus BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin, sintilimab plus placebo 2 combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin, or placebo 1 plus placebo 2 combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin. After 4 cycles of combination treatment, patients will receive maintenance treatment of sintilimab plus BYVASDA® and pemetrexed, sintilimab plus placebo 2 and pemetrexed, placebo 1 plus placebo 2 and pemetrexed, until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other conditions that required treatment discontinuation. Target accrual is 480 patients.

<b>About Sintilimab</b>

Sintilimab, marketed as TYVYT<sup>®</sup> (sintilimab injection) in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, is an innovative PD-1 inhibitor with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Eli Lilly and Company. Sintilimab is an immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1 / PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies of sintilimab worldwide, to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials.

In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, sintilimab has been approved for four indications, including:
<ul>
 	<li>The treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy</li>
 	<li>In combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
 	<li>In combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer</li>
 	<li>In combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) for the first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma</li>
</ul>
Additionally, Innovent currently has one regulatory submission under review in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> for sintilimab, for the first line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Additionally, four clinical studies of sintilimab have met their primary endpoints:
<ul>
 	<li>Phase 3 study in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine for the first-line treatment of unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.</li>
 	<li>Phase 2 study as second-line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma</li>
 	<li>Phase 3 study as second-line treatment for squamous NSCLC with disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy</li>
 	<li>Phase 3 study in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) and chemotherapy (pemetrexed and cisplatin) for EGFR-mutated nonsquamous NSCLC following EGFR-TKI treatment.</li>
</ul>
In <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2021</span>, the U.S. FDA accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Sintilimab was included in <span class=""xn-location"">China's</span> National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in 2019 as the first PD-1 inhibitor and the only PD-1 included in the list in that year.

<b>About BYVASDA<sup>®</sup> (bevacizumab biosimilar injection)</b>

BYVASDA<sup>®</sup>, also known as IBI305, is a bevacizumab biosimilar and a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important factor in angiogenesis that is highly expressed by the endothelial cells in most human tumors. An anti-VEGF antibody binds VEGF-A selectively with high affinity and blocks its binding to VEGF-2 receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt/PKB and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK. BYVASDA<sup>®</sup> produces anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the growth, proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, blocking angiogenesis, reducing vascular permeability, blocking blood supply to tumor tissues, inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Since its launch, bevacizumab has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in these tumor types have been well recognized worldwide.

In <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) is approved for indications including advanced non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, adult recurrent glioblastoma, and advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

METTL3 program

One of the most prevalent modifications within mRNA is the methylation of the adenine base at the N6 position, resulting in N6-methyladenosine (m6A). This modification is catalyzed by the methyltransferase enzyme complex METTL3/METTL14. m6A is involved in several aspects of mRNA stability and turnover, controls translation of oncogenes that confer growth advantage and migratory behavior and has emerged as a key mRNA modification implicated in hematological cancers. Knockout of METTL3 and/or METTL14 promotes AML differentiation and apoptosis and has been shown to be important for both in vitro and in vivo growth for AML. Accent Therapeutic’s novel investigational small molecule inhibitors of METTL3 seek to treat specific sub-types of AML with high unmet medical need.

Ipsen’s forward-looking statements

The forward-looking statements, objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy, current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’, ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events, including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover, the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore, the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore, Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during pre-clinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business, financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements, targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2020 Registration Document, available on ipsen.com.

Wave Life Sciences Ltd. (Nasdaq: WVE), a clinical-stage genetic medicines company committed to delivering life-changing treatments for people battling devastating diseases, today announced an amendment to its ongoing collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, which immediately discontinues the discovery research component of the collaboration that provided Takeda with the right to license multiple preclinical programs for central nervous system (CNS) indications over a four-year research term. Under terms of the amendment, Takeda will pay Wave $22.5 million for collaboration-related research and preclinical expenses. The amendment announced today allows Wave to advance CNS programs independently or enter partnerships in the CNS field outside of the three specified targets, which are part of the ongoing late-stage collaboration between the companies.

The late-stage component of the original collaboration led by Wave remains unchanged, including Takeda’s option to co-develop and co-commercialize CNS therapies for three targets, C9orf72, HTT and ATXN3, including WVE-004 and WVE-003. WVE-004 and WVE-003 are currently being investigated in the ongoing Phase 1b/2a FOCUS-C9 clinical trial for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, and the ongoing Phase 1b/2a SELECT-HD clinical trial for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, respectively. Should Takeda opt in on any of these programs, Wave would receive an opt-in payment and would lead manufacturing and joint clinical co-development activities. Takeda would lead joint co-commercial activities in the United States and all commercial activities outside of the United States. Global costs and potential profits would be shared 50:50 and Wave would be eligible to receive development and commercial milestone payments.

“This amendment streamlines our existing collaboration with Takeda and immediately enables us to advance or partner early-stage CNS programs, outside of the C9orf72, HTT, and ATXN3 targets, and including those leveraging our ADAR editing capability,” said Paul Bolno, MD, MBA, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wave Life Sciences. “Over many years, the collaboration with Takeda has yielded value for Wave and the patients we aim to serve. We look forward to continuing the partnership as we advance our ongoing clinical programs.”

Wave’s cash runway remains unchanged. The company expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with expected and committed cash from its existing collaboration, will enable the company to fund its operating and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2023.

Lipocine Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lipocine-and-antares-pharma-enter-into-us-licensing-agreement-to-commercialize-tlando-301401345.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">LPCN</a>), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on metabolic and endocrine disorders, today announced it has entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Antares Pharma, Inc. to commercialize TLANDO in the United States.  TLANDO is an oral testosterone product for testosterone replacement therapy (""TRT"") in adult males indicated for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone: primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired).

As previously announced, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") granted tentative approval to TLANDO.  Upon the expiration of the exclusivity period granted to Clarus Therapeutics, Inc., with respect to its drug, JATENZO<sup>®</sup>, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which expires on <span class=""xn-chron"">March 27, 2022</span>, TLANDO will be eligible for final approval. The FDA has affirmed the NDA resubmission for final approval will be a Class 1 resubmission which includes a two-month FDA review goal period.

Under the terms of the agreement, Lipocine will receive an immediate upfront cash payment of <span class=""xn-money"">$11.0 million</span> and, subject to certain conditions, an additional <span class=""xn-money"">$5.0 million</span> licensing payment in <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2025</span> and another <span class=""xn-money"">$5.0 million</span> licensing payment in January 2026.  Lipocine will also be entitled to receive sales-based commercial milestone payments totaling up to <span class=""xn-money"">$160.0 million</span> based on TLANDO net sales and, if Antares Pharma exercises its option, TLANDO XR sales, in addition to tiered royalty payments at rates ranging from the mid-teens to up to 20% on net sales of TLANDO. Lipocine retains all rights for ex-US territories, and non TRT indications for TLANDO. Under the agreement, Antares Pharma will undertake all commercialization, post-marketing obligations, and sourcing of TLANDO in the U.S.

In addition, Lipocine has granted Antares Pharma an option to license, on or before <span class=""xn-chron"">March 31, 2022</span>, TLANDO XR, a next-generation, potential once-daily oral product candidate for TRT, in the U.S.  TLANDO XR met primary and secondary regulatory end points for TRT in an earlier Phase 2 clinical study. Upon exercise of the TLANDO XR option, Lipocine is entitled to receive an additional <span class=""xn-money"">$4.0 million</span> in license fees, clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to an aggregate of <span class=""xn-money"">$35.0 million</span>, and tiered royalties on net sales at rates ranging from the mid-teens to up to 20%. Antares Pharma will be responsible for development costs, regulatory filings, commercialization, and post-marketing commitments for TLANDO XR.

""We are very pleased to be partnering with Antares Pharma, a strong market leader with one of the largest sales forces in the TRT space,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Mahesh Patel</span>, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lipocine. Dr. Patel further stated, ""Our agreement with Antares Pharma demonstrates our commitment to ensure efficient and effective patient access to TLANDO in the U.S. We are confident in Antares Pharma's capabilities, given its established marketing experience and demonstrated success in the TRT space. Consistent with our current core competency, this agreement allows us to focus diligently on progressing our innovative pipeline candidates with the goal of serving patients with serious unmet needs.""

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new low-dose tablet dosage form of Biktarvy<b><sup>®</sup></b> (bictegravir 30 mg/emtricitabine 120 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 15 mg tablets) for pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg to less than 25 kg who are virologically suppressed or new to antiretroviral therapy. The approval of this supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) expands the indication for Biktarvy to include younger children living with HIV-1 infection and will help to close the gap between HIV treatment options available for adults and children.

“Children living with HIV are in need of effective and accessible formulations of antiretroviral therapy,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “To address this unmet need, innovations in pediatric formulations must strive towards expanding treatment options for children. The sNDA approval is an important step in fulfilling Gilead’s commitment to a goal of bringing pediatric formulations of Biktarvy to children living with HIV around the world.”

While effective available treatment options for pregnant women living with HIV lower the likelihood of perinatal HIV infection transmission, pediatric HIV remains a global health problem. Each day in 2020, approximately 850 children worldwide became infected with HIV and approximately 330 children died from AIDS-related causes, mostly because of inadequate access to HIV care and treatment services. The availability of a single-tablet antiretroviral regimen for children weighing at least 14 kg is a significant milestone with the potential to save many lives.

“As children living with HIV will be on therapy for the foreseeable future and from such a young age, there are a number of factors I weigh as a clinician when prescribing the right HIV treatment option to my pediatric patients,” said Carina Rodriguez, MD, Professor of Pediatrics and Division Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine. “Finding an efficacious treatment option is paramount, but tolerability and safety are keys to ensuring treatment success. With this expanded approval, clinicians can add Biktarvy to their arsenal of options to help ensure these children maintain virologic suppression with a treatment option that makes sense for them.”

In the United States, Biktarvy is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of Biktarvy. Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning for post treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B; please see below for additional Important Safety Information for Biktarvy.

The approval of Biktarvy for children weighing at least 14 kg is based on data from Cohort 3 of a Phase 2/3 open-label, single-arm study (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT02881320&amp;esheet=52510417&amp;newsitemid=20211018005505&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT02881320&amp;index=1&amp;md5=d3d577862de3cba93b8b39f199ca8ac6"" rel=""nofollow"">NCT02881320</a>), which found Biktarvy low-dose tablets to be effective and generally well-tolerated through 24 weeks in virologically suppressed children living with HIV-1. Cohort 3 enrolled 22 participants weighing =14 to &lt;25 kg who continued on treatment for 48 weeks and could then continue to receive study drug through an extension phase. After switching to Biktarvy, 91% (20/22) of participants remained virologically suppressed at Week 24, and the mean change in CD4 % from baseline was 0.2%. HIV-1 RNA was not collected at Week 24 for two participants because of COVID-19 pandemic-related study disruption. In pediatric studies, no new adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities were identified compared to those observed in adults.

Biktarvy does not cure HIV or AIDS.

<b>About Pediatric HIV</b>

While there have been many advances in the treatment of HIV in children and adolescents, there still remains a need to prioritize, evaluate and develop options for the nearly 3 million children worldwide under the age of 19 living with HIV. An estimated 120,000 children and adolescents died from AIDS-related causes in 2020. About 72 percent of these mostly preventable deaths occurred among children under 10 years old. Newer, child-friendly formulations with appropriate dosing for children and adolescents represent an unmet need that is an important part of the considerations associated with long-term health and wellness for people who will live with HIV for their entire lives until we find a cure. Gilead has partnered with a number of global organizations and initiatives to ensure that we are optimizing and closing treatment gaps for children and adolescents in need so that ultimately, we can end the epidemic.

<b>About Biktarvy</b>

Biktarvy is a complete HIV-1 treatment that combines 3 powerful medicines to form the smallest 3-drug, integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based single-tablet regimen (STR) available, offering simple once-daily dosing with or without food, with a limited drug interaction potential and a high barrier to resistance. Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted INSTI bictegravir, with the Descovy<sup>®</sup> (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg tablets, F/TAF) backbone. Biktarvy is a complete single-tablet regimen and should not be taken with other HIV-1 medicines.

In February 2018, the U.S. FDA approved Biktarvy (bictegravir 50 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg tablets, B/F/TAF) as a once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. In June 2019, the FDA approved labeling revisions to Biktarvy, expanding the patient population to include pediatric patients weighing at least 25 kg. In October 2021, the FDA approved a new low-dose tablet formulation of Biktarvy (bictegravir 30 mg/emtricitabine 120 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 15 mg tablets) for pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg to less than 25 kg. For all patient populations, Biktarvy is only indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in people who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of Biktarvy.

<p align=""justify"">Calithera Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: CALA), a clinical-stage, precision oncology biopharmaceutical company, today announced an agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) to acquire two clinical-stage compounds, both of which have demonstrated single-agent clinical activity with the greatest potential in biomarker-defined cancer-patient populations. The compounds, sapanisertib (CB-228, formerly TAK-228) and mivavotinib (CB-659, formerly TAK-659), further strengthen Calithera’s pipeline of clinical-stage targeted therapies.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We believe that these clinical-stage compounds are an excellent complement to our internally-developed pipeline programs, and fit well with our current strategic focus on biomarker-driven therapeutic approaches. We are encouraged by the promising single-agent clinical data that suggest these investigational therapies could help transform treatment for multiple cancer patient populations with high unmet need,” said Susan Molineaux, PhD, president and chief executive officer of Calithera. “Specifically, sapanisertib has the potential to be the first targeted treatment for patients with NRF2-mutated squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We have learned a great deal about the unmet medical need of patients with KEAP1/NRF2 mutations, as well as how to identify and recruit these patients, during the conduct of our KEAPSAKE trial evaluating telaglenastat. This complementary approach in KEAP1/NRF2-mutant squamous NSCLC demonstrates our commitment to these patients and the pathway.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Additionally, mivavotinib has the potential to be a best-in-class SYK inhibitor in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as well as a first-to-market approach for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma whose tumors harbor MyD88 and/or CD79 mutations.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We plan to start a clinical trial in squamous NSCLC with sapanisertib and a clinical trial in DLBCL with mivavotinib, both in biomarker specific populations, and generate data in the next 12 to 18 months that will define the clinical development and potential regulatory approval paths for both of these compounds.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The terms of the transaction include a total upfront cash payment to Takeda of $10 million and $35 million issued to Takeda in Calithera Series A preferred stock. Additionally, Takeda will be eligible to receive from Calithera clinical development, regulatory and sales milestone payments across both programs. Calithera will pay tiered royalties of high single-digits to low teens on future net sales should these candidates achieve regulatory approvals and subsequent commercial availability.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Collaboration is an important aspect of our R&amp;D strategy and at the center of our efforts to deliver new treatment options to patients. We are confident that Calithera, with their highly capable and experienced team, is the ideal partner to resume the development of sapanisertib and mivavotinib, and to maximize their potential to address underserved patient populations,” said Christopher Arendt, Ph.D., head of Oncology Cell Therapy and Therapeutic Area Unit of Takeda. “We look forward to seeing how these programs advance under Calithera’s leadership.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Sapanisertib is a dual TORC 1/2 inhibitor that targets a key survival mechanism in KEAP1/NRF2-mutated tumor cells. These mutations are found in a considerable sub-population of patients across multiple solid tumor types. Sapanisertib has demonstrated promising single-agent activity in patients with relapsed/refractory NRF2-mutated squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and exhibits differential anti-tumor activity compared to rapalog inhibitors of TORC1 in NRF2-mutant squamous NSCLC <em>in vivo</em> models. A Phase 2 study planned to begin in the first quarter of 2022 will further evaluate sapanisertib as a monotherapy in patients with squamous NSCLC harboring a NRF2 mutation.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Mivavotinib is a SYK inhibitor that targets the constitutively active BCR pathway in many non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) cases as well as the constitutively active inflammatory signaling pathway in MyD88-mutated NHL. In early phase studies, mivavotinib showed promising single-agent responses in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In addition, recent preclinical studies have shown enhanced SYK activity and sensitivity to SYK inhibition in DLBCL and other NHLs harboring mutations in MyD88 and/or CD79, which comprise a distinct genetic subset of DLBCL known to have poor outcomes with standard-of-care therapy. Accordingly, Calithera plans to initiate a Phase 2 study of mivavotinib in 2022 for the treatment of patients with DLBCL with and without mutations in MyD88 and CD79. Beyond DLBCL, both preclinical and clinical data support expansion across additional NHL subtypes and other hematologic malignancies as part of long-term plans.</p>

Adults with type 2 diabetes with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk experienced superior A1C and body weight reductions from baseline across all three doses of tirzepatide compared to titrated insulin glargine in detailed results from Eli Lilly and Company's (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tirzepatide-results-published-in-the-lancet-show-superior-a1c-and-body-weight-reductions-compared-to-insulin-glargine-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-with-increased-cardiovascular-risk-301402843.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">LLY</a>) SURPASS-4 clinical trial, which were published today in <i><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3326402-1&amp;h=3247659201&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flancet%2Farticle%2FPIIS0140-6736(21)02188-7%2Ffulltext&amp;a=The+Lancet"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Lancet</a></i>. At 52 weeks, the highest dose of tirzepatide led to an A1C reduction of 2.58 percent and reduced body weight by 11.7 kg (-25.8 lb., -13.0 percent) compared to results for those treated with insulin glargine (A1C reduction of 1.44 percent and weight gain of 1.9 kg [+4.2 lb., +2.2 percent]) for the efficacy estimand.<sup>i,1</sup>

SURPASS-4 is the largest and longest clinical trial completed to date of the phase 3 program studying tirzepatide as a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint was measured at 52 weeks, with participants continuing treatment up to 104 weeks or until study completion. The completion of the study was triggered by the accrual of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) to assess CV risk. In newly published data from the treatment period after 52 weeks, participants taking tirzepatide maintained A1C and weight control for up to two years.

The overall safety profile of tirzepatide, assessed over the full study period, was consistent with the safety results measured at 52 weeks, with no new findings up to 104 weeks. Gastrointestinal side effects were the most commonly reported adverse events, usually occurring during the escalation period and then decreasing over time.

""We are encouraged by the continued A1C and weight control that participants experienced past the initial 52 week treatment period and up to two years as we continue to explore the potential impact of tirzepatide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">John Doupis</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Director, Diabetes Division and Clinical Research Center, Iatriko Paleou Falirou Medical Center, <span class=""xn-location"">Athens, Greece</span> and Senior Investigator for SURPASS-4.

Tirzepatide is a novel investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single molecule, representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

SURPASS-4 was an open-label global trial comparing the safety and efficacy of three tirzepatide doses (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) to titrated insulin glargine in 2,002 adults with type 2 diabetes with increased CV risk who were treated with between one and three oral antihyperglycemic medicines (metformin, a sulfonylurea or an SGLT-2 inhibitor). Of the total participants randomized, 1,819 (91%) completed the primary 52-week visit and 1,706 (85%) completed the study on treatment. The median study duration was 85 weeks and 202 participants (10%) completed two years.

Study participants had a mean duration of diabetes of 11.8 years, a baseline A1C of 8.52 percent and a baseline weight of 90.3 kg. More than 85 percent of participants had a history of cardiovascular events. In the insulin glargine arm, the insulin dose was titrated following a treat-to-target algorithm with the goal of fasting blood glucose below 100 mg/dL. The starting dose of insulin glargine was 10 units per day, and the mean dose of insulin glargine at 52 weeks was 43.5 units per day.

SURPASS-4 achieved each of its primary and key secondary endpoints. All three doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) led to statistically significant and superior A1C and body weight reductions compared to insulin glargine for both estimands<sup>ii </sup>at 52 weeks (the primary endpoint). Specifically, the efficacy estimand results showed:
<ul>
 	<li>A1C reduction: -2.24% (5 mg), -2.43% (10 mg), -2.58% (15 mg), -1.44% (insulin glargine)</li>
 	<li>Weight change: -7.1 kg (-8.1%, 5 mg), -9.5 kg (-10.7%, 10 mg), -11.7 kg (-13.0%, 15 mg), +1.9 kg (+2.2%, insulin glargine)</li>
 	<li>Percent of participants achieving A1C &lt;7%: 81% (5 mg), 88% (10 mg), 91% (15 mg), 51% (insulin glargine)</li>
 	<li>Percent of participants achieving A1C &lt;5.7% (not controlled for type 1 error): 23% (5 mg), 33% (10 mg), 43% (15 mg), 3% (insulin glargine)</li>
</ul>
For the treatment-regimen estimand<sup>iii</sup>, all three doses of tirzepatide led to superior A1C and weight reductions at 52 weeks. Specifically, results showed:
<ul>
 	<li>A1C reduction: -2.11% (5 mg), -2.30% (10 mg), -2.41% (15 mg), -1.39% (insulin glargine)</li>
 	<li>Weight change: -6.4 kg (5 mg), -8.9 kg (10 mg), -10.6 kg (15 mg), +1.7 kg (insulin glargine)</li>
 	<li>Percent of participants achieving A1C &lt;7%: 75% (5 mg), 83% (10 mg), 85% (15 mg), 49% (insulin glargine)</li>
</ul>
Participants taking tirzepatide maintained A1C and weight control for up to two years in exploratory analyses.
<ul>
 	<li>The mean A1C values at 52 and 104 weeks were:
<ul>
 	<li>At 52 weeks (N=1,750): 6.3% (5 mg), 6.1% (10 mg), 6.0% (15 mg), 7.1% (insulin glargine)</li>
 	<li>At 104 weeks (N=199): 6.4% (5 mg), 6.1% (10 mg), 6.1% (15 mg), 7.5% (insulin glargine)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>The changes in body weight at 52 and 104 weeks were:
<ul>
 	<li>At 52 weeks (N=1,755): -7.1 kg (-8.1%, 5 mg), -9.5 kg (-10.7%, 10 mg), -11.7 kg (-13.0%, 15 mg), +1.9 kg (+2.2%, insulin glargine)</li>
 	<li>At 104 weeks (N=202): -5.8 kg (-8.6%, 5 mg), -10.4 kg (-10.8%, 10 mg), -11.1 kg (-12.8%, 15 mg), +2.3 kg (+2.3%, insulin glargine)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Hypoglycemia less than 54 mg/dL was reported in 8.8 percent (5 mg), 6.1 percent (10 mg) and 8.0 percent (15 mg) of participants in the tirzepatide arms and in 19.1 percent of participants in the insulin glargine arm over the full study period. Episodes of hypoglycemia were seen more often in participants who had a background therapy of a sulfonylurea.

In an additional exploratory endpoint, all three doses of tirzepatide led to favorable changes from baseline in fasting lipids at 52 weeks. Specifically, at the highest dose of tirzepatide (15 mg): total cholesterol was reduced by 5.6 percent, triglycerides were reduced by 22.5 percent, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was reduced by 7.9 percent, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol was reduced by 21.8 percent, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was increased by 10.8 percent.

The most commonly reported adverse events over the full study period in the tirzepatide arms were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity. For study participants treated with tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively), nausea (12 percent, 16 percent, 23 percent), diarrhea (13 percent, 20 percent, 22 percent) and vomiting (5 percent, 8 percent, 9 percent) were more frequently experienced compared to insulin glargine (2 percent [nausea], 4 percent [diarrhea], 2 percent [vomiting]). Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events over the full study period were 7.3 percent (tirzepatide 5 mg), 7.9 percent (tirzepatide 10 mg) and 8.9 percent (tirzepatide 15 mg), compared to 1.9 percent (insulin glargine).

A safety analysis evaluated adjudicated MACE-4, a composite endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalization for unstable angina. Within SURPASS-4, comparing pooled tirzepatide to insulin glargine, no increased cardiovascular risk was identified with tirzepatide; a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.51 to 1.08) was observed.

""Given the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, evaluating the positive efficacy results we have seen with tirzepatide over longer periods of time is important. Throughout the length of SURPASS-4, tirzepatide delivered robust improvements in blood glucose levels, significant weight loss and consistent safety results in adults with type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jeff Emmick</span>, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development.

<b>About tirzepatide<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Tirzepatide is a once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single novel molecule. GIP is a hormone that may complement the effects of GLP-1. In preclinical models, GIP has been shown to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure therefore resulting in weight reductions, and when combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, may result in greater effects on glucose and body weight. Tirzepatide is in phase 3 development for blood glucose management in adults with type 2 diabetes, for chronic weight management and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). It is also being studied as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

<b>About SURPASS-4 and the SURPASS clinical trial program<br class=""dnr"" /></b>SURPASS-4 (NCT03730662) is a randomized, parallel, open-label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg to insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with at least one and up to three oral antihyperglycemic medications (metformin, sulfonylureas or SGLT-2 inhibitors), who have increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. The trial randomized 2,002 study participants in a 1:1:1:3 ratio to receive either tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg or insulin glargine. Participants were located in the European Union, <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span> (<span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>), <span class=""xn-location"">Australia</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Israel</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Taiwan</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Latin America</span> (<span class=""xn-location"">Brazil</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Argentina</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Mexico</span>). The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that tirzepatide (10 mg and/or 15 mg) is non-inferior to insulin glargine for change from baseline A1C at 52 weeks in people with type 2 diabetes and increased CV risk. The primary and key secondary endpoints were measured at 52 weeks, with participants continuing treatment up to 104 weeks or until study completion. The completion of the study was triggered by the accrual of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Study participants enrolled had to have a mean baseline A1C between 7.5 percent and 10.5 percent and a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at baseline. All participants in the tirzepatide treatment arms started the study at a dose of tirzepatide 2.5 mg once-weekly and then increased the dose in a step-wise approach at four-week intervals to their final randomized maintenance dose of 5 mg (via a 2.5 mg step), 10 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 7.5 mg) or 15 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg and 12.5 mg). All participants in the titrated insulin glargine treatment arm started with a baseline dose of 10 units per day and titrated following a treat-to-target algorithm to reach a fasting blood glucose below 100 mg/dL.

The SURPASS phase 3 global clinical development program for tirzepatide has enrolled more than 20,000 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, five of which are global registration studies. The program began in late 2018, and all five global registration trials have been completed.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has issued a Final Appraisal Determination (FAD) recommending Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab), as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma.<sup>1* </sup>(Full details <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">below</a> and recommendation <a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/consultations/874/1/recommendations"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">here</a>)

We know that every ten seconds someone in the UK has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack,<sup>6</sup> with approximately 77,000 people being hospitalised each year<sup>7</sup> despite severe asthma being treatable. Now that a new treatment option is available, this is good news for the 200,000 people living with severe asthma in the UK.<sup>8</sup>
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><i>""Living with severe, uncontrolled asthma results is a constant struggle with shortness of breath and wheezing, making it very hard to lead a normal life. It can be life threatening when medications are unable to keep asthma under control and severe asthma attacks are too often a reality,"" said Professor <span class=""xn-person"">Ian Pavord</span>, Professor of Respiratory Medicine, Respiratory Medicine Unit and Oxford Respiratory NIHR BRC, Nuffield Department of Medicine, <span class=""xn-org"">University of Oxford</span>. ""Providing patients with new treatment options is particularly important during the ongoing pandemic as people with severe asthma feel especially vulnerable. Biologic treatments, such as dupilumab, which target one of the dominant underlying causes of severe asthma, can transform outcomes for people with severe asthma.""</i></p>
Dupilumab acts on the type 2 immune response which is believed to be a major driver in severe asthma. Dupilumab is different to many existing treatments as it works by dampening down two key drivers of the inflammatory process - interlukin-4 and interlukin-13.<sup>2</sup> In severe asthma patients with type 2 inflammation it has been shown, to reduce severe asthma attacks by up to 67% compared to placebo (0.40 exacerbation rate versus 1.24 exacerbation rate), and hospitalisations/A&amp;E visits by nearly 50% compared to placebo (0.035 hospitalisation rate versus 0.065 hospitalisation rate).<sup>2</sup><sup> </sup>

In addition to reducing asthma attacks and hospitalisations/A&amp;E visits, in clinical trials, dupilumab also improved lung function (FEV1) in patients with type 2 inflammation by up to 250mls compared to placebo.<sup>2</sup> Furthermore, dupilumab eliminated the need to use oral corticosteroids in 52% (51 patients) of OCS-dependent patients with type 2 inflammation (compared to 29% (27 patients) with placebo).<sup>3</sup><sup> </sup>

The publication date of NICE Final Guidance for the use of dupilumab within NHS England for treating severe asthma is anticipated in early December. Dupilumab will be made available through NHS England within three months from the date of publication.

<b>About the LIBERTY ASTHMA clinical programme and type 2 inflammation<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The LIBERTY ASTHMA clinical programme evaluated 2,888 adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older). All trials enrolled eligible asthma patients irrespective of minimum baseline type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, such as eosinophils or fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels.<sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>3</sup>

The NICE FAD is based on a subset of patients taking part in the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST clinical trial, with high exacerbation rates and high biomarkers indicating type 2 inflammation.<sup> </sup>

The type 2 immune response is believed to be a major driver in severe asthma. Uncontrolled severe asthma is mainly driven by type 2 inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-13 (IL-13) and interleukin-5 (IL-5), which contribute to common asthma phenotypes including eosinophilic, allergic and mixed.<sup>9,10,11</sup>

<b>About Dupilumab<br class=""dnr"" /></b>NICE have made a recommendation on the use of dupilumab in severe asthma. Visit the NICE website for more information on the dupilumab recommendation: <a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/consultations/874/1/recommendations"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.nice.org.uk/consultations/874/1/recommendations</a>

The patient population includes a group with type 2 inflammation defined by raised blood eosinophils of 150 cells per microlitre or more and a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) of 25 or more that are currently not eligible for other biologics under NICE guidance, and therefore represents a significant unmet need. For patients who have failed to respond adequately to other biologic treatment according to NICE guidance, the reimbursed patient population will allow subsequent treatment with dupilumab.

Those patients who fulfil dupilumab licensed posology for 300 mg dosing are excluded from the reimbursed population.<sup>1</sup>

Dupilumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signalling of IL-4 and IL-13, two key proteins that play a central role in the type 2 inflammation that underlies specific types of asthma, as well as several other allergic diseases. This effect is associated with the reduction of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers (compared to placebo) including FeNO, immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eotaxin-3 (CCL26).<sup>12,13</sup>

Dupilumab is licensed as an add-on maintenance treatment for people with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional FeNO who are inadequately controlled with high dose inhaled corticosteroid plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.<sup>14</sup> For further information please see the latest Dupilumab SmPC here: <a href=""https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/11321/smpc#gref"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/11321/smpc#gref</a>

<p align=""left"">Sana Biotechnology, Inc. (NASDAQ: SANA), a company focused on creating and delivering engineered cells as medicines, today announced that the company entered into an agreement with Beam Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BEAM) for non-exclusive commercial rights to Beam’s CRISPR Cas12b nuclease system for certain <em>ex vivo</em> engineered cell therapy programs.</p>
Cas12b is a CRISPR-based nuclease with a high degree of specificity and efficiency that can be used to knock out and/or knock in genes in certain cell types. Under the agreement, Beam granted Sana non-exclusive rights to utilize its Cas12b system with certain allogeneic T cell and stem cell-derived programs, including the ability to make gene edits for Sana’s hypoimmune platform. The license does not include any rights to base editing using Cas12b, which remain at Beam.

“Gene editing technology is a key component in developing engineered cells as medicines, and we are pleased to have the ability to use the Cas12b system as part of a number of our <em>ex vivo </em>engineered cell programs,” said Steve Harr, Sana’s President and CEO. “The specificity and efficiency of Cas12b make it appealing for Sana’s allogeneic T cell as well as gene-edited pluripotent stem cell programs. We intend to incorporate this platform into multiple product candidates, with the first IND filed as early as next year.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Sana agreed to pay Beam an upfront payment of $50 million. Beam is also eligible to receive certain target option exercise fees, certain milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development and sales milestones, and certain royalties on net sales of royalty-bearing products by Sana, its affiliates, its sublicensees and affiliates of its sublicensees.

Antios Therapeutics, Inc. and Assembly Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/antios-therapeutics-and-assembly-biosciences-announce-clinical-collaboration-agreement-to-evaluate-the-combination-of-ati-2173-and-vebicorvir-in-patients-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-301402876.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">ASMB</a>) today announced that the companies have entered into a clinical collaboration agreement to evaluate a triple combination treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. A single cohort in the ongoing Antios Phase 2a ANTT201 clinical trial will evaluate ATI-2173, Antios' investigational proprietary active site polymerase inhibitor nucleotide (ASPIN), vebicorvir (VBR), Assembly Bio's investigational lead core inhibitor candidate, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

The multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cohort will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of this all-oral triple combination. This cohort is expected to start in the first half of 2022 and will enroll 10 treatment naïve or off-treatment HBeAg negative or positive patients in a 12-week treatment study.

""Antios is focused on developing a functional cure for people living with chronic HBV. ATI-2173 has, to date, demonstrated a generally well-tolerated safety profile, leveraging a unique ASPIN mechanism in clinical development to empower combination therapy. Ultimately, ATI-2173 has the potential to become a cornerstone of a once-daily curative regimen in combination with other agents, like vebicorvir, for the treatment of chronic HBV,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Gregory Mayes</span>, Chief Executive Officer of Antios.

""Our collaboration with Antios emphasizes our commitment to evaluating the backbone of our core inhibitors plus a nucleos(t)ide analogue in combination with other mechanisms to treat HBV, a cause of chronic infection that can lead to a higher risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">John McHutchison</span>, AO, MD, Chief Executive Officer and President of Assembly Bio. ""The commitment that we and Antios share to pursue finite and curative therapies for HBV unites us in these research efforts and offers hope for patients.""

<b>About ATI-2173<br class=""dnr"" /></b>ATI-2173, Antios Therapeutics' lead once-daily, oral drug candidate for treating HBV, is an investigational phosphoramidate prodrug of clevudine monophosphate. ATI-2173 has the potential, if approved, to become the cornerstone of a curative HBV regimen. It is the only Active Site Polymerase Inhibitor Nucleotide (ASPIN) in clinical development and its mechanism of action is designed to be complementary to other approaches that also seek to achieve a functional cure. ATI-2173 is currently in Phase 2 clinical development. The <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3327336-1&amp;h=2873736847&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04847440&amp;a=SAVE-1+(Sustained+Anti-Viral+Efficacy)"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">SAVE-1 (Sustained Anti-Viral Efficacy)</a> trial is an ongoing, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 30 adult patients designed to assess the safety and efficacy of 25 and 50 mg doses of ATI-2173 daily for 90 days in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) compared with TDF plus ATI-placebo (control) in chronic HBV-infected subjects.

<b>About Vebicorvir, Assembly Bio's Lead HBV Core Inhibitor<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Assembly Bio's HBV portfolio includes three investigational small molecule candidates, all of which are HBV core inhibitors that target multiple steps of the HBV replication cycle. In Phase 2 clinical trials, first-generation core inhibitor vebicorvir (VBR) administered with nucleos(t)ide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NrtI) therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile and led to greater viral suppression of both HBV DNA and HBV pgRNA than NrtI therapy alone. VBR is advancing in multiple Phase 2 combination studies.

<b>About HBV<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a debilitating disease of the liver that affects approximately 270 million people worldwide with up to 90 million people in China, as estimated by the World Health Organization. HBV is a global epidemic that affects more people than hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infection combined—with a higher morbidity and mortality rate. HBV is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and need for liver transplantation, and up to one million people worldwide die every year from HBV-related causes.

The current standard of care for patients with chronic HBV infection is life-long suppressive treatment with medications that reduce, but do not eliminate, the virus, resulting in very low cure rates. There is a significant unmet need for new therapies to treat HBV.

<b>About Antios Therapeutics, Inc.<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Antios Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of innovative therapies to treat and cure viral diseases. Its lead drug candidate ATI-2173 – the only Active Site Polymerase Inhibitor Nucleotide (ASPIN) in clinical development – has the potential, if approved, to become the cornerstone of a curative therapeutic regimen for chronic HBV, a major unmet global health problem affecting up to 300 million people worldwide, more than hepatitis C and HIV combined.

<p align=""justify"">Oxford Biomedica plc (LSE:OXB) (“Oxford Biomedica” or “the Group”), a leading gene and cell therapy group, today announces that Boehringer Ingelheim has exercised its option to license Oxford Biomedica’s lentiviral vector technology to manufacture, register and commercialise BI 3720931, a lentiviral vector-based gene therapy for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF).</p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the terms of the option and license agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, originally announced in <a title=""August 2018"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PriOjc4irFdaQK4czTzVH9WGmTk-IUaa0mlwqvCKvn1PyiSkhVrZORMEE2xAwrDxTrSOOQ9CEbUSzXHyOiYLRLC_O98k9xlCvfsbCUDqSuEp0T1SRoxgOuQ-H7370bW3tj1CPraI3TsJZyb-EqTQEz1NN1PjUUAfkiydJt7tpcx6RqkzQ9BLTKDU5AFZVmda"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">August 2018</a>, Boehringer Ingelheim will pay Oxford Biomedica an option exercise fee of £3.5 million. Oxford Biomedica is further entitled to development, regulatory and sales milestones of up to a further £27.5 million, in addition to a tiered low single digit royalty on net sales of a CF gene therapy product. This option exercise by Boehringer Ingelheim follows on another recent signature of a Development &amp; Supply Agreement which was announced in April 2021, relating to the clinical manufacture of various types of viral vector based products.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In parallel, Boehringer Ingelheim has also exercised its option to license intellectual property and know-how from IP Group and the UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium relating to the same lentiviral vector-based product candidate for the treatment of CF.</p>
<p align=""justify"">This innovative development partnership between academia, Pharma and Biotech focuses on the development of a novel, replication deficient lentiviral vector, in an inhaled formulation, to selectively introduce a CFTR gene into the relevant target cell. This approach has demonstrated high gene transfer efficiency and offers the possibility of repeated administration to maintain a therapeutic effect. In addition, the approach has the potential to address all of the more than 2,000 different known gene mutations across CF patients, and therefore offers a gene-independent disease-modifying treatment option for patients.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Should the program progress into clinical development, Oxford Biomedica expects to produce large quantities of lentiviral vectors using its highly efficient GMP-compliant manufacturing process in bioreactors.</p>

Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVIR) (“Atea”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today reported that the global Phase 2 MOONSONG trial evaluating AT-527 in the outpatient setting did not meet the primary endpoint of reduction from baseline in the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 compared to placebo in the overall study population, of which approximately two thirds of patients were low-risk with mild symptoms. However, in high-risk patients with underlying health conditions, a reduction of viral load of approximately 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> at Day 7 was observed at 550 mg (prespecified subgroup analysis) and 1,100 mg BID (exploratory subgroup analysis) compared with placebo.

Based on the MOONSONG topline and additional recent results for AT-527 as well as the evolving COVID-19 environment, Atea, together with Roche, are assessing potential modifications to the global Phase 3 MORNINGSKY trial including the trial’s primary endpoint and patient population. As a result, we now anticipate Phase 3 MORNINGSKY data in the second half of 2022.

“The primary endpoint was not achieved in the overall study population in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19, however, MOONSONG topline data suggest that AT-527 has antiviral activity in high-risk patients with underlying health conditions as we previously reported in the Phase 2 hospitalized study. Based on these and other AT-527 data, we with our partner Roche, are assessing potential modifications to the Phase 3 MORNINGSKY protocol that may likely lead to improved clinical outcomes,” said Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Atea Pharmaceuticals. “We remain committed to our goal of developing and delivering AT-527 as an oral antiviral that will address treatment needs as COVID-19 continues to evolve.”

Atea and Roche are jointly developing AT-527 as an oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) for the treatment of COVID-19. Its unique mechanism of action, with dual targets including chain termination (RdRp) and NiRAN inhibition, has the potential to create a high barrier to resistance with broad antiviral coverage to different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Atea has completed a comprehensive nonclinical program to characterize the safety profile of AT-527. Results from these nonclinical studies demonstrate that AT-527 is non-mutagenic and has no effects on fertility and reproduction.

<strong>Topline Results of Global Phase 2 MOONSONG Trial of AT-527 in the Outpatient Setting</strong>

The global Phase 2 MOONSONG trial is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled trial, evaluating the antiviral activity, safety and pharmacokinetics of AT-527 550 mg (Cohort A, n=30) and 1,100 mg (Cohort B, n=30) administered twice daily (BID) in adult patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 versus placebo (n=40). The primary endpoint of this virology trial, which enrolled patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive, is change from baseline in amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA as measured by RT-PCR at specified timepoints.

In the topline analysis, treatment with AT-527 did not meet the primary endpoint as it did not show a clear reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the overall population of patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 compared to placebo. Overall, approximately two-thirds of the patients had mild symptoms with no underlying health conditions and were on average 37 years old. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccinated patients were among the patients included in the overall study population.

In high-risk patients with underlying health conditions, a reduction of viral load of approximately 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> at Day 7 was observed with administration of 550 mg as compared to placebo (prespecified subgroup analysis Cohort A n=7; placebo n=11) and with administration of 1,100 mg BID as compared to placebo (exploratory subgroup analysis Cohort B; n=14; placebo n=7).

In addition to baseline patient characteristics, several factors may have impacted the MOONSONG data results, which evaluated viral kinetics. These potential factors include different variants emerging during the study, greater penetration of vaccinations within the enrolled population and a pooled placebo patient population. The pooled placebo patient population included different vaccination status (varying doses and vaccine types) and may have included different COVID-19 variants.

Consistent with previous studies, AT-527 was generally safe and well tolerated. In the MOONSONG study, the proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event (AE) was 20% in the placebo group, 20% in the AT-527 550 mg BID group (Cohort A) and 27% in the AT-527 1100 mg BID group (Cohort B). There were 3 non-drug related serious adverse events (SAEs) in each of the treatment groups and all other AEs were grade 1 or 2. Gastrointestinal (GI)-related AEs were the most commonly reported AEs: 8% in the placebo group; 7% in the AT-527 550 mg BID group (Cohort A); 17% in the AT-527 1100 mg BID group (Cohort B), with mild to moderate nausea/vomiting resulting in premature study drug discontinuation of 3% in the placebo group, 0% in the AT-527 550 mg BID group (Cohort A) and 17% in the AT-527 1100 mg BID group (Cohort B). No clinically significant differences in laboratory abnormalities were observed in the treatment arms as compared to placebo.

“Based on the totality of the results for AT-527 to-date, the current level of understanding of the virus and the evolving COVID-19 environment, we are assessing the Phase 3 MORNINGSKY trial for modifications to ensure the best possible outcome for the program,” said Janet Hammond, MD, PhD, Chief Development Officer of Atea Pharmaceuticals. “We, along with our partner Roche, are continuing to advance multiple studies in parallel to provide further clinical evidence as well as outcome data to support AT-527 as an oral, potent, direct-acting antiviral treatment for COVID-19.”

In addition to the MOONSONG results announced today, results from the bronchoalveolar lavage study and Phase 2 hospitalized trial are being presented at the International Society for Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus Diseases (ISIRV)-World Health Organization Virtual Conference (WHO), in a poster and oral session held virtually October 19-21, 2021.

<strong>About the AT-527 COVID-19 Clinical Development Program</strong>

Derived from Atea’s nucleos(t)ide prodrug platform, AT-527 is an oral direct-acting antiviral which is being studied to determine its potential to protect against disease progression, and the development of long-COVID complications. Its mechanism of action, with dual targets against a key viral enzyme, enhances its potential to limit resistance and work across variants. In collaboration with Roche, Atea is evaluating AT-527 across multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials that are advancing in parallel, including the global Phase 3 MORNINGSKY trial, a global Phase 2 study in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19, and the global Phase 2 MOONSONG virology study in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. In addition, MEADOWSPRING, a global Phase 3 long-term follow-on study, is evaluating the impact of AT-527 on long-term sequelae of COVID-19 in patients previously enrolled in MORNINGSKY.

Nedosiran demonstrated safety and tolerability results in this trial consistent with previously reported studies in the PHYOX clinical development program. Patients administered nedosiran also showed a trend in urinary oxalate (Uox) reduction; however, these reductions did not meet prespecified secondary efficacy endpoint criteria. Dicerna plans to submit an NDA to the FDA for nedosiran for the treatment of PH1 in the fourth quarter of 2021.

“The favorable safety and tolerability results, coupled with the encouraging trends in Uox reduction observed in the first clinical trial of any investigational therapy in patients with PH3, provide important initial data for nedosiran in PH3,” said Shreeram Aradhye, M.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Dicerna. “While we have refined our near-term nedosiran strategy primarily to focus on the treatment of PH1, there is a significant unmet medical need in PH3, and we plan to analyze these data further as part of our discussions to out-license the commercialization of nedosiran. I would like to extend our sincere thanks to the patients, caregivers, investigators and their staff involved in the PHYOX4 study for their important contributions.”

The PHYOX4 trial (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04555486%3Fterm%3Dnedosiran%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&amp;esheet=52511255&amp;newsitemid=20211019005355&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT04555486&amp;index=2&amp;md5=a6c7520efaecc09532db866670d107af"" rel=""nofollow"">NCT04555486</a>) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of a single subcutaneous dose of nedosiran compared to placebo in patients with PH3 who had at least one kidney stone event in the prior 12 months (nedosiran n=4; placebo n=2). All reported adverse events (AEs) were mild and unrelated to nedosiran treatment. The most commonly reported AE was back pain. No serious AEs were reported in the study.

No subjects in either group achieved the prespecified secondary efficacy endpoint, which was a greater than 30% decrease from baseline in 24-hour Uox excretion on at least two consecutive visits over the three-month observation period. However, all patients administered a single dose of nedosiran demonstrated Uox reductions relative to baseline at one or more time points during the three-month period.

<b>About Primary Hyperoxaluria (PH)</b>

Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a family of ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorders that initially manifest with complications in the kidneys. There are three known subtypes of PH (PH1, PH2 and PH3), each resulting from a mutation in one of three different genes. These genetic mutations cause enzyme deficiencies that result in the overproduction of oxalate, which is an end-product of metabolism. Excess production and accumulation of oxalate leads to recurrent kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis and chronic kidney disease that may progress to end-stage renal disease requiring intensive dialysis. Compromised renal function eventually results in the accumulation of oxalate in a wide range of organs including the skin, bones, eyes and heart. In the most severe cases, symptoms start in the first year of life. A combined liver-kidney transplant may be undertaken to resolve PH1 or PH2, but it is an invasive solution with limited availability and high morbidity that requires lifelong immune suppression to prevent organ rejection. Genetic studies suggest approximately 8,500 people in the U.S. are affected by PH, and researchers estimate that more than 80% of patients remain undiagnosed.<sup>1</sup> There is currently only one approved therapy available that is limited to the treatment of patients with PH1.

<b>About Nedosiran</b>

Nedosiran is in development for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria (PH) as part of the PHYOX clinical development program and is Dicerna’s most advanced RNAi drug candidate utilizing our proprietary GalXC RNAi technology. Nedosiran is designed to inhibit production of the hepatic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme – an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the glyoxylate metabolism pathway that can lead to oxalate overproduction in patients with PH.

SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SWTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing medicines for patients with severe rare diseases and cancer, today announced that it has entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Dana-Farber) and a sponsored research agreement (SRA) with Stanford Medicine for a portfolio of novel small molecule inhibitors of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) designed for the treatment of <em>EGFR</em>-mutant lung cancers. The portfolio, which was originally developed in the laboratory of Nathanael Gray, Ph.D., Professor of Chemical and Systems Biology, Co-Director of Cancer Drug Discovery, and Co-Leader of the Cancer Therapeutics Research Program at Stanford Medicine, includes several differentiated, first-in-class chemical series representing novel approaches to targeting mutant EGFR and is designed to address both de novo oncogenic drivers and emerging resistance mutations to existing EGFR inhibitors. The most advanced asset in the portfolio is currently in lead optimization and targets the C797S resistance mutation.

“We are very pleased to expand our portfolio with the in-license of these selective and differentiated EGFR inhibitors, which are complementary to our strategy of developing novel targeted therapies for patients with biomarker-defined solid tumors,” said Saqib Islam, Chief Executive Officer of SpringWorks. “In addition to the monotherapy opportunities in lung cancer, where a significant unmet medical need remains, these EGFR inhibitors provide several avenues for combination therapy development as well.”

“Since our lab discovered the initial compounds that could address EGFR T790M mutations, we have been exploring additional strategies to create next-generation agents for patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers in order to address the resistance mutations that inevitably arise upon treatment with osimertinib and other therapies,” said Dr. Gray. “I am grateful for the SRA support from SpringWorks and continued collaboration with my former colleagues at Dana-Farber to further this exciting science with the goal of translating our initial discoveries into meaningful new therapies for cancer patients.”

Under the terms of the license agreement, SpringWorks will provide Dana-Farber with an upfront payment and Dana-Farber will be eligible to receive development and commercial milestones and royalties based on any future net sales. Concurrent with this license, SpringWorks has entered a multi-year SRA to fund continued research and development in Dr. Gray’s laboratory at Stanford Medicine as well as collaborating laboratories at Dana-Farber, including those of Pasi Jänne, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Lowe Center for Thoracic Oncology at Dana-Farber and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Dana-Farber and Harvard Medical School, and Jarrod Marto, Ph.D., Principal Investigator at Dana-Farber and Associate Professor of Pathology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. This SRA is intended to support lead optimization and translational biology efforts as the portfolio advances towards development candidate nomination.

“Drs. Gray, Jänne, Eck and Marto have been pioneers in the discovery and development of precision medicines for cancer patients. Through this license agreement and multi-year research collaboration, we have the opportunity to advance programs at the leading edge of targeted oncology development, potentially delivering first- and best-in-class medicines to address emerging drivers of therapeutic resistance,” said Mike Burgess M.B.Ch.B., Ph.D., Head of Research &amp; Development at SpringWorks.

The agreement was facilitated by Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation.</p>
Under the terms of the agreement, F-star will grant Janssen a worldwide, exclusive royalty-bearing license to research, develop, and commercialize up to five novel bispecific antibodies directed to Janssen therapeutic targets using F-star’s proprietary Fcab™ and mAb<sup>2</sup>™ platforms. Janssen will be responsible for all research, development, and commercialization activities under the agreement.

<strong>Neil Brewis, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer</strong> of F-star said, “We are pleased to collaborate with Janssen and leverage the science of F-star’s proprietary tetravalent bispecific technology. Beyond our proprietary pipeline, we believe there is broad potential for our mAb<sup>2</sup> platform to produce multiple next-generation bispecific antibody therapeutics.”

Under the terms of the agreement F-star is entitled to receive upfront fees of $17.5 million, near-term fees and potential further milestones of up to $1.35 billion. F-star is also eligible to receive potential tiered mid-single digit royalties on annual net sales.

<strong>About F-star’s </strong><strong>Fcab™ and mAb</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><strong>™ Platforms</strong>

F-star's <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qB95rFI9FMroQ_uN289wc-8CCYyLma6HJH3ZwSoUkqu9EYRpLIioyRnz5kzKf-f6cR47REcAP8QQsuerYXzbosOCo8KjJ3D_D5_jOPKJYHlhe44In8rt-WQsqj_Gw1Wh"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">proprietary platform</a> allows substitutions in the Fc region of a natural antibody, creating two additional distinct antigen binding sites. The resulting <strong>Fcab</strong> (<u>Fc</u> with <u>a</u>ntigen <u>b</u>inding) building blocks can be rapidly inserted into a natural IgG antibody format to create tetravalent <strong>mAb</strong><sup><strong>2 </strong></sup>bispecific antibodies that bind, simultaneously, to two different antigens.

F-star's mAb<sup>2</sup> bispecific antibodies are designed to conserve the natural human antibody format, with greater than 95% identity, providing minimal systemic toxicity, low immunogenicity risk, and ease of manufacturability.

Fcab building blocks can be used to generate not only bispecific antibodies but also tri-specific antibodies and fusion proteins.

F-star has 230 granted patents and over 150 pending applications covering its Fcab and mAb<sup>2 </sup>technology and associated product pipeline.

<strong>About F-star Therapeutics, Inc.</strong>

By developing medicines that seek to block tumor immune evasion, the Company’s goal is to offer patients greater and more durable benefits than current immuno-oncology treatments. Through its proprietary tetravalent, bispecific natural antibody (mAb²™) format, F-star’s mission is to generate highly differentiated best-in-class drug candidates with monoclonal antibody-like manufacturability.

<strong>Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</strong>

This press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the ""PSLRA""). Forward-looking statements include statements, other than statements of historical fact, regarding, among other things, statements relating to the broad potential for F-star’s mAb2 platform to produce multiple next-generation bispecific antibody therapeutics, and F-star’s ability to receive milestones of up to $1.35 billion and tiered mid-single digit royalties on annual net sales pursuant to the agreement with Janssen. These include statements regarding management's intentions, plans, beliefs, expectations or forecasts for the future, and, therefore, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them. Such forward-looking statements are based on F-star's expectations and involve risks and uncertainties; consequently, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, risks relating to F-star's status as a clinical stage immuno-oncology company and its need for substantial additional funding in order to complete the development and commercialization of its product candidates, that it may experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of its product candidates, that its clinical trials may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of its product candidates, that results of preclinical studies and early stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later state clinical trials, that F-star faces significant competition in its drug discovery and development efforts, risks from global pandemics including COVID-19, and legislative, regulatory, political and economic developments, as well as those risks identified under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in F-star's filings with the SEC. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for F-star to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements included in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date of this press release.

This collaboration combines BehaVR's design and product development capabilities with Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma's expertise in developing prescription therapeutics for patients with CNS-related disorders. It also leverages key strengths from each company's go-to-market and commercial capabilities. The companies believe the unique neurological power of the virtual reality (VR) medium will transform access to care and power next generation delivery of anxiety and depression treatment for patients. The companies will pursue FDA clearance for three products that aim to alleviate the burden in patients with Social Anxiety, Generalized Anxiety or Major Depressive Disorder. Once FDA-cleared, they may be prescribed alongside other behavioral therapies and have the potential to be used in a variety of settings.

&nbsp;

Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma has agreed to fund development of these novel VR therapies and to commercialize them globally upon achievement of each country's regulatory approvals. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma will pay BehaVR <span class=""xn-money"">$5 million</span> in upfront payments and up to <span class=""xn-money"">$18 million</span> in development milestone and R&amp;D support payments, in addition to commercial and operational support fees. An additional up to <span class=""xn-money"">$140 million</span> in milestone payments are contingent upon commercial success. In addition, BehaVR will receive tiered royalties on global sales of the digital therapeutic products that are delivered into market.

""This continued investment in our collaboration with BehaVR demonstrates Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma's commitment to meet patients' unmet behavioral health needs by developing digital therapies that go beyond pharmacological interventions. There is inadequate access to high quality mental health therapists in every country across the world. Our goal is to deliver high-impact digital VR therapies that are evidence-based to a broad global population of patients that continue to struggle with SAD, GAD, and MDD,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Hiroyuki Baba</span>, Senior Executive Officer, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma.  ""We are excited and proud to be pioneering the use of this fast-moving new medium of Virtual Reality to develop treatments for anxiety and depression related mental illnesses. I could not be more pleased with this extension to our important partnership with BehaVR, who share our vision of the impact that these new products will make.""

According to numerous reports by the National Institutes of Health, Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, anxiety levels are rising with over 19% of US adults suffering from an anxiety disorder and 5% of adults suffering from depression worldwide. The global COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the issues. Both depression and anxiety are major contributors to the overall global burden of disease and rise of substance abuse. The treatment gap between the number of people with mental disorders and the number treated represents a major public health challenge. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and BehaVR believe that new approaches are needed to address these conditions, including commercializing the 20-year body of research that shows that the application of VR can be used in support of better patient outcomes.

""In my opinion, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma is one of the most forward thinking and innovative pharmaceutical companies in the world today. We are thrilled to deepen our relationship to jointly increase our impact on health via clinically validated, FDA-cleared Virtual Reality-based digital therapies. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma's clinical and commercial expertise in this space will advance our joint objective of successfully scaling effective treatment options for anxiety and depression,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Aaron Gani</span>, Founder and CEO of BehaVR.

""Together we are innovating at the vanguard of digital therapeutics and early clinician, patient and consumer responses are extremely favorable. We believe this deep partnership between a global pharmaceutical company Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and VR digital therapeutics leader is a significant advance for the field of Virtual Reality in healthcare, and for digital therapeutics broadly,"" said Senator <span class=""xn-person"">Bill Frist</span>, MD, Founding Partner, BehaVR.

<b>Understanding Virtual Reality Based Prescription Digital Therapeutics<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Prescription Digital Therapeutics (PDTs) are clinically validated software-based interventions that prevent, manage, or treat a medical disease or disorder. PDTs are approved by regulators and available by prescription for use alone or alongside other medications or medical devices. BehaVR is creating VR PDTs informed by decades of neuroscience and cognitive research, along with evidence-based protocols that are translated into the medium to treat those with anxiety and depression. The intent of these three products, in this collaboration, is that they will be classified as a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) and will fall under the FDA regulatory framework that supports innovation and commercialization of digital tools while protecting patient health.

<b>About the Collaboration between Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and BehaVR</b> <br class=""dnr"" />Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma's wholly-owned US subsidiary, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. and BehaVR, signed an initial collaboration agreement in <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2020</span> to co-develop a wellness product for those who suffer from stressful, fearful, and overwhelming feelings in a social setting. This initial collaboration was the foundation for this expanded relationship to develop and commercialize three prescription digital therapeutics for social anxiety, generalized anxiety and major depression upon achievement of regulatory approvals.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-expands-approval-of-dupixent-dupilumab-to-include-children-aged-6-to-11-years-with-moderate-to-severe-asthma-301405141.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">REGN</a>) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma.

""Despite available treatments, moderate-to-severe asthma can severely impact children's developing airways, causing sleepless nights, persistent coughing and wheezing, and potentially life-threatening exacerbations that require the use of systemic steroids that can negatively affect growth,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span>, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. ""This approval means that Dupixent, a first-of-its-kind treatment with a well-established efficacy and safety profile, can now be used by younger children with certain types of moderate-to-severe asthma in the U.S. In our pivotal trial, Dupixent helped children aged 6 to 11 years breathe better, suffer fewer asthma attacks and improve health-related quality of life. We also continue to study Dupixent in patients with other dermatologic, respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions where type 2 inflammation may play a role.""

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Approximately 75,000 children aged 6 to 11 years live with the uncontrolled moderate-to-severe form of the disease in the U.S., with many more worldwide. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators, these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. They also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks.

""This FDA approval brings new hope for children who may be suffering from life-threatening asthma attacks and poor lung function, affecting their ability to breathe, potentially into adulthood,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Naimish Patel</span>, M.D., Head of Global Development in Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""Dupixent has helped to make a difference to the lives of many patients and families across three diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation, with more than 300,000 patients treated globally. We now have the opportunity to offer a safe and effective treatment option to children as young as 6 years of age living with certain types of moderate-to-severe asthma.""

The FDA approval is based on data from a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent combined with standard-of-care asthma therapy in children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. More than 90% of children in the trial had at least one concurrent type 2 inflammatory condition.

Among patients who entered the trial with high levels of a certain type of white blood cell (eosinophils [EOS] =300 cells/µl; n=259), those who added Dupixent (100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks, based on weight) to standard-of-care experienced:
<ul>
 	<li>Substantially reduced rate of severe asthma attacks, with a 65% average reduction over one year compared to placebo (0.24 events per year for Dupixent vs. 0.67 for placebo).</li>
 	<li>Improved lung function observed as early as two weeks and sustained for up to 52 weeks, measured by percent predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> (FEV<sub>1</sub>pp).
<ul>
 	<li>At 12 weeks, patients taking Dupixent improved their lung function by 5.32 percentage points compared to placebo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Improved asthma control at 24 weeks, with 81% of patients reporting a clinically meaningful improvement based on disease symptoms and impact compared to 64% of placebo patients as measured by a =0.5 improvement on a 7-point scale.</li>
</ul>
Children with elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO =20 ppb), an airway biomarker of inflammation that plays a major role in asthma, were also evaluated. In this subgroup, children who added Dupixent to standard-of-care experienced a reduction in the rate of severe asthma attacks.

The safety results from the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma, with the addition of helminth infections which were reported in 2.2% of Dupixent patients and 0.7% of placebo patients. The overall rates of adverse events were 83% for Dupixent and 80% for placebo. The most common adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo were injection site reactions (18% Dupixent, 13% placebo), viral upper respiratory tract infections (12% Dupixent, 10% placebo) and eosinophilia (6% Dupixent, 1% placebo).

Dupixent is currently under regulatory review for children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe asthma in the European Union and other health authorities worldwide.

<b>About the LIBERTY ASTHMA VOYAGE Trial<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent combined with standard-of-care asthma therapy in 408 children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. In this trial, 86% of children had markers of type 2 inflammation underlying their asthma.

The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year, and the key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub>pp at week 12. The FEV<sub>1</sub>pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age, height, sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development. Additional secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline in responder rates as measured by a =0.5 improvement on the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) 7-Interviewer Administered.

<b>About Dupixent<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Dupixent is an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. For pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years, Dupixent dosing is based on weight (100 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks for children =15 to &lt;30 kg and 200 mg every two weeks for children =30 kg) and is supplied as a pre-filled syringe. It is also available as a pre-filled pen for adolescents (12 to 17 years) and adults at 200 mg and 300 mg doses. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age, Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home.

In the U.S., Dupixent is approved as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; in patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.

Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT <i>MyWay<sup>®</sup></i> program. For more information, please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit <a href=""http://www.dupixent.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.DUPIXENT.com</a>.

Dupixent is also approved in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> and other countries around the world for use in certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations, as well as specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world, and more than 300,000 patients have been treated globally.

Dupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary <i>VelocImmune<sup>®</sup></i> technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and CRSwNP.

<b>About Regeneron's VelocImmune Technology<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune </i>technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span> was a graduate student with his mentor <span class=""xn-person"">Frederick W. Alt</span> in 1985, they were the first to <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3330221-1&amp;h=2941549134&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2F0168952585900897&amp;a=envision"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">envision</a> making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing <i>VelocImmune</i> and related <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup></i> technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used <i>VelocImmune</i> technology to create approximately a quarter of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent, REGEN-COV<sup>®</sup> (casirivimab and imdevimab), Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab), Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), Evkeeza<sup>®</sup> (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb<sup>™ </sup>(atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn).

<b>Dupilumab Development Program<br class=""dnr"" /></b>To date, dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.

Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.

<b>U.S. Indications</b>

DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:
<ul>
 	<li>to treat people aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 years of age.</li>
 	<li>with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in people aged 6 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.</li>
 	<li>with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis under 18 years of age.</li>
</ul>
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS</b>

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced topline results from a Phase 3 randomized, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a 30-µg booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in more than 10,000 individuals 16 years of age and older. In the trial, a booster dose administered to individuals who previously received the Pfizer-BioNTech primary two-dose series restored vaccine protection against COVID-19 to the high levels achieved after the second dose, showing a relative vaccine efficacy of 95.6% when compared to those who did not receive a booster. These are the first efficacy results from any randomized, controlled COVID-19 vaccine booster trial.
<p id=""news-body-cta"">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <a class=""ext"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211021005491/en/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-extlink="""">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211021005491/en/</a></p>
“These results provide further evidence of the benefits of boosters as we aim to keep people well-protected against this disease,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “In addition to our efforts to increase global access and uptake among the unvaccinated, we believe boosters have a critical role to play in addressing the ongoing public health threat of this pandemic. We look forward to sharing these data with health authorities and working together to determine how they can be used to support the rollout of booster doses around the world.”

“These important data add to the body of evidence suggesting that a booster dose of our vaccine can help protect a broad population of people from this virus and its variants,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-Founder of BioNTech. “Based on these findings we believe that, in addition to broad global access to vaccines for everyone, booster vaccinations could play an important role in sustaining pandemic containment and a return to normalcy.”

All trial participants previously completed the primary two-dose series of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and then were randomized 1:1 to receive either a 30-µg booster dose (the same dosage strength as those in the primary series) or placebo. The median time between second dose and administration of the booster dose or placebo was approximately 11 months. Symptomatic COVID-19 occurrence was measured from at least 7 days after booster or placebo, with a median follow-up of 2.5 months. During the study period, there were 5 cases of COVID-19 in the booster group, and 109 cases in the non-boosted group. The observed relative vaccine efficacy of 95.6% (95% CI: 89.3, 98.6) reflects the reduction in disease occurrence in the boosted group versus the non-boosted group in those without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Median age of participants was 53 years, with 55.5% of participants between 16 and 55 years, and 23.3% of participants 65 years and older. Multiple subgroup analyses showed efficacy was consistent irrespective of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or comorbid conditions.

The adverse event profile was generally consistent with other clinical safety data for the vaccine, with no safety concerns identified.

Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit detailed results from the trial for peer-reviewed publication. The companies also plan to share these data with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, and other regulatory agencies around the world as soon as possible.

<b>Pfizer Disclosure Notice
</b>The information contained in this release is as of October 21, 2021. Pfizer assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or developments.

This release contains forward-looking information about Pfizer’s efforts to combat COVID-19, the collaboration between BioNTech and Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program and COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) (BNT162b2) (including potential of booster doses, qualitative assessments of available data, potential benefits, expectations for clinical trials, the anticipated timing of data readouts, regulatory submissions, regulatory approvals or authorizations and anticipated manufacturing, distribution and supply) involving substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with preclinical and clinical data (including the Phase 3 data), including the possibility of unfavorable new preclinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing preclinical, clinical or safety data; the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results, including the rate of vaccine effectiveness and safety and tolerability profile observed to date, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial and additional studies or in larger, more diverse populations following commercialization; the ability of BNT162b2 to prevent COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants; the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine will lead to new information about efficacy, safety, or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious; the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and with what modifications and interpretations; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future preclinical and clinical studies; whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for BNT162b2 in younger pediatric populations, applications for a potential booster dose and/or other biologics license and/or emergency use authorization applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for BNT162b2 or any other potential vaccines that may arise from the BNT162 program, and if obtained, whether or when such emergency use authorization or licenses will expire or terminate; whether and when any applications that may be pending or filed for BNT162b2 (including the potential submissions for younger pediatric populations, a potential booster dose or any other requested amendments to the emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations) or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine’s efficacy and, if approved, whether it will be commercially successful; decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of a vaccine, including development of products or therapies by other companies; disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners, clinical trial sites or third-party suppliers; the risk that demand for any products may be reduced or no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture a vaccine; challenges related to our vaccine’s formulation, two-dose schedule and attendant storage, distribution and administration requirements, including risks related to storage and handling after delivery by Pfizer; the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations, booster doses or new variant-specific vaccines; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or maintain access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our vaccine, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods as previously indicated; whether and when additional supply agreements will be reached; uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations; challenges related to public vaccine confidence or awareness; uncertainties regarding the impact of COVID-19 on Pfizer’s business, operations and financial results; and competitive developments.

A further description of risks and uncertainties can be found in Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and in its subsequent reports on Form 10-Q, including in the sections thereof captioned “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results”, as well as in its subsequent reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and available at <a class=""ext"" href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globenewswire.com%2FTracker%3Fdata%3DRnYjuX1qNnk63wnFRI2njqkWCUtSvj6x_99MqPLwYIXuudw4effilg2LyEquwqm-7QGJ6tM6dhKt8Yb6iY-5gw%3D%3D&amp;esheet=52513189&amp;newsitemid=20211021005491&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;index=16&amp;md5=1df2ec2bc0981c67043db5af0cd84bf8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-extlink="""">www.sec.gov</a> and <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globenewswire.com%2FTracker%3Fdata%3DRnYjuX1qNnk63wnFRI2njhMtuWVC6S5kOg8JnuFHwPyIzH1O7AiSzrr-wECJd2hrMZ7668ALHee8mVEXVNXWFA%3D%3D&amp;esheet=52513189&amp;newsitemid=20211021005491&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.pfizer.com&amp;index=17&amp;md5=ee3f347e85fc15fb8f435e4a4e5e606f"" rel=""nofollow"">www.pfizer.com</a>.

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend PREVNAR 20<sup>™</sup> (Pneumococcal 20-valent Conjugate Vaccine) for routine use to help protect adults against invasive disease and pneumonia caused by the 20 <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (pneumococcus) serotypes in the vaccine. Specifically, the ACIP voted to recommend the following:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><i>Adults 65 years of age or older who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 or PCV15). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23.</i></li>
 	<li><i>Adults aged 19 years of age or older with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors<sup>1</sup> who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 or PCV15). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23.</i></li>
</ul>
The recommendations will be forwarded to the director of the CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for review and following approval, the recommendations are published in the <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>. This will represent the first-time any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been routinely recommended for certain risk populations ages 19 to 64 years, such as people with diabetes and asthma.

“A single dose of PREVNAR 20 helps protect adults against vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease during a period where their risk is gradually increasing due to aging among other factors. Today’s vote acknowledges the important role of adult immunizations in helping protect eligible populations against certain potentially serious respiratory diseases during the current pandemic and beyond,” said Luis Jodar, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Pfizer Vaccines. “The ACIP recommendation recognizes the significance as well of helping protect more populations under age 65 with co-morbid and immunocompromising conditions who are at increased risk of disease against these 20 disease-causing serotypes.”

The seven additional serotypes in PREVNAR 20 represent 30 percent of overall of invasive pneumococcal disease burden in U.S. adults.<sup>2</sup> Pneumococcal pneumonia results in more than 180,000 adult hospital admissions and more than 150,000 adult outpatient visits in the U.S. each year.<sup>3</sup>

“The new simplified ACIP recommendation may offer the opportunity to improve immunization rates and therefore help prevent more disease,” said Nanette Cocero, Ph.D., Global President, Pfizer Vaccines. “We believe that as U.S. health care professionals start implementing this ACIP recommendation, once endorsed by the CDC Director, PREVNAR 20 recommended as a single dose has the potential to provide an important public health benefit for adults. Building on Pfizer’s more than 20-year legacy of developing and supplying pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, we remain committed to working with the healthcare and public health communities to raise awareness of the importance of adult immunization and encourage recommended individuals to get vaccinated.”

<b>About PREVNAR 20</b>

PREVNAR 20 is a next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that includes capsular polysaccharide conjugates for the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) already included in Prevnar 13<sup>®</sup> (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM<sub>197</sub> Protein]). The vaccine also contains capsular polysaccharide conjugates for seven additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F and 33F) that cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD),<sup>4,5,6,7,8</sup> and have been associated with high case-fatality rates,<sup>9,10,11,12</sup> antibiotic resistance,<sup>13,14,15</sup> and/or meningitis.<sup>16,17 </sup>PREVNAR 20 contains the broadest serotype coverage of any conjugate vaccine available; and helps protect against more strains of the bacteria that cause pneumococcal pneumonia than any conjugate vaccine available.

On June 8, 2021, Pfizer announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved PREVNAR 20 for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia in adults age 18 years or older. On February 26, 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review Pfizer’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate, as submitted for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by <i>S. pneumoniae</i> serotypes in the vaccine in adults ages 18 years and older. The formal review process by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) currently is ongoing.

<b>INDICATIONS FOR PREVNAR 20<sup>™</sup></b>

Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MIRM), a leader in rare liver disease, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved LIVMARLI™ (maralixibat) oral solution for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) one year of age and older. LIVMARLI, a minimally absorbed ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor, is the first and only FDA-approved medication in this rare liver disease which affects 2,000 to 2,500 children in the United States. LIVMARLI is now available for prescribing. In conjunction with the approval, Mirum received a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher.

“Children with Alagille syndrome suffer from cholestatic pruritus, which is serious, unremitting, and debilitating. Their sleep is disrupted, and they endure bleeding and scarring of the skin due to unrelenting scratching,” said Binita M. Kamath, MBBChir, Pediatric Hepatologist, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), Toronto, Ontario, Canada. “There have been no approved treatments to date for cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome, and many children ultimately require major surgical interventions such as liver transplantation for refractory pruritus. The approval of LIVMARLI signifies a meaningful shift in the treatment paradigm for Alagille syndrome and provides hope for the many families who have lived with persistent itch for far too long.”

ALGS is a rare genetic disorder caused by abnormalities in bile ducts that can lead to progressive liver disease. Malformed or reduced bile ducts cause cholestasis, the accumulation of bile acids in the liver, which leads to inflammation and liver injury, and prevents the liver from working properly. Cholestasis in ALGS is associated with pruritus which is among the most common indications for liver transplant in ALGS.

The approval of LIVMARLI is based on the pivotal ICONIC study as well as five years of data from supportive studies resulting in a robust body of evidence in 86 patients with ALGS. Data from ICONIC demonstrated statistically significant reductions in pruritus, one of the most common and arduous symptoms associated with the disease, which was maintained through four years.

“Today is a great day for the Alagille syndrome community with the approval of a much-needed new treatment option to address one of the most debilitating effects of this disease,” said Chris Peetz, president and chief executive officer of Mirum. “We are grateful to the patients, families, and healthcare professionals who advanced the research and participated in the LIVMARLI clinical studies. Today is also a landmark day for Mirum as we take steps forward in developing potentially life-changing medicines for rare liver disease.”

“We have had the pleasure of being part of and closely following the clinical progress of LIVMARLI in many ways. Since the first study’s initiation more than a decade ago, we have dreamed of today, seeing LIVMARLI receive FDA approval, marking an incredibly meaningful milestone for the ALGS community,” said Roberta Smith, president, Alagille Syndrome Alliance and an ALGS mom. “Until now, patients have had limited-to-no treatment options to address the severe and unrelenting itch that significantly impacts both patients and their families. Additionally, because pruritus associated with ALGS greatly impacts caregivers, having a strong support program like Mirum Access Plus to reduce the strain on families is so important. The ALGS community has been waiting for a long time for a treatment and we’re so pleased that LIVMARLI is now available in the United States.”

<b>Mirum Access Plus (MAP)</b>

LIVMARLI will be accessible to patients with a prescription through Mirum Access Plus (MAP), the company’s patient support services program and single-source specialty pharmacy. The MAP program has fully dedicated and experienced coordinators who will work with healthcare providers and families to provide insurance coverage and access support, as well as help with financial support options for LIVMARLI. A dedicated Navigator team will also provide health education and will connect families to resources and tools to support their disease. MAP staff are available Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET by calling 855-MRM-4YOU (1-855-676-4968) or more information, visit <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.livmarli.com.&amp;esheet=52500707&amp;newsitemid=20210929005810&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.livmarli.com.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=2a93e0d75ed6aa4b109d628442ca2ba0"" rel=""nofollow"">www.livmarli.com.</a>

<b>About Alagille syndrome</b>

Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is a rare genetic disorder in which bile ducts are abnormally narrow, malformed and reduced in number, which leads to bile accumulation in the liver and ultimately progressive liver disease. The estimated incidence of ALGS is one in every 30,000 people.<sup>1</sup> In patients with ALGS, multiple organ systems may be affected by the mutation, including the liver, heart, kidneys and central nervous system.<sup>2</sup> The accumulation of bile acids prevents the liver from working properly to eliminate waste from the bloodstream and, according to recent reports, 60% to 75% of patients with ALGS have a liver transplant before reaching adulthood.<sup>3</sup> Signs and symptoms arising from liver damage in ALGS may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin), xanthomas (disfiguring cholesterol deposits under the skin), and pruritus (itch)<sup>2</sup>. The pruritus experienced by patients with ALGS is among the most severe in any chronic liver disease and is present in most affected children by the third year of life.<sup>4</sup>

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>LIVMARLI can cause serious side effects, including:</b>

<b>Changes in liver tests</b>. Changes in certain liver tests are common in patients with Alagille syndrome and can worsen during treatment with LIVMARLI. These changes may be a sign of liver injury and can be serious. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before starting and during treatment to check your liver function. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any signs or symptoms of liver problems, including nausea or vomiting, skin or the white part of the eye turns yellow, dark or brown urine, pain on the right side of the stomach (abdomen) or loss of appetite.

<b>Stomach and intestinal (gastrointestinal) problems</b>. LIVMARLI can cause stomach and intestinal problems, including diarrhea, stomach pain, and vomiting during treatment. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms more often or more severely than normal for you.

A condition called <b>Fat Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency</b> caused by low levels of certain vitamins (vitamin A, D, E, and K) stored in body fat. FSV deficiency is common in patients with Alagille syndrome but may worsen during treatment. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before starting and during treatment.

Other common side effects reported during treatment were bone fractures and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Selecta Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: SELB), a biotechnology company leveraging its clinically validated ImmTOR™ platform to develop tolerogenic therapies that selectively mitigate unwanted immune responses, and Genovis (GENO), an enzyme technology company, today announced a strategic licensing agreement to advance a next-generation IgG protease. This partnership leverages Genovis’ proprietary immunoglobulin G (IgG) protease, IdeXork (Xork), and Selecta’s ImmTOR platform to enable the dosing of transformative gene therapies in patients with pre-existing adeno-associated virus (AAV) immunity and treat certain IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases.

Most IgG proteases are derived from human pathogens and have a high prevalence of pre-existing antibodies. Xork is derived from a Streptococcal bacterial strain that does not infect humans. The pre-clinical data generated to date highlights Xork’s differentiated profile - demonstrating very low cross-reactivity with naturally occurring antibodies in human sera while retaining efficient and specific cleavage of human IgG antibodies.

Currently, pre-existing IgG antibodies against AAV gene therapy vectors are a major exclusion criterion for AAV gene therapy eligibility, affecting upwards of 40% of the population. Additionally, de novo immunogenicity that follows treatment by AAV gene therapy results in the formation of high titers of neutralizing antibodies. These neutralizing antibodies preclude re-treatment of those patients who may need additional dosing to maintain therapeutic benefit. The combination of Xork and ImmTOR has the potential to both mitigate pre-existing antibodies to AAV, expanding access to gene therapy to a wider range of patients, and prevent de novo immunogenicity, keeping patients eligible for re-treatment.

Additionally, bacterial-derived IgG proteases are themselves immunogenic. Currently, IgG proteases can only be administered once due to the formation of high titer antibodies against the protease itself. The combination of Xork and ImmTOR is further differentiated by the potential of ImmTOR to mitigate the immunogenicity of Xork and enable re-dosing of Xork, an important benefit for the application of IgG proteases in autoimmune diseases mediated by pathogenic autoantibodies.

Fredrik Olsson, chief executive officer of Genovis, commented, “We are excited to partner with Selecta as we look to expand into the gene therapy field and address the challenge of pre-existing immunity to AAV vectors. While IgG proteases have shown promise, overcoming the immunogenicity of the enzyme remains a significant hurdle. We believe Selecta’s ImmTOR platform, which is designed to mitigate unwanted immune responses, in combination with Xork has the potential to be transformational in both gene therapies and autoimmune diseases.”

“We see this strategic collaboration with Genovis as an important step in expanding our pipeline of novel therapeutics in combination with our ImmTOR platform,” said Carsten Brunn, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Selecta. “Our preclinical findings in gene therapy indicate that ImmTOR has the potential to increase transgene expression and durability, enable re-dosing by inhibiting the formation of neutralizing antibodies and potentially lead to safer, more efficacious gene therapy treatment regimens. The partnership between Selecta and Genovis focuses on those patients who would otherwise be unable to be treated due to pre-existing immunity to AAV. The combination of ImmTOR with Xork has the potential to significantly expand access to life changing gene therapies for those patients in need.”

<strong>Terms of agreement</strong>
Under the terms of the agreement, Selecta has provided Genovis with an upfront payment for an exclusive license to Xork for all therapeutic uses in humans while Genovis retains rights to research, preclinical, diagnostic, and other potential non-therapeutic applications of Xork. Additionally, Genovis is eligible to earn development and sales-based milestones, as well as tiered royalties on worldwide sales in the low double digits.

<p align=""justify"">Findings from the pivotal Phase 3 VANISH-303 clinical trial led to the June approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of BREXAFEMME<sup>®</sup> (ibrexafungerp tablets) for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), the first new antifungal class of therapy in more than 20 years.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We hope the publication of these important findings from the groundbreaking research of our VANISH-303 study will provide clinicians valuable insight regarding the efficacy and safety of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections,” said David Angulo, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of SCYNEXIS. “With a distinct mechanism of action that effectively kills the fungi responsible for the infection, this treatment is an additional option for women across the country.”</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: a Phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH-303)</strong> – The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC, also known as vaginal yeast infection.
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li>The study found that oral ibrexafungerp was statistically superior versus placebo in completely resolving signs and symptoms of VVC at Day 10 (50.5% [95/188] vs 28.6% [28/98], respectively; P=0.001) without the need for additional antifungal treatments, including topicals.</li>
 	<li>Results also showed superior mycological eradication (49.5% [93/188] vs 19.4% [19/98]; P&lt;0.001), when compared with placebo.</li>
 	<li>Symptom resolution was sustained and further increased with ibrexafungerp compared with placebo (59.6% [112/188] vs 44.9% [44/98]; P=0.009) at follow-up.</li>
 	<li><em>Post hoc</em> analysis showed similar rates of clinical cure and clinical improvement at test-of-cure for African American patients (54.8% [40/73] and 63.4% [47/73], respectively) and patients with a body mass index &gt;35 (54.5% [24/44] and 68.2% [30/44], respectively) compared with overall rates.</li>
 	<li>Ibrexafungerp was well-tolerated. Adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal in nature and mild in severity.</li>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp vs. fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis</strong> – The results of the double-blind, randomized, dose-finding DOVE study, evaluated different regimens of ibrexafungerp and included fluconazole as comparator, the standard of care for the treatment of moderate to severe VVC. The study was designed to guide dose selection for the Phase 3 program and was not powered to demonstrate statistical differences among the groups. Patients with composite vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (VSS) scores greater than or equal to seven (=7) were randomized equally to six treatments groups: five different dose regimens of oral ibrexafungerp or oral fluconazole 150 mg. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure, defined as complete resolution of VVC signs and symptoms at the test-of-cure visit on Day 10. Symptom resolution was also evaluated at Day 25.
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li>The study identified the ibrexafungerp oral dose regimen of 300mg BID for one day as optimal for the Phase 3 program. The Day 10 clinical cure rate reported for this regimen was 51.9%, and 70.4% of patients reported no symptoms at Day 25. The active comparator (fluconazole) resulted in a Day 10 cure rate of 58.3% and 50.0% of patients with no symptoms at Day 25.*</li>
 	<li>The use of rescue antifungal medication during the study was reported in 3.7% of patients receiving the selected dose regimen of ibrexafungerp. For the same analysis, 29.2% of patients receiving fluconazole received rescue antifungal medications.*</li>
 	<li>Ibrexafungerp was well-tolerated, with the most common treatment-related adverse events being mild gastrointestinal events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">*It should not be inferred from these results that a claim of superiority of ibrexafungerp over fluconazole for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis is being made.</p>

<strong>About Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC)</strong>
<p align=""justify"">Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC), commonly known as a vaginal yeast infection due to <em>Candida</em>, is the second most common cause of vaginitis. Although frequently caused by <em>Candida albicans</em>, infections caused by fluconazole-resistant and non-<em>albicans</em> <em>Candida</em> strains, such as <em>Candida glabrata</em>, have been reported to be on the rise.<sup>1</sup> VVC can be associated with significant discomfort (pain, itching, burning), reduced sexual pleasure and activity, psychological distress (stress, depression, anxiety), embarrassment, reduced physical activity, and loss of productivity. An estimated 70-75% of women worldwide will have at least one episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 40-50% of those will experience multiple episodes.<sup>2</sup></p>
<strong>About BREXAFEMME</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (ibrexafungerp tablets)</strong>
<p align=""justify"">BREXAFEMME is a novel oral antifungal approved for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), also known as vaginal yeast infection. Its mechanism of action, glucan synthase inhibition, is fungicidal against <em>Candida </em>species, meaning it kills fungal cells.<sup>3</sup> The New Drug Application (NDA) for BREXAFEMME was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 1, 2021. The NDA was supported by positive results from two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies (VANISH-303 and VANISH-306), in which oral ibrexafungerp demonstrated efficacy and a favorable tolerability profile in women with VVC. BREXAFEMME represents the first approved drug in a new antifungal class in over 20 years and is the first and only treatment for vaginal yeast infections which is both oral and non-azole.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>INDICATION</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">BREXAFEMME is a triterpenoid antifungal indicated for the treatment of adult and postmenarchal pediatric females with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).</p>
<strong>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</strong>

The recommended dosage of BREXAFEMME is 300 mg (two tablets of 150 mg) twice a day for one day, for a total treatment dosage of 600 mg. BREXAFEMME may be taken with or without food.

<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>BREXAFEMME is contraindicated during pregnancy and in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to ibrexafungerp</li>
 	<li>BREXAFEMME administration during pregnancy may cause fetal harm based on animal studies. Prior to initiating treatment, verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment</li>
 	<li>When administering BREXAFEMME with strong CYP3A inhibitors, the dose of BREXAFEMME should be reduced to 150 mg twice a day for one day. Administration of BREXAFEMME with strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided</li>
 	<li>Most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials (incidence =2%) were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, and vomiting</li>

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dupixent-dupilumab-is-the-first-biologic-to-significantly-reduce-itch-and-skin-lesions-in-phase-3-trial-for-prurigo-nodularis-demonstrating-the-role-of-type-2-inflammation-in-this-disease-301406425.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">REGN</a>) and Sanofi today announced positive pivotal Phase 3 results from a trial evaluating Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis, a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease that causes extreme itch and skin lesions. The trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints, showing that Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo in this investigational setting. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases with intense, chronic itch.

""Prurigo nodularis is an underdiagnosed disease with immense physical and emotional burden for the 74,000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with topical steroids and otherwise do not have an approved treatment option,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span>, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. ""These patients are left to cope with severe itching and painful nodules that, in turn, significantly impair one's quality of life with many resorting to immunosuppressants and some to antidepressants. These results show – for the first time in a Phase 3 prurigo nodularis trial – that a systemic medicine was able to address the most debilitating symptoms such as itch without broadly suppressing the immune system, building on the promise of Dupixent in a broad range of serious dermatologic, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases.""

People with prurigo nodularis experience intense, persistent itch, with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. It is often described as painful with burning, stinging and tingling of the skin. The debilitating signs and symptoms of prurigo nodularis can negatively impact health-related quality of life, including mental health, activities of daily living and social interactions. There are no approved systemic treatments for prurigo nodularis. High-potency topical steroids are commonly used, which are associated with safety risks if used long-term.

""We are encouraged that patients in this trial experienced a significant reduction in itch and skin lesions, especially given that prior to enrollment nearly all patients had severe itch and nearly 40% had 100 or more nodules covering their body,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">John Reed</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. ""These data are an important step forward in furthering our knowledge of the role that targeting IL-4 and IL-13 can play in the treatment of skin diseases that cause extreme itch. We are committed to continuing to leverage the robust Dupixent clinical program to transform the understanding of the science behind a number of type 2 inflammatory diseases and look forward to presenting the full results at a future medical congress.""

In the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial, topline results comparing Dupixent (n=78) to placebo (n=82) showed:
<ul>
 	<li>37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline compared to 22% of placebo patients (p=0.0216) at week 12, the primary endpoint.</li>
 	<li>At week 24, nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline: 58% of Dupixent patients compared to 20% of placebo patients (p&lt;0.0001).</li>
 	<li>At week 24, nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin: 45% of Dupixent patients compared to 16% of placebo patients (p&lt;0.0001).</li>
 	<li>Dupixent patients experienced significantly greater improvements in measures of health-related quality of life, skin pain and symptoms of anxiety and depression.</li>
</ul>
The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The occurrences of treatment-emergent adverse events were generally similar between Dupixent and placebo groups (57% [44/77] Dupixent, 51% [42/82] placebo). Rates of conjunctivitis (6% [5/77] Dupixent, 0% [0/82] placebo) and herpes viral infections (6% [5/77] Dupixent, 0% [0/82] placebo) were similar to what was previously observed in atopic dermatitis trials, and there was a numerically lower rate of skin infections observed with Dupixent (5% [4/77] Dupixent, 9% [7/82] placebo). Additionally, 3% (2/77) of Dupixent patients and 30% (25/82) of placebo patients discontinued prior to week 24.

An additional trial in the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program, PRIME, is fully enrolled. PRIME has a similar trial design and is expected to read out in in the first half of 2022. Regeneron and Sanofi plan to begin regulatory submissions in 2022.

The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

<b>About the Trial</b>

PRIME2, part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program, is a randomized, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 160 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period, patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).

The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 12 (measured by a =4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 24 and the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at week 24 (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale). Additional secondary endpoints included health-related quality of life (measured by change in baseline according to the 0-30 point Dermatology Life Quality Index), skin pain (measured by change in baseline on a 0-10 scale), and symptoms of anxiety and depression (measured by change in baseline according to a 0-42 Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale).

The average age in the trial was 49 years and 64% were female. Approximately 33% of patients were Asian, 13% were Latino/Hispanic and 5% were Black/African American. In the trial, 46% of patients had at least one coexisting type 2 inflammatory disease. About 24% of patients enrolled had prior history with systemic (non-steroidal) immunosuppressants and 11% had been treated with antidepressants.

<b>About Dupixent</b>

Dupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary <i>VelocImmune<sup>®</sup></i> technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).

Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S., <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 300,000 patients have been treated globally.

<b>About Regeneron's VelocImmune Technology</b>

Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune </i>technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span> was a graduate student with his mentor <span class=""xn-person"">Frederick W. Alt</span> in 1985, they were the first to <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3332239-1&amp;h=1868305353&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2F0168952585900897&amp;a=envision"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">envision</a> making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing <i>VelocImmune</i> and related <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup></i> technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used <i>VelocImmune</i> technology to create approximately a quarter of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent, REGEN-COV<sup>®</sup> (casirivimab and imdevimab), Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab), Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), Evkeeza<sup>®</sup> (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb<sup>™ </sup>(atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn).

<b>Dupilumab Development Program</b>

To date, dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.

Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.

<b>U.S. Indications</b>

DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:
<ul>
 	<li>to treat people aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 years of age.</li>
 	<li>with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in people aged 6 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.</li>
 	<li>with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis under 18 years of age.</li>
</ul>

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

-LEO Pharma A/S, a global leader in medical dermatology, today announced 16-week results of a 52-week monotherapy trial showing tralokinumab significantly improved primary and secondary measurements of efficacy among adolescents (aged 12 to 17) with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.<sup>1</sup> The week 16 results from the Phase 3 ECZTRA 6<b> </b>trial were shared during the 2021 Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference held virtually and with a hybrid option in Las Vegas.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“These findings are encouraging, as moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis can have major physical and psychosocial impacts on adolescents who have limited options for long-term treatment.”</p>

<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211022005060/en/Tralokinumab-Achieves-Primary-and-Secondary-Endpoints-in-Phase-3-Trial-of-Adolescents-With-Moderate-to-Severe-Atopic-Dermatitis#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
Tralokinumab is a high-affinity, human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits IL-13, a key driver of atopic dermatitis signs and symptoms.<sup>2,3 </sup>It is an investigational therapy in clinical development in the United States and has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It has been approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis by the European Commission and the MHRA in June 2021 and by Health Canada in October 2021.

“After 16 weeks, adolescents who received either dose of tralokinumab, without rescue therapy, showed significantly greater improvement in atopic dermatitis signs and symptoms and quality of life compared to those receiving placebo,” said Amy Paller, M.D., Chair, Department of Dermatology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, and the international coordinating investigator for ECZTRA 6. “These findings are encouraging, as moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis can have major physical and psychosocial impacts on adolescents who have limited options for long-term treatment.”

The 16-week initial treatment period of the ECZTRA 6 trial (NCT03526861) assessed the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab 150 mg (n=98) or 300 mg (n=97) every two weeks (Q2W) compared to placebo (n=94) in adolescents.<sup>1</sup> At week 16, tralokinumab met its primary and secondary endpoints, showing significantly more patients treated with tralokinumab achieved a clinical response, compared to placebo, defined as achieving an IGA 0/1 and/or an EASI-75<sup>1</sup>:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>21.4% (p&lt;0.001) of the tralokinumab 150 mg group and 17.5% (p=0.002) of the tralokinumab 300 mg group achieved clear or almost-clear skin compared to 4.3% with placebo as measured by IGA.<sup>1</sup></li>
 	<li>28.6% (p&lt;0.001) of the tralokinumab 150 mg group and 27.8% (p=0.001) of the tralokinumab 300 mg group achieved 75% or greater disease improvement from baseline compared to 6.4% with placebo as measured by EASI.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
Secondary endpoints were all met, addressing extent and severity of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD), achieving at least a 4-point improvement in adolescent weekly average worst daily pruritus NRS score and health-related quality of life related to dermatological conditions (CDLQI).<sup>1</sup>

The safety and tolerability of tralokinumab compared with placebo, when used to treat adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, was also investigated. The overall frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) in the trial were comparable across the treatment groups over 16 weeks (67% for tralokinumab 150 mg, 65% for tralokinumab 300 mg, and 62% for placebo).<sup>1</sup>

The percentage of AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation and conjunctivitis events were similar between both doses of tralokinumab (150 mg and 300 mg) and placebo treatment groups in the initial treatment period of 16 weeks. Most AEs in the three treatment groups were mild or moderate in severity and subjects recovered from most. The safety results were consistent with the Phase 3 adult tralokinumab trials.<sup>1</sup>

“We are encouraged by these results that advance our understanding of tralokinumab in adolescents, many of whom often struggle with the negative emotional and physical impacts of atopic dermatitis,” said Jörg Möller, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Research and Development, LEO Pharma. “This is an important milestone for the overall ECZTRA clinical trial program as we expand studies to include younger patients.”

<b>About the ECZTRA 6 Trial</b>

<b>ECZTRA 6</b> (ECZema TRAlokinumab trial No. 6, NCT03526861) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational 52-week trial, including a total of 301 patients (aged 12 to 17), with 289 (195 tralokinumab patients and 94 placebo patients) in the full analysis set, evaluating the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab (150 mg or 300 mg) as a monotherapy compared to placebo in adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who were candidates for systemic therapy.<sup>1,4</sup>

Following a washout period, patients were randomized to subcutaneous tralokinumab 150 mg or 300 mg Q2W or placebo for an initial 16 weeks. Tralokinumab dosing started with a 300 mg or 600 mg loading dose on day 0 for those receiving tralokinumab 150 mg or 300 mg Q2W, respectively.<sup>1</sup>

At week 16, patients who responded to tralokinumab with an IGA score of 0/1 and/or EASI change of at least 75% from baseline, without use of rescue treatment, were re-randomized to tralokinumab Q2W or Q4W for an additional 36 weeks. Patients not achieving primary endpoints at week 16, those receiving rescue treatment from week 2 to week 16, and those meeting other specific criteria were transferred to open-label treatment of tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W plus optional mild-to-moderate strength topical corticosteroids.<sup>1</sup>

<b>About atopic dermatitis</b>

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory, skin disease characterized by intense itch and eczematous lesions.<sup>5</sup> Atopic dermatitis is the result of skin barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation, leading to chronic inflammation.<sup>6</sup> Type 2 cytokines, including IL-13, play a central role in the key aspects of atopic dermatitis pathophysiology.<sup>2</sup>

Marinomed Biotech AG (VSE:MARI), a globally operating biopharmaceutical company, announced today a new collaboration and licensing agreement with Luoxin Pharmaceutical Group Stock Co., Ltd. (Stock Code: 002793.SZ, hereinafter referred to as “Luoxin Pharmaceutical”), one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in China. Luoxin Pharmaceutical will further develop and commercialize Budesolv for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Budesolv, a new formulation of the glucocorticoid budesonide, is the first medication originating from Marinomed’s proprietary Marinosolv platform. Budesolv has successfully completed a pivotal Phase III clinical study, necessary for marketing authorization in Europe. The agreement to commercialize Budesolv in Greater China, is Marinomed’s important next milestone on the communicated development path of the Marinosolv technology platform.

Luoxin Pharmaceutical will co-develop Budesolv for the Chinese markets and will be responsible for clinical development and obtaining the Chinese marketing authorization. This comprises building production capacities, holding the exclusive distribution rights, as well as ultimately being responsible for manufacturing and marketing Budesolv. Under the terms of the agreement, Marinomed will receive an upfront payment of USD 2 million, however, due to legal and corporate finance advisory fees with limited impact on current year’s profit and loss statement. Depending on the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones, Marinomed is eligible to receive double-digit million US-Dollar milestone payments as well as royalties on Budesolv sales in Greater China.

The decision to withdraw the BLA does not change the development plans for balstilimab combinations.

Following the full approval of pembrolizumab, announced four months earlier than the FDA goal date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) no longer considered it appropriate to review the BLA for accelerated approval and recommended Agenus withdraw. The BLA submission for balstilimab received Fast Track and Priority Review designation from the FDA, with a target action date of December 16, 2021. As part of the BLA review process, Agenus successfully completed 3 FDA inspections with no cited issues, concerns, or Form-483s.

As previously reported, in the largest single-arm trial to date in this population (140 evaluable patients), balstilimab demonstrated objective responses in both PD-L1 positive and negative patients, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 20% and 8% respectively<sup>1</sup>. Pembrolizumab has demonstrated an ORR of 14% and 0% in PD-L1 positive and negative patients respectively, which led to its accelerated approval in 2018. Balstilimab has shown superior killing of PD-L1 negative tumors compared to other anti PD-1 therapies, including pembrolizumab, suggesting a broader mechanism consistent with balstilimab’s clinical activity in both PD-L1 positive and negative cervical cancer<sup>2</sup>.

Concurrent with the withdrawal, Agenus will discontinue its ongoing confirmatory trial (BRAVA) in this population, which is expected to reduce R&amp;D expenses by over $100M. However, given the clinical benefit demonstrated by balstilimab, Agenus plans to launch expanded access programs to give patients and doctors access to balstilimab in several countries, including the US, pending regulatory processes.

“While the commercial market for balstilimab monotherapy in second line cervical cancer was always anticipated to be small, Agenus’ priority remains developing balstilimab as a necessary component of highly effective and affordable combination therapies, both with its own portfolio and with partners, including in combination with Agenus’ next-generation CTLA-4, AGEN1181,” said Garo Armen, CEO and Chairman of Agenus.

“Balstilimab has demonstrated meaningful clinical activity and an excellent safety profile in second-line cervical cancer, including in PD-L1 negative patients, who are ineligible to receive standard of care anti-PD-1 therapy, which makes the decision to withdraw so difficult for us,” said Steven O’Day, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Agenus. “Balstilimab remains a critical component of our combination regimens, including with our next-generation CTLA-4 agent, AGEN1181. Concomitant with presentation of new data at SITC next month, we continue to accelerate development of AGEN1181 in combination with balstilimab in trials designed to rapidly support full or accelerated approval in multiple tumor types.”

Agenus executives will host a conference call to discuss this update at 8:30AM ET today.

Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Susvimo <sup>TM</sup> (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL for intravitreal use via ocular implant for the treatment of people with wet, or neovascular, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who have previously responded to at least two anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. Wet AMD is a potentially blinding condition that requires treatment with eye injections as often as once a month. Susvimo, previously called Port Delivery System with ranibizumab, is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for wet AMD that offers as few as two treatments per year.

“Susvimo represents a major advancement in the treatment of retinal disease, and is an important new option for patients with wet AMD,” said Carl Regillo, M.D., Chief of Retina Service at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia and an Archway study investigator. “With Susvimo, my patients now have an option that can help them maintain their vision as well as anti-VEGF injections, but on a more manageable twice-yearly treatment schedule.”

<a name=""_1fob9te""></a>Susvimo delivers ranibizumab continuously, offering people living with wet AMD an alternative to anti-VEGF eye injections needed as often as once a month. The implant is surgically inserted into the eye during a one-time, outpatient procedure and refilled every six months. If necessary, supplemental ranibizumab treatment can be given to the affected eye while the Susvimo implant is in place.

“We believe that Susvimo can help people with wet AMD preserve their vision while potentially alleviating the treatment burden associated with current standards of care,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “Susvimo’s approval builds on Genentech's long-standing commitment to people living with vision-threatening conditions.”

<a name=""_3znysh7""></a>

<a name=""_2et92p0""></a>The approval is based on positive results from the Phase III Archway study primary analysis, which showed wet AMD patients treated with Susvimo achieved and maintained vision gains equivalent to monthly ranibizumab injections – +0.2 and +0.5 eye chart letters from baseline, respectively – at weeks 36 and 40 of treatment. In addition, only 1.6% of Susvimo patients received supplemental ranibizumab treatment before their first refill, and more than 98% could go six months before their first refill.

In the Archway study, Susvimo was generally well-tolerated, with a favorable benefit-risk profile. However, the Susvimo implant has been associated with a three-fold higher rate of endophthalmitis than monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Many of these events were associated with conjunctival retractions or erosions. Appropriate conjunctiva management and early detection with surgical repair of conjunctival retractions or erosions may reduce the risk of endophthalmitis. In clinical trials, 2.0% of patients receiving a ranibizumab implant experienced at least one episode of endophthalmitis. The most common adverse events (AEs) were conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctival hyperemia, iritis and eye pain. The safety profile of Susvimo in the clinical trial setting is well understood and will continue to be monitored closely.

<a name=""_tyjcwt""></a>

Genentech has a robust Phase III clinical development program for Susvimo, including the Portal, Pagoda, Pavilion and Velodrome studies. Portal is an extension study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of Susvimo in wet AMD. Pagoda is evaluating Susvimo for the treatment of people with diabetic macular edema (DME), while Pavilion is a study of Susvimo in diabetic retinopathy without DME. Velodrome is evaluating Susvimo refilled every nine months in wet AMD. Susvimo is also currently under review for the treatment of wet AMD by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Susvimo will be available in the United States in the coming months. Genentech is committed to helping people access the medicines they are prescribed and will be offering comprehensive services for people prescribed Susvimo to help minimize barriers to access and reimbursement. Patients can call 833-EYE-GENE for more information. For people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions. More information is also available at (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or <a href=""http://www.genentech-access.com/"">http://www.Genentech-Access.com</a>.

Genentech’s late-stage ophthalmology portfolio also includes faricimab, a bispecific antibody under FDA and EMA review for the treatment of wet AMD and DME. The FDA is additionally reviewing faricimab for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

<a name=""_1t3h5sf""></a>Genentech developed the first anti-VEGF medicine that not only slowed the progression of wet AMD, but restored vision for many patients. Lucentis <sup>®</sup> (ranibizumab injection) was first approved for wet AMD by the FDA in 2006.

<strong>About the Archway Study</strong>
Archway (<a href=""https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03677934%3Fterm%3Darchway%26rank%3D1&amp;data=02%7C01%7Csdaily%40bmctoday.com%7C51c8ee9a3f9e44cfec2308d70a1fe7aa%7C253279f1cd5f47688ebb08d87e3abee7%7C1%7C0%7C636989004455122604&amp;sdata=FEziYwrJ4D0yxR0is6ef9lxFT0Xs7I22Su6EK7podac%3D&amp;reserved=0"">NCT03677934</a>) was a randomized, multicenter, open-label Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL for intravitreal use via ocular implant administered via the Susvimo eye implant, refilled every six months at fixed intervals, compared to monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.5 mg in 415 people living with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Patients enrolled in Archway were responders to prior treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. In both study arms, patients were treated with at least three anti-VEGF injections within the six months prior to their Archway screening visit. The primary endpoint of the study was the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score (the best distance vision a person can achieve – including with correction such as glasses – when reading letters on an eye chart) from baseline at the average of Week 36 and Week 40. Secondary endpoints include safety, overall change in BCVA from baseline and change from baseline in center point thickness over time.

According to pre-specified study criteria, Susvimo was shown to be non-inferior and equivalent to monthly ranibizumab injections. On average, patients had received five prior ranibizumab injections before their first study treatment visit. In the Susvimo arm of the study, patients gained an average of 0.2 eye chart letters in visual acuity from baseline compared with 0.5 eye chart letters for the monthly ranibizumab arm. During the first treatment interval, before the first scheduled refill, 1.6% of Susvimo patients assessed (n=4/246) received supplemental ranibizumab treatment, and 98.4% of patients (n=242/246) did not receive supplemental treatment.

In the Archway study, Susvimo was generally well-tolerated, with a favorable benefit-risk profile. However, the Susvimo implant has been associated with a three-fold higher rate of endophthalmitis than monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Many of these events were associated with conjunctival retractions or erosions. Appropriate conjunctiva management and early detection with surgical repair of conjunctival retractions or erosions may reduce the risk of endophthalmitis. In clinical trials, 2.0% of patients receiving a ranibizumab implant experienced at least one episode of endophthalmitis.

The safety profile of Susvimo in the clinical trial setting is well understood and will continue to be monitored closely.

<strong>About </strong><strong>Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration</strong>
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the macula, the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for activities like reading, and is a leading cause of blindness for people aged 60 and over in the United States. Wet, or neovascular, AMD is an advanced form of the disease that can cause rapid and severe vision loss. Approximately 11 million people in the United States have some form of AMD, and of those, about 1.1 million have wet AMD.

Wet AMD is caused by growth of abnormal blood vessels, also referred to as choroidal neovascularization (CNV), into the macula. These vessels leak fluid and blood and cause scar tissue that destroys the central retina. This process results in a deterioration of sight over a period of months to years.

<strong>About Susvimo™ (ranibizumab injection) </strong><strong>100 mg/mL for intravitreal use via ocular implant</strong>
Susvimo™ (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL for intravitreal use via ocular implant is a refillable implant surgically inserted into the eye during a one-time, outpatient procedure. Susvimo continuously delivers a customized formulation of ranibizumab over time. Susvimo is indicated for intravitreal use via the Susvimo eye implant only. Ranibizumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to bind to and inhibit VEGF-A, a protein that has been shown to play a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels and the leakiness of the vessels.

Susvimo is different from the ranibizumab intravitreal injection, a medicine marketed as Lucentis<sup>®</sup> (ranibizumab injection), which is FDA-approved to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other retinal diseases.

<strong>Susvimo Indication</strong>
Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL for intravitreal use via ocular implant is indicated for the treatment of patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who have previously responded to at least two intravitreal injections of a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor medication.

<strong>Susvimo Important Safety Information</strong>
<strong>WARNING: ENDOPHTHALMITIS</strong>
<strong>The Susvimo implant has been associated with a three-fold higher rate of endophthalmitis than monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. In clinical trials, 2.0% of patients receiving an implant experienced at least one episode of endophthalmitis.</strong>

<strong>Warnings and Precautions:</strong>
<strong>The Susvimo implant and the procedures associated with inserting, filling, refilling, and (if medically necessary) removing the implant can cause other serious side effects, including:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>An eye infection (endophthalmitis). </strong>Endophthalmitis is an infection of the eyeball that can cause permanent damage to your eye, including blindness. Endophthalmitis requires urgent (same-day) medical or surgical treatment.</li>
 	<li><strong>A missing layer on top of the white part of the eye (conjunctival erosion). </strong>Conjunctival erosion is an area that becomes missing (defect) in the layer (conjunctiva) that covers the white part of the eye, which may result in exposure of the implant. Conjunctival erosion may require surgical treatment.</li>
 	<li><strong>An opening of the layer that covers the white part of the eye (conjunctival retraction). </strong>Conjunctival retraction is an opening or gaping in the layer (conjunctiva) that covers the white part of the eye, which may cause the implant to be exposed. Conjunctival retraction may require surgical treatment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tear and separation of layers of the retina (rhegmatogenous retinal detachment). </strong>Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment<strong> </strong>is a tear and separation of one of the layers of the retina in the back of the eye that senses light. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment requires surgical treatment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Implant movement (implant dislocation): </strong>This movement may require surgical treatment to correct.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bleeding (vitreous hemorrhage): </strong>Vitreous hemorrhage is bleeding within the gel-like substance (vitreous) inside of your eye. This may require an additional eye surgery.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bump on top of the white layer of the eye (conjunctival bleb): </strong>Conjunctival bleb is a small bulge in the layer (conjunctiva) that covers the white part of the eye where the implant is inserted. This may be due to leakage of fluid from the inside of the eye. This may require medical or surgical treatment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Temporary decrease in vision after the Susvimo procedure.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Who should not receive Susvimo?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Patients who have an infection in or around their eye, have active inflammation in their eye, or have had an allergic reaction to ranibizumab or any of its ingredients in Susvimo in the past.</li>
 	<li><strong>Information for patients who are of childbearing potential</strong></li>
 	<li>If patients are pregnant, think that they might be pregnant, or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Susvimo will harm an unborn baby. Patients should use birth control (contraception) during treatment with Susvimo and for 12 months after the last refill of Susvimo.</li>
 	<li>If patients are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Susvimo is not recommended during breastfeeding. It is not known if Susvimo passes into breast milk.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Adverse Reactions</strong>
The most common adverse reactions were blood on the white of the eye (72%), redness in the white of the eye (26%), sensitivity to light (23%), and eye pain (10%). These are not all the possible side effects of Susvimo.

You may report side effects to the FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/medwatch""><strong>http://www.fda.gov/medwatch</strong></a>. You may also report side effects to Genentech at (888) 835-2555.

<strong>About Lucentis<sup>®</sup> (ranibizumab injection)</strong>
Lucentis is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to bind to and inhibit VEGF-A, a protein that is believed to play a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and the hyperpermeability (leakiness) of the vessels.

Lucentis is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV).

Lucentis was developed by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. The company retains commercial rights in the United States and Novartis has exclusive commercial rights for the rest of the world.

Outside the United States, Lucentis is approved in more than 120 countries to treat adult patients with wet AMD, and for the treatment of visual impairment due to DME, due to macular edema secondary to both branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), and due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV).

<strong>Lucentis Important Safety Information</strong>
Patients should not use Lucentis if they have an infection in or around the eye or are allergic to Lucentis or any of its ingredients.

Lucentis is a prescription medication given by injection into the eye, and it has side effects. Some Lucentis patients have had detached retinas and serious infections inside the eye. If your eye becomes red, sensitive to light, or painful, or if there is a change in vision, call or visit your eye doctor right away.

Some patients have had increased eye pressure before and within 1 hour of an injection.

Uncommonly, Lucentis patients have had serious, sometimes fatal, problems related to blood clots, such as heart attacks or strokes.

Fatal events were seen more often in patients with DME and DR with Lucentis compared with patients who did not receive Lucentis. Although there were only few fatal events which included causes of death typical of patients with advanced diabetic complications, these events may be caused by Lucentis.

Some Lucentis patients have serious side effects related to the injection. These include serious infections inside the eye, detached retinas, and cataracts. The most common eye-related side effects are increased redness in the white of the eye, eye pain, small specks in vision, and increased eye pressure. The most common non–eye related side effects are nose and throat infections, anemia, nausea and cough.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced results from a second Phase 3 trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab) in patients 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The trial met its co-primary endpoints in patients taking Dupixent 300 mg weekly, showing significant improvements in clinical (Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire) and histologic disease measures compared to placebo. In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with EoE.

""This trial gives insight into how terrible this disease can be, with more than a third of patients having previously required invasive endoscopic dilations that can temporarily reduce symptoms but carry the risk of rupturing the esophagus,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Dupixent, which blocks the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways, has now shown compelling results across a spectrum of diseases where there has been great unmet need. In fact, our positive Phase 3 data in six different diseases help confirm our early hypothesis that IL-4 and IL-13 are the main drivers of allergic or type 2 inflammation and disease, whether manifested in the gastrointestinal tract as eosinophilic esophagitis, the respiratory tract as asthma or nasal polyps, or the skin as atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, or prurigo nodularis.""

EoE is a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. At times, swallowing the smallest quantity of food or taking a sip of water can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. Those with EoE live with anxiety and frustration from having a constantly evolving list of trigger foods to avoid. Dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus, which is used to address narrowing, is often painful. In severe cases, a feeding tube is the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. People with EoE may have poor quality of life and are more likely to experience depression, especially as they age, than people without EoE. In the U.S. there are approximately 160,000 patients with EoE who are currently treated, of whom approximately 48,000 have failed multiple treatments.

""The current standard of care for people with eosinophilic esophagitis may only provide limited relief of their symptoms. Efforts to develop a treatment that targets an underlying cause of the disease has eluded the field for some time, resulting in an incredible unmet need,"" said Naimish Patel, M.D. Head of Global Development, Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""We are encouraged that Dupixent, which targets IL-4 and IL-13, was able to reduce inflammation in the esophagus and provided significant relief when swallowing for patients taking the weekly dose. We look forward to continuing to study Dupixent's potential role in addressing the underlying type 2 inflammation that can lead to eosinophilic esophagitis.""

In this trial, 80 patients were enrolled into a Dupixent 300 mg weekly treatment group and 79 patients were enrolled into the placebo group. The co-primary endpoints at 24 weeks assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire, or DSQ), and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of =6 eos/high power field [hpf]).

Patients treated with Dupixent 300 mg weekly experienced the following changes by week 24 compared to placebo:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>64% reduction in disease symptoms from baseline compared to 41% for placebo (p=0.0008). Dupixent patients experienced a 23.78 point improvement on the 0-84 DSQ scale, compared to a 13.86 point improvement for placebo (p&lt;0.0001); baseline DSQ scores were approximately 38 and 36 points, respectively.</li>
 	<li>Nearly 10 times as many Dupixent patients achieved histological disease remission: 59% of patients achieved histological disease remission compared to 6% of placebo patients (p&lt;0.0001). This was measured by the proportion of patients who achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of =6 eos/hpf; mean baseline peak levels were 89 and 84 eos/hpf, respectively.</li>
</ul>
The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. For the 24-week treatment period, overall rates of adverse events were 84% (67/80) for Dupixent 300 mg weekly and 71% (55/78) for placebo. Adverse events that were more commonly (=5%) observed with Dupixent every week included injection site reactions (38% [30/80] Dupixent, 33% [26/78] placebo), fever (6% [5/80] Dupixent, 1% [1/78] placebo), sinusitis (5% [4/80] Dupixent, 0% [0/78] placebo), COVID-19 (5% [4/80] Dupixent, 0% [0/78] placebo) and hypertension (5% [4/80] Dupixent, 1% [1/78] placebo). No imbalance was observed in rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events between Dupixent (3% [2/80]) and placebo (3% [2/78]) groups prior to week 24.

Detailed results from the trial will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting.

Data from the clinical trial program will be submitted to regulatory authorities by 2022.

Dupixent was granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE in 2017. The potential use of Dupixent in EoE is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

<b>About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis Trial
</b>The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adolescents and adults with EoE. The second trial (Part B) enrolled 240 patients aged 12 years and older with EoE, as determined by histological and patient-reported measures. Following the first Phase 3 trial (Part A), in which Dupixent 300 mg weekly was evaluated compared to placebo, the second confirmatory trial evaluated Dupixent 300 mg weekly or every two weeks compared to placebo for a 24-week treatment period.

The clinical trial program is ongoing, with patients from the first and second trials continuing into a 28-week long-term extension trial (Part C). Full results from this trial will be available in 2022.

<b>About Dupixent
</b>Dupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary <i>VelocImmune<sup>®</sup></i> technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).

Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 300,000 patients have been treated globally.

<b>About Regeneron's VelocImmune Technology
</b>Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune </i>technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3333537-1&amp;h=3713458145&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2F0168952585900897&amp;a=envision"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">envision</a> making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing <i>VelocImmune</i> and related <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup></i> technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used <i>VelocImmune</i> technology to create approximately a quarter of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent, REGEN-COV<sup>®</sup> (casirivimab and imdevimab), Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab), Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), Evkeeza<sup>®</sup> (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb<sup>TM </sup>(atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn).

<b>Dupilumab Development Program
</b>Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.

Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced positive top-line results from two pivotal Phase 3 trials of the investigational, once-daily oral fixed dose combination pill of doravirine/islatravir (DOR/ISL) in adults with HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed on different antiretroviral therapy regimens (ART; ILLUMINATE SWITCH A) or bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir (BIC/FTC/TAF; ILLUMINATE SWITCH B). At 48 weeks, both trials met their primary efficacy endpoint of percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA levels =50 copies/mL, demonstrating that antiviral efficacy was comparable between DOR/ISL and ART (ILLUMINATE SWITCH A) and between DOR/ISL and BIC/FTC/TAF (ILLUMINATE SWITCH B). The safety and tolerability profile of DOR/ISL during the trials to date are consistent with the previously reported Phase 2 studies. Doravirine is approved for the treatment of adults with HIV-1 in combination with other antiretrovirals, as a single agent (PIFELTRO) and a component of a single-tablet regimen (DELSTRIGO; DOR/3TC/TDF). Islatravir is Merck’s investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor under evaluation for the treatment of people living with HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretrovirals. Detailed findings from these studies will be presented at a future scientific congress and will form the basis of global regulatory applications.

“Merck is committed to investigating potential treatment options to help address the evolving needs of people living with HIV,” said Dr. Joan Butterton, vice president, global clinical development, infectious diseases, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are encouraged by the results from the Phase 3 ILLUMINATE SWITCH A and B trials, in which the DOR/ISL dual regimen efficacy was comparable to certain commonly used three-drug regimens. We will continue to study doravirine/islatravir in diverse populations of people living with HIV and look forward to sharing data from these trials.”

The ILLUMINATE clinical trial program is evaluating DOR/ISL in a broad patient population, which includes people with HIV-1 who are virologically suppressed on ART, those who are heavily treatment experienced and those who are new to HIV treatment. The clinical trial program also includes pediatric participants with HIV-1 weighing at least 35 kg who are virologically suppressed and have not previously been treated. Merck is committed to enrolling diverse people in our HIV-1 clinical trials, especially among communities who may be disproportionately impacted by HIV, such as women and those within the Black and Latinx communities.

<b>Indications and Usage for PIFELTRO and DELSTRIGO</b>

PIFELTRO (doravirine, 100 mg) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients with no prior ARV treatment history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to doravirine.

DELSTRIGO (doravirine, 100 mg/lamivudine 300 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 300 mg) is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients with no prior ARV treatment history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of DELSTRIGO. DELSTRIGO contains a boxed warning regarding post-treatment acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (HBV) infection. See Selected Safety Information below.

<b>Selected Safety Information about PIFELTRO and DELSTRIGO</b>

<i>Warning: Posttreatment Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B (HBV)</i>

All patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of HBV before initiating ARV therapy. Severe acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), which are components of DELSTRIGO. Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue DELSTRIGO should be monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping DELSTRIGO. If appropriate, initiation of anti-HBV therapy may be warranted.

PIFELTRO and DELSTRIGO are contraindicated when co-administered with drugs that are strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A enzyme inducers (including the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin; the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide; the antimycobacterials rifampin and rifapentine; the cytotoxic agent mitotane; and the herbal product St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)), as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations may occur, which may decrease the effectiveness of DELSTRIGO and PIFELTRO.

DELSTRIGO is contraindicated in patients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to lamivudine.

Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, have been reported with the use of TDF. DELSTRIGO should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (eg, high-dose or multiple NSAIDs). Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF.

Prior to or when initiating DELSTRIGO, and during treatment, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue DELSTRIGO in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Discontinue DELSTRIGO if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL/min.

In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, TDF was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher. Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported with the use of TDF.

Immune reconstitution syndrome can occur, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.

Because DELSTRIGO is a complete regimen, co-administration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended.

Co-administration of PIFELTRO with efavirenz, etravirine, or nevirapine is not recommended.

If DELSTRIGO is co-administered with rifabutin, take one tablet of DELSTRIGO once daily, followed by one tablet of doravirine (PIFELTRO) approximately 12 hours after the dose of DELSTRIGO.

If PIFELTRO is co-administered with rifabutin, increase PIFELTRO dosage to one tablet twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart).

Consult the full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for more information on potential drug-drug interactions.

Because DELSTRIGO is a fixed-dose combination tablet and the dosage of lamivudine and TDF cannot be adjusted, DELSTRIGO is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min.

The most common adverse reactions with DELSTRIGO (incidence =5%, all intensities) were dizziness (7%), nausea (5%), and abnormal dreams (5%). The most common adverse reactions with PIFELTRO (incidence =5%, all intensities) were nausea (7%), dizziness (7%), headache (6%), fatigue (6%), diarrhea (6%), abdominal pain (5%), and abnormal dreams (5%).

By Week 96 in DRIVE-FORWARD, 2% of adult subjects in the PIFELTRO group and 3% in the DRV+r group had adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication.

By Week 96 in DRIVE-AHEAD, 3% of adult subjects in the DELSTRIGO group and 7% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group had adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication.

In DRIVE-FORWARD, mean changes from baseline at Week 48 in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were pre-specified. LDL-C: -4.6 mg/dL in the PIFELTRO group vs 9.5 mg/dL in the DRV+r group. Non-HDL-C: -5.4 mg/dL in the PIFELTRO group vs 13.7 mg/dL in the DRV+r group. The clinical benefits of these findings have not been demonstrated.

In DRIVE-AHEAD, mean changes from baseline at Week 48 in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were pre-specified. LDL-C: -2.1 mg/dL in the DELSTRIGO group vs 8.3 mg/dL in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. Non-HDL-C: -4.1 mg/dL in the DELSTRIGO group vs 12.7 mg/dL in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. The clinical benefits of these findings have not been demonstrated.

In DRIVE-SHIFT, mean changes from baseline at Week 48 in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were pre-specified. LDL-C: -16.3 mg/dL in the DELSTRIGO group vs -2.6 mg/dL in the PI + ritonavir group. Non-HDL-C: -24.8 mg/dL DELSTRIGO group vs -2.1 mg/dL in the PI + ritonavir group. The clinical benefits of these findings have not been demonstrated.

In DRIVE-AHEAD, neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported in the three pre-specified categories of sleep disorders and disturbances, dizziness, and altered sensorium. Twelve percent of adult subjects in the DELSTRIGO group and 26% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group reported neuropsychiatric adverse events of sleep disorders and disturbances; 9% in the DELSTRIGO group and 37% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group reported dizziness; and 4% in the DELSTRIGO group and 8% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group reported altered sensorium.

The safety of DELSTRIGO in virologically-suppressed adults was based on Week 48 data from subjects in the DRIVE-SHIFT trial. Overall, the safety profile in virologically-suppressed adult subjects was similar to that in subjects with no ARV treatment history.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to PIFELTRO or DELSTRIGO during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.

Mothers infected with HIV-1 should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving PIFELTRO or DELSTRIGO due to the potential for HIV-1 transmission.

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has initiated a rolling review for molnupiravir, an investigational oral antiviral medicine, for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. Merck plans to work with the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to complete the rolling review process to facilitate initiating the formal review of the Marketing Authorization Application. As previously <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-and-ridgeback-announce-submission-of-emergency-use-authorization-application-to-the-u-s-fda-for-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-medicine-for-the-treatment-of-mild-to-moderate-c%2F&amp;esheet=52514379&amp;newsitemid=20211025005204&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=1&amp;md5=c1ff13aa795456a51a16681b080d9e96"" rel=""nofollow"">announced</a>, Merck has submitted an application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is actively working to submit applications to other regulatory agencies worldwide.

“This application to the EMA is another step in our efforts to bring molnupiravir forward to patients globally,” said Dr. Dean Y. Li, executive vice president and president, Merck Research Laboratories. “We believe that molnupiravir will be an important addition to the range of public health tools to fight COVID-19 – including the vaccines developed by the research-based pharmaceutical industry, which remain essential and are the first-line of defense against this pandemic.”

The submission is based on <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-and-ridgebacks-investigational-oral-antiviral-molnupiravir-reduced-the-risk-of-hospitalization-or-death-by-approximately-50-percent-compared-to-placebo-for-patients-with-mild-or-moderat%2F&amp;esheet=52514379&amp;newsitemid=20211025005204&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=positive+results+from+a+planned+interim+analysis&amp;index=2&amp;md5=30e3fea85fd7f56eff2ebfbb2c8e9bee"" rel=""nofollow"">positive results from a planned interim analysis</a> from the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT clinical trial, which evaluated molnupiravir in non-hospitalized adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. At the interim analysis, molnupiravir 800 mg twice-daily reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50%; 7.3% of patients who received molnupiravir were hospitalized through Day 29 following randomization (28/385), compared with 14.1% of placebo-treated patients (53/377) that were either hospitalized or died; p=0.0012. Through Day 29, no deaths were reported in patients who received molnupiravir, as compared to 8 deaths in patients who received placebo. The incidence of any adverse event was comparable in the molnupiravir and placebo groups (35% and 40%, respectively). The incidence of drug-related adverse events was also comparable (12% and 11%, respectively), and fewer patients in the molnupiravir group discontinued therapy due to an adverse event compared to the placebo group (1.3% and 3.4%, respectively).

“In the nearly two years since COVID-19 emerged, the global scientific community has made extraordinary strides in developing several critical vaccines and treatments, but we still have a need for an oral antiviral medicine that can be taken at home,” said Wendy Holman, chief executive officer, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. “We believe that molnupiravir, with the exciting finding of reduction in hospitalization and death in the MOVe-OUT study, may help fill that need and look forward to working with the EMA on its review.”

<b>About Merck’s Efforts to Enable Global Access to Molnupiravir, if it is Granted Authorization or Approval</b>

In anticipation of the results from MOVe-OUT and the potential for regulatory authorization or approval, Merck has been producing molnupiravir at risk and expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by the end of 2021, with even more courses expected to be produced in 2022.

On October 11, Merck and Ridgeback <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-and-ridgeback-announce-submission-of-emergency-use-authorization-application-to-the-u-s-fda-for-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-medicine-for-the-treatment-of-mild-to-moderate-c%2F&amp;esheet=52514379&amp;newsitemid=20211025005204&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=3&amp;md5=9ff2d69fb5913eb83fe56671b065fcc2"" rel=""nofollow"">announced</a> that Merck had submitted an application for EUA to the U.S. FDA for molnupiravir for the treatment of at-risk adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Additional submissions to global regulatory agencies are underway.

Earlier this year, Merck <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-announces-supply-agreement-with-u-s-government-for-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-candidate-for-treatment-of-mild-to-moderate-covid-19%2F&amp;esheet=52514379&amp;newsitemid=20211025005204&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=entered&amp;index=4&amp;md5=2804eb70189bc4e700c9a0c1bf825088"" rel=""nofollow"">entered</a> into a procurement agreement with the U.S. Government under which the company will supply approximately 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir to the U.S. Government following EUA or approval from the U.S. FDA. Additionally, Merck has entered into supply and advance purchase agreements for molnupiravir with other governments worldwide, pending regulatory authorization, and is currently in discussions with additional governments.

Merck is committed to providing timely access to molnupiravir globally, if it is authorized or approved, and plans to implement a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria that reflect countries’ relative ability to finance their health response to the pandemic.

As part of its commitment to widespread global access, Merck previously <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Famid-humanitarian-crisis-in-india-merck-announces-voluntary-licensing-agreements-with-five-indian-generics-manufacturers-to-accelerate-and-expand-global-access-to-molnupiravir-an-investigational-ora%2F&amp;esheet=52514379&amp;newsitemid=20211025005204&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=5&amp;md5=fc95aeed2bc74301fdd5cf5750a4d1e5"" rel=""nofollow"">announced</a> that the company has entered into non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for molnupiravir with established Indian generic manufacturers to accelerate availability of molnupiravir in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. Merck continues to discuss additional measures and collaborations to accelerate broad, global access to molnupiravir.

<b>About Molnupiravir</b>

Molnupiravir (MK-4482 and EIDD-2801) is an investigational, orally administered form of a potent ribonucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Molnupiravir has been shown to be active in several preclinical models of SARS-CoV-2, including for prophylaxis, treatment, and prevention of transmission. Additionally, pre-clinical and clinical data have shown molnupiravir to be active against the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Molnupiravir was invented at Drug Innovations at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, a not-for-profit biotechnology company wholly owned by Emory University; Emory/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Molnupiravir is being developed by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of molnupiravir have been provided by Merck and by Wayne and Wendy Holman of Ridgeback.

Molnupiravir is also being evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis in MOVe-AHEAD, a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households.

<b>About the MOVe-OUT Study</b>

The MOVe-OUT trial (MK-4482-002) (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04575597%3Fterm%3Dmolnupiravir%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&amp;esheet=52514379&amp;newsitemid=20211025005204&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT04575597&amp;index=7&amp;md5=9d758f21d7840e57ed1166b026826acc"" rel=""nofollow"">NCT04575597</a>) is a global Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study of non-hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Patients enrolled in the study were unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, had at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes, and symptom onset within five days prior to randomization. The primary efficacy objective of MOVe-OUT is to evaluate the efficacy of molnupiravir 800 mg twice daily for five days compared to placebo as assessed by the percentage of participants who are hospitalized and/or die from the time of randomization through Day 29.

The Phase 3 portion of the MOVe-OUT trial was conducted globally, including in more than 170 planned sites in countries including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. For further information about the MOVe-OUT trial, please visit <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04575597%3Fterm%3Dmolnupiravir%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&amp;esheet=52514379&amp;newsitemid=20211025005204&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=clinicaltrials.gov&amp;index=8&amp;md5=47d9b42359d449e8e4bf5fb26d0599fd"" rel=""nofollow"">clinicaltrials.gov</a>.

The most common risk factors for poor disease outcome included obesity, older age (&gt;60 years), diabetes mellitus and heart disease. Delta, Gamma and Mu variants accounted for nearly 80% of the baseline viral variants that had been sequenced at the time of the interim analysis. Recruitment in Latin America, Europe, and Africa accounted for 56%, 23% and 15% of the study population, respectively.

Novartis announced today that the CANOPY-1 Phase III study did not demonstrate the statistically significant primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with canakinumab (ACZ885) combined with pembrolizumab plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, compared to patients receiving placebo in combination with pembrolizumab plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy<sup>1</sup>. The trial data, however, showed potentially clinically meaningful improvements in both PFS and OS in pre-specified subgroups of patients based on the baseline inflammatory biomarker, hs-CRP, as well as other biomarker-defined subgroups. These data support further evaluation of canakunimab in lung cancer.

“CANOPY-1 provides critical insights into the treatment of this devastating disease, and we will continue to analyze the data and conclusions, as well as their potential clinical implications,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “While this trial did not confirm the benefit for all patients we hoped for, we are energized by the overall CANOPY-1 findings as they support our commitment to continue studying canakinumab in lung cancer. We share our gratitude and thanks to the CANOPY-1 study patients and clinical investigators for their partnership.”

Novartis and investigators are collaborating on further data analysis and will present the full dataset at an upcoming medical meeting. The company is continuing with the evaluation of canakinumab in lung cancer, and is applying findings to the overall lung cancer development plan.

The comprehensive CANOPY clinical trial program continues with CANOPY-A, a Phase III study investigating canakinumab as an adjuvant therapy (after surgery)<sup>2</sup>, and CANOPY-N, a Phase II study in the neoadjuvant setting (before surgery)<sup>5</sup>. Enrollment for both trials is ongoing<sup>2,</sup><sup>5</sup>. Patients in the CANOPY-A trial more closely reflect the earlier CANTOS study population than those in the CANOPY-1 trial<sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>4</sup>. CANTOS was the first study to show that blocking the IL-1ß inflammatory signal may potentially reduce lung cancer’s incidence and mortality<sup>3</sup>.

Canakinumab is a potential first-in-class interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß) inhibitor of the Pro-Tumor Inflammation (PTI) pathway in NSCLC<sup>6</sup>. PTI, which enables tumor development by driving cancer-causing processes and suppressing anti-tumor immune responses, is one of the potential hallmarks of cancer and targets in NSCLC<sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>6</sup>. Novartis is developing other potential PTI pathway inhibitors, which are at various stages of development, including gevokizumab<sup>7</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>8</sup>.

<strong>About canakinumab (ACZ885)</strong>
Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and selectivity to human interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß) and neutralizes IL-1ß activity by blocking its interaction with its receptors<sup>9</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>10</sup>. By neutralizing IL-1ß, preliminary evidence suggests that canakinumab may inhibit Pro-Tumor Inflammation (PTI) to 1) enhance anti-tumor immune response; 2) reduce tumor cell proliferation, survival, and invasiveness; and 3) impair angiogenesis<sup>11</sup>. PTI enables tumor development by driving cancer-causing processes and suppressing anti-tumor immune responses<sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>6</sup>. Canakinumab is a potential first-in-class IL-1ß inhibitor of the PTI pathway in NSCLC<sup>6</sup>.

<strong>About the CANOPY program</strong>
Novartis launched the CANOPY study program after observing significantly lower than expected rates of lung cancer mortality among patients in the Phase III cardiovascular CANTOS trial. The CANTOS trial evaluated canakinumab as a secondary prevention measure for cardiovascular events in patients following a heart attack<sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>11</sup>. Patients in the CANTOS trial also were at high risk for inflammatory cancers, like lung cancer, due to advanced age, smoking history, and other clinical risk factors<sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>11</sup>. Based on these findings, Novartis launched three large-scale, randomized, Phase III clinical trials and a Phase II clinical trial to investigate canakinumab as a potential treatment option in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
<ul>
 	<li><strong>CANOPY-A (NCT03447769</strong><strong>)</strong> is a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial studying canakinumab in the adjuvant setting following surgical resection and cisplatin-based chemotherapy, if required<sup>2</sup>. The adjuvant study is designed to determine if treatment with canakinumab can prevent cancer relapse<sup>2</sup>.</li>
 	<li><strong>CANOPY-N (NCT03968419</strong><strong>)</strong> is a Phase II neoadjuvant trial evaluating canakinumab either as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab among patients with resectable NSCLC prior to their planned surgery<sup>5</sup>.</li>
 	<li><strong>CANOPY-1 (NCT03631199)</strong> was a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial evaluating canakinumab as a first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy<sup>4</sup>. As reported today, the trial did not met its primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)<sup>1</sup>.</li>
 	<li><strong>CANOPY-2 (NCT03626545</strong>) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial investigating the role of canakinumab in combination with the chemotherapy agent docetaxel in second- or third-line therapy versus docetaxel alone in NSCLC<sup>12</sup>. In March 2021, Novartis announced that the trial did not meet its primary endpoint, and data were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2021 Congress<sup>13</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Novartis and lung cancer</strong>
Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, accounting for more than 2 million new cases diagnosed each year<sup>14</sup>. More people die of lung cancer every year than any other cancer<sup>14</sup>. There are two main types of lung cancer—small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)<sup>15</sup>. NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer diagnoses<sup>14</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>16</sup>.

Novartis is committed to working with the scientific and medical communities to reimagine the treatment of lung cancer and pursue advances in medicine that could extend the survival of people living with lung cancer. With one of the most diverse lung cancer development programs in the industry, Novartis is: developing experimental therapies that block cancer growth; learning more about ways to activate the body’s immune system; increasing understanding of the relationship between chronic inflammation and tumor growth and progression; and exploring the potential for advanced nuclear medicine to fight the disease. As part of this continuing and broad commitment to targeting lung cancer, data from CANOPY-1 will be evaluated and used to inform canakinumab’s future development program, including potential combination studies with tislelizumab.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) today announced that a second clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement has been entered with a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ., USA (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada) to evaluate the combination of datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ., USA’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab).

Under the terms of the agreement between Daiichi Sankyo and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ., USA, Daiichi Sankyo will lead TROPION-Lung08, a global phase 3 trial that will evaluate datopotamab deruxtecan in combination with KEYTRUDA compared to KEYTRUDA alone in treatment-naïve patients with PD-L1 high advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without actionable genomic alterations, on behalf of the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca collaboration. Additional details of the agreement were not disclosed.

Current standard of care in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC without actionable genomic alterations is PD-L1 immunotherapy with or without platinum-based chemotherapy.<sup>1</sup> While these therapies can improve survival in this subtype of NSCLC, at least 40 to 60% of tumors do not respond to initial treatment and disease progression occurs, underscoring the need for new innovative treatment approaches.<sup>2,3,4,5</sup>

“Entering into this second clinical trial collaboration is based on encouraging results in an ongoing phase 1b study and advances development of datopotamab deruxtecan into a phase 3 study in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&amp;D, Daiichi Sankyo. “In this specific trial, we will evaluate whether combining our TROP2 directed ADC with an anti-PD-1 therapy improves outcomes in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer with no actionable genomic alterations.”

“While PD-L1 immunotherapy can improve outcomes in advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, the progression-free survival for the majority of patients is still less than one year,” said Cristian Massacesi, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Oncology Chief Development Officer, AstraZeneca. “The TROPION-Lung08 trial will evaluate whether the combination of datopotamab deruxtecan and an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the PD-1 pathway will improve outcomes in this setting.”

<b>About TROPION-Lung08
</b>TROPION-Lung08 is a global, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of datopotamab deruxtecan and KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA alone in treatment-naïve patients with PD-L1 high advanced or metastatic NSCLC without actionable genomic alterations (e.g., EGFR, ALK, ROS1, NTRK, BRAF, RET, MET or other known actionable mutations). The primary endpoints of TROPION-Lung08 are progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR), and overall survival (OS). TROPION-Lung08 is expected to enroll approximately 740 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.

KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp, a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, U.S.A.

<b>About Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
</b>Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with 80 to 85% classified as NSCLC.<sup>6,7,8</sup> NSCLC is diagnosed at an advanced stage in more than 50% of patients and often has a poor prognosis with worsening outcomes after each line of subsequent therapy.<sup>9,10,11</sup>

While the introduction of targeted therapies and checkpoint inhibitors in recent years have improved outcomes for patients with advanced NSCLC, the majority of tumors do not have known actionable genomic alterations.<sup>12</sup> Current standard of care in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC without actionable genomic alterations is immunotherapy with or without platinum-based chemotherapy, based upon PD-L1 expression.<sup>1</sup> While these therapies may improve survival, at least 40 to 60% of tumors do not respond to initial treatment and disease progression occurs, underscoring the need for new innovative treatment approaches.<sup>2,3,4,5</sup>

<b>About TROP2
</b>TROP2 (trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is widely expressed in several types of solid tumors, including NSCLC.<sup>13,14</sup> Research indicates that TROP2 expression is associated with increased tumor progression and poor overall and disease free survival in several types of solid tumors.<sup>13,14</sup> While TROP2 is expressed across all lung cancer subtypes, results from one NSCLC study demonstrated TROP2 expression in all adenocarcinoma cases and 92% of squamous cell carcinoma cases (the most common forms of NSCLC), while a separate study found high TROP2 expression in 64% of adenocarcinoma and 75% of squamous cell carcinoma cases.<sup>13,14 </sup>No TROP2 directed therapies are currently approved for the treatment of patients with NSCLC.<sup>15</sup>

<b>About Datopotamab Deruxtecan
</b>Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of three lead ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti-TROP2 IgG1<sup>3</sup> monoclonal antibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker.<sup>16</sup>

A comprehensive development program called TROPION is underway globally with trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple solid tumors, including NSCLC, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), HR positive/HER2 negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, urothelial, gastric and esophageal cancer. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.

<b>About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration
</b>Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize datopotamab deruxtecan in <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.daiichisankyo.com%2Fmedia%2Fpress_release%2Fdetail%2Findex_3126.html&amp;esheet=52513472&amp;newsitemid=20211025005113&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=July+2020&amp;index=3&amp;md5=81622ec582c29690c6225e61d748e901"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">July 2020</a>, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights.

<p align=""left""> Evaxion Biotech A/S (NASDAQ: EVAX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of AI-driven immunotherapies to improve the lives of patients with cancer and infectious diseases, announced today that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with subsidiaries of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), to evaluate the combination of Evaxion’s cancer immunotherapy EVX-01 with MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in a new Phase 2b study.</p>
The planned multicenter Phase 2b trial will enroll patients with metastatic melanoma stage III and stage IV and will investigate the personalized neoepitope immunotherapy EVX-01 in combination with KEYTRUDA®. It is expected to be initiated in Q4 2021. Under terms of the agreement, Evaxion will be responsible for the conduct of the study; MSD will supply all of the necessary KEYTRUDA® and will continue to collaborate as the data mature.

<strong>Lars Wegner, CEO of Evaxion</strong>, said: “We are extremely proud to collaborate with MSD, one of the world’s premier immuno-oncology companies, on our upcoming Phase 2b trial with EVX-01. The promising Phase 1/2a data, which we reported in July, showed that EVX-01 may be able to improve the treatment landscape in melanoma and potentially other cancers. Now that checkpoint inhibitors including KEYTRUDA® have become the standard of care for these patients, we are excited about the potential additive benefits of our drug candidate to further improve treatment and to strengthen the evidence supporting our platform and clinical pipeline. Futhermore, this collaboration will also reduce the cost of conducting our Phase 2b trial on EVX-01.”

The ongoing Phase 1/2a trial is investigating EVX-01, a novel personalized cancer neoepitope immunotherapy based on Evaxion’s proprietary PIONEER® AI technology, for the treatment of patients with melanoma.

KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.

Positive high-level results from the TOPAZ-1 Phase III trial showed <i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab), in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) benefit versus chemotherapy alone as a 1st-line treatment for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC).

At a predefined interim analysis, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee concluded that the trial met the primary endpoint by demonstrating an improvement in OS in patients treated with <i>Imfinzi </i>plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The combination also demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate, key secondary endpoints.

<i>Imfinzi </i>plus chemotherapy was well tolerated, had a similar safety profile versus the comparator arm and did not increase the discontinuation rate due to adverse events compared to chemotherapy alone. <i> </i>

BTC is a group of rare and aggressive cancers that occur in the bile ducts and gallbladder.<sup>1,2</sup> Incidence of BTC often depends on the prevalence of common risk factors for each type within a geographical region.

Approximately 50,000 people in the US, Europe and Japan and about 210,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with BTC each year.<sup>3-5</sup> These patients have a poor prognosis, with approximately only 5% to 15% of all patients with BTC surviving five years.<sup>4</sup> In December 2020, <i>Imfinzi</i> was granted Orphan Drug Designation in the US for the treatment of BTC.

Do-Youn Oh, MD, PhD, Professor, Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine at Seoul National University Hospital and Seoul National University College of Medicine, and principal investigator in the TOPAZ-1 Phase III trial, said: “Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer are in dire need of new treatments as progress in the 1st-line setting has remained largely stagnant for more than 10 years. TOPAZ-1 is the first Phase III trial to show that adding an immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy delivers a meaningful overall survival benefit for patients in this setting. Today’s exciting results are a major step forward in treating this disease and represent new hope for our patients.”

Susan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, AstraZeneca, said: “We are delighted TOPAZ-1 has been unblinded early due to clear evidence of efficacy for <i>Imfinzi </i>plus chemotherapy, which has also demonstrated a strong safety profile. We have now delivered two positive gastrointestinal cancer trials in a row for <i>Imfinzi</i>, following the HIMALAYA trial in liver cancer. We believe the significant survival benefit demonstrated marks a new era of immunotherapy treatment in this devastating disease, and it advances our commitment to improving long-term survival for patients across these cancers where treatment options are limited.”

The data will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting and shared with health authorities.

<b><u>Notes</u></b>

<b>Biliary tract cancer
</b>Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a group of rare and aggressive gastrointestinal (GI) cancers that form in the cells of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma), gallbladder or ampulla of Vater (where the bile duct and pancreatic duct connect to the small intestine).<sup>1,2</sup> Cholangiocarcinoma is more common in China and Thailand and is on the rise in Western countries.<sup>8-10</sup> Gallbladder cancer is more common in certain regions of South America, India and Japan.<sup>11,12</sup>

Apart from ampullary cancer, early-stage BTC often presents without symptoms and most new cases of BTC are therefore diagnosed at an advanced stage, when treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor.<sup>13,14</sup>

<b>TOPAZ-1
</b>TOPAZ-1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre, global Phase III trial of <i>Imfinzi</i> in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin) versus placebo in combination with chemotherapy as a 1st-line treatment in 685 patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic BTC including intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancer (ampullary carcinoma was excluded).

The trial is being conducted in more than 145 centres across 17 countries including in the US, Europe, South America and several countries in Asia including South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and China. The primary endpoint is OS and key secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, objective response rate and safety.

<b><i>Imfinzi
</i></b><i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-L1 protein and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 and CD80 proteins, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

<i>Imfinzi</i> is the only approved immunotherapy in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients whose disease has not progressed after chemoradiation therapy and is the global standard of care in this setting based on the PACIFIC Phase III trial.

<i>Imfinzi</i> is also approved in the US, EU, Japan, China and many other countries around the world for the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) based on the CASPIAN Phase III trial.

<i>Imfinzi</i> is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in several countries. Since the first approval in May 2017, more than 100,000 patients have been treated with <i>Imfinzi</i>.

As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi </i>is being tested as a single treatment and in combinations with other anti-cancer treatments for patients with SCLC, NSCLC, bladder cancer, liver cancer, BTC, oesophageal cancer, gastric and gastroesophageal cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and other solid tumours.

<b>AstraZeneca in GI cancers
</b>AstraZeneca has a broad development programme for the treatment of GI cancers across several medicines and a variety of tumour types and stages of disease. In 2020, GI cancers collectively represented approximately 5.1 million new cancer cases leading to approximately 3.6 million deaths.<sup>15</sup>

Within this programme, the Company is committed to improving outcomes in gastric, liver, BTC, oesophageal, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers.

<i>Imfinzi</i> is being assessed in combinations in liver, BTC, oesophageal and gastric cancers in an extensive development programme spanning early to late-stage disease. In October 2021, the <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/imfinzi-and-tremelimumab-improved-os-in-liver-cancer.html"">HIMALAYA</a> Phase III trial in 1st-line unresectable liver cancer met its primary endpoint of overall survival with the STRIDE regimen, a single, high priming dose of tremelimumab plus <i>Imfinzi </i>every four weeks versus sorafenib.

The Company aims to understand the potential of<i> Enhertu </i>(trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate, in the two most common GI cancers, colorectal and gastric cancers.<i> Enhertu</i> is jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo.

<i>Lynparza </i>(olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor with a broad and advanced clinical trial programme across multiple GI tumour types including pancreatic and colorectal cancers. <i>Lynparza </i>is developed and commercialised in collaboration with MSD (Merck &amp; Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada).

<b>AstraZeneca in immunotherapy
</b>Immunotherapy is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s Immuno-Oncology (IO) portfolio is anchored in immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes <i>Imfinzi</i> as a single treatment and in combination with tremelimumab and other novel antibodies in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of treatment, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient.

In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, targeted small molecules from across AstraZeneca’s oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

<b>AstraZeneca in oncology
</b>AstraZeneca is leading a revolution in oncology with the ambition to provide cures for cancer in every form, following the science to understand cancer and all its complexities to discover, develop and deliver life-changing medicines to patients.

The Company's focus is on some of the most challenging cancers. It is through persistent innovation that AstraZeneca has built one of the most diverse portfolios and pipelines in the industry, with the potential to catalyse changes in the practice of medicine and transform the patient experience.

AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer care and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

<b>AstraZeneca
</b>AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialisation of prescription medicines in Oncology, Rare Diseases, and BioPharmaceuticals, including Cardiovascular, Renal &amp; Metabolism, and Respiratory &amp; Immunology.

Moderna Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced positive interim data from the Phase 2/3 study, called the KidCOVE study, of mRNA-1273, the Company’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19, in children 6 to under 12 years of age. This interim analysis showed a robust neutralizing antibody response after two doses of mRNA-1273 at the 50 µg dose level with a favorable safety profile. Moderna plans to submit these data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global regulators in the near term.

“We are encouraged by the immunogenicity and safety profile of mRNA-1273 in children aged 6 to under 12 years and are pleased that the study met its primary immunogenicity endpoints,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “We look forward to filing with regulators globally and remain committed to doing our part to help end the COVID-19 pandemic with a vaccine for adults and children of all ages.”

KidCOVE is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity and effectiveness of two 50 µg doses of mRNA-1273 given to healthy children 28 days apart. The study population is divided into 3 age groups (6 to &lt;12 years, 2 to &lt;6 years, and 6 months to &lt;2 years). Today Moderna reports on the 6 to under 12 years of age cohort.

This cohort enrolled 4,753 participants who were 6 to less than 12 years of age. In the trial, the SARS-Cov-2-neutralizing antibody geometric mean ratio (GMR) comparing the response in children to the response in young adults from the Phase 3 COVE study was 1.5 (95% Cl: 1.3, 1.8), with a seroresponse rate of 99.3%, representing a difference of 0.6% (95% CI: -2.8%, 2.8%) to the Phase 3 benchmark. These results demonstrate strong immune response in this cohort of children one month after the second dose and met the co-primary immunogenicity endpoints for 6 to less than 12 years olds in KidCOVE.

mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated with a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent with the Phase 3 COVE study in adolescents and adults. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common solicited adverse events were fatigue, headache, fever, and injection site pain.

Safety data continue to accrue, and the study continues to be monitored by an independent safety monitoring committee. All participants will be monitored for 12 months after their second injection to assess long-term protection and safety. These data are subject to change based on ongoing data collection. The Company plans to submit data from the KidCOVE study to a peer-reviewed publication.

The enrollment for the 6 years to under 12 years is complete, but the Phase 2/3 study continues to enroll children ages 6 months to under 6 years of age.

<article class=""news-release carousel-template""><section class=""release-body container "">
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited (Glenmark), a research-led global pharmaceutical company has launched a fixed dose combination (FDC) of its novel, patent protected, globally researched Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter Inhibitor (SGLT2i) - Remogliflozin Etabonate and another widely used DPP4 inhibitor (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 inhibitor) – Vildagliptin, with Metformin (first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes). This fixed drug combination is indicated for the management of Type 2 diabetes. The combination contain<b>s</b> Remogliflozin (100 mg) + Vildagliptin (50 mg) + Metformin (500/1000 mg) in a fixed dose and must be taken twice daily to improve glycemic control in patients. Glenmark has launched the same under two brand names Remo MV and Remozen MV.

Glenmark is the first company in the world to launch Remogliflozin + Vildagliptin + Metformin fixed dose combination (FDC) and <span class=""xn-location"">India</span> is the first country to get access to this FDC drug. Glenmark received approval from the DCGI (the drug approval authority in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>) for manufacturing and marketing this fixed dose combination in late <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2021</span>.

Globally, SGLT2 inhibitors &amp; DPP4 inhibitors are emerging as the preferred treatment option for the management of Type 2 diabetes. Glenmark has been at the forefront in providing access to the latest treatments at a low cost for patients with diabetes in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>.

Glenmark's FDC of Remogliflozin + Vildagliptin + Metformin tackles most of the pathophysiology in Type 2 Diabetes that makes it an appealing fixed dose combination in managing uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes. Mono components of the FDC are recommended by AACE guideline for early use in the hierarchy of Anti diabetic medications for management of Type 2 diabetes. Further, FDC of SGLT2i + DPP4i + Metformin is currently first &amp; only triple drug FDC considered rational for approval by US FDA.

In chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes, patients are required to consume multiple anti-diabetic drugs for prolonged periods of time. Moreover, in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>, patients have to bear the drug cost on their own and so the price of the drug becomes a major factor that impacts treatment adherence. While the average daily cost of therapy of existing brands in the same drug category (when clubbed together for price comparison) is around Rs. 75, Glenmark's Remogliflozin + Vildagiptin + Metformin combination has been launched at a breakthrough price of Rs. 16.50 per tablet, to be taken twice daily; which amounts to <span class=""xn-money"">Rs.33</span>.00 as the per day cost of therapy. This cost is atleast 53% lower than the other available SGLT2 &amp; DPP4 combination drugs administered along with Metformin, in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span><sup>1</sup>.

Glenmark's Remogliflozin + Vildagliptin + Metformin combination will significantly improve access and bring a world class and well researched combination product at an affordable price to patients in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>. This combination has been approved by the DCGI, the drug regulator in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span> for adults aged 18 years and older with Type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control when metformin and one of the mono-components of fixed dose combination do not provide adequate glycemic control, or when already being treated with separate doses of Remogliflozin, Vildagliptin and Metformin.

<b><i>""Globally, SGLT2i + DPP4i + Metformin FDCs are emerging as a preferred treatment for management of type-2 diabetes. Diabetes is a key focus area for Glenmark and we have been at the forefront in providing access to the latest treatment options to diabetes patients in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>. We are proud to introduce this innovative fixed dose combination, which is cutting-edge, extensively researched, at an affordable cost and will significantly improve patient compliance and provide glycemic &amp; extra glycemic benefits to patients with uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes, in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span><span id=""spanHghlt3be8"">,</span>""</i></b><b><i> said Mr. <span class=""xn-person"">Alok Malik</span>, Group Vice President &amp; Business Head, India Formulations.</i></b>

In 2015, Glenmark revolutionized the diabetes market by launching its DPP4 inhibitor – Teneligliptin at a price that was approximately 55% lower than the other DPP4 inhibitors available in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span> at that time. Continuing the legacy, Glenmark launched its globally researched, innovator molecule Remogliflozin in 2019, at a price around 55% lesser than other SGLT2 inhibitors available in the Indian market at that time. In 2020, Glenmark became the first company in the world to launch Remogliflozin (100 mg) + Vildagliptin (50 mg) Fixed Dose Combination (FDC).

According to the <b>International Diabetes Federation (IDF),</b> the prevalence of diabetes in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span> is 8.9% with around 77 million adults living with diabetes as of 2019<sup>2</sup>.

-Guardant Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: GH), presents data at the American College of Gastroenterology Annual Scientific Meeting being held from October 22-27, showing its LUNAR-2 blood test, which has been developed to screen average-risk patients for colorectal cancer (CRC), offers optimized sensitivity and specificity in identifying those with early-stage CRC. This study was selected by the ACG Abstract Selection Committee as the recipient of the International Award.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“The clinically meaningful sensitivity and specificity of the LUNAR-2 blood test in detecting CRC, most notably in people with early-stage disease, indicates that it could be a very useful tool in improving patient outcomes.”</p>

In the study, researchers evaluated the LUNAR-2 test in a cohort of 699 patients with early-stage (Stage 1, 2, or 3) CRC and found the test achieved an overall sensitivity of 96% in detecting CRC and 94% specificity. These findings are on par with other currently available modalities, such as stool-based screening.<sup>1 </sup>The limitation of this retrospective study is that the biobanked samples are from individuals with known CRC and 37% of cases had asymptomatic disease.

“We know that the earlier CRC is detected, the better a person’s chances are of surviving it,” said Dr. Hee Cheol Kim, study investigator and Professor of Surgery at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, South Korea. “The clinically meaningful sensitivity and specificity of the LUNAR-2 blood test in detecting CRC, most notably in people with early-stage disease, indicates that it could be a very useful tool in improving patient outcomes.”

A further analysis showed that in patients with Stage 1 and 2 CRC, whereby blood-based detection can be especially challenging, the test offered 93% overall sensitivity. Additionally, the blood-based test identified 90% of patients with asymptomatic Stage 1 or 2 CRC, suggesting the test may have meaningful performance in an average-risk screening population. These findings need to get further validated in a registrational screening trial.

“CRC screening saves lives, but we know that only about two-thirds of individuals get screened for CRC<sup>2</sup> because current options, like a colonoscopy, are invasive and the preparation can be challenging, and other modalities, like stool based testing, have their own challenges to screening adherence,” said AmirAli Talasaz, Guardant Health Co-CEO. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, screening rates have dropped, wellness visits have declined, and postponements of non-emergency medical procedures have made it harder for people to complete life-saving CRC screening. The study results show that the LUNAR-2 test could provide both patients and physicians with an easy-to-use and highly accurate CRC screening alternative in the form of a blood test.”

The LUNAR-2 blood test aims to detect early-stage cancer in screen-eligible asymptomatic adults from a simple blood draw. The ECLIPSE trial (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04136002&amp;esheet=52514476&amp;newsitemid=20211025005441&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT04136002&amp;index=1&amp;md5=d42f80de640610192820fbfa8402b8ca"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT04136002</a>), a registrational study with more than 10,000-patients, is currently underway to evaluate the performance of the LUNAR-2 blood test to detect early-stage colorectal cancer. One of the largest cancer screening studies of its kind, ECLIPSE is expected to complete enrollment in 2021 and, if successful, data will support a pre-market approval (PMA) submission to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted 17 to 0, with 1 abstention, to recommend the FDA grant Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to <12 years of age. VRBPAC is made up of independent experts who advise the FDA on scientific and regulatory matters, including the evaluation of vaccine safety and efficacy.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211026006316/en/

The committee reviewed the totality of scientific evidence shared by the companies, including results from a Phase 2/3 randomized, controlled trial that included ~4,500 children 5 to <12 years of age (2,268 from the original group and 2,379 from the supplemental safety group). Participants in this age group received a two-dose regimen of 10-µg doses administered 21 days apart, one-third of the 30-µg dose used for people 12 years and older. This dose level was carefully selected for use in the trial based on safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data evaluated as part of a dose-ranging study. The Phase 2/3 trial showed a favorable safety profile, robust immune responses and a vaccine efficacy rate of 90.7% in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, measured from 7 days after the second dose. The Data Monitoring Committee for the study has reviewed the data and has not identified any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine.

“We appreciated the opportunity to present our clinical data demonstrating the safety and high efficacy of our COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to under 12 years of age,” said Kathrin U. Jansen, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development, Pfizer. “COVID-19 is an ongoing threat for the more than 28 million young children in this age group in the U.S., as they remain at risk for this infection. About 10% of all weekly U.S. cases occur in children 5 to under 12 years of age with a potential risk of complications. In addition, immunizing children will help to get us closer to herd immunity, with the potential to stem the pandemic sooner. We thank the FDA advisory committee for their review and positive recommendation in support of Emergency Use Authorization to help protect this young population.”

“We are committed to support the ongoing efforts to reduce infections and COVID-19 cases around the world by expanding the population of people protected against COVID-19,” said Özlem Türeci, M.D., Co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of BioNTech. “The clinical data reviewed underline that our vaccine induces a strong immune response in children when Delta was the prevalent strain and thus may contribute to help address this public health crisis.”

The FDA is expected to make its decision in the coming days. If authorized and subsequently recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine will be the first COVID-19 vaccine available for use in children 5 to <12 years of age in the U.S. The companies expect to then begin shipping pediatric vaccine doses immediately, as directed by the U.S. government. Eligible U.S. residents will continue to receive the vaccine for free, consistent with the U.S. government’s commitment to free access to COVID-19 vaccines.

Pfizer and BioNTech have submitted requests for authorization of their COVID-19 vaccine in this age group to other regulators around the world, including the European Medicines Agency. Initial data from the other two age cohorts in the ongoing Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trial in children – those 2 to <5 years of age and those 6 months to <2 years of age – are expected as soon as fourth quarter 2021 or early first quarter 2022.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned or ongoing.

U.S. INDICATION & AUTHORIZED USE

HOW IS THE VACCINE GIVEN?

The vaccine will be given as an injection into the muscle.

Primary Series: The vaccine is administered as a 2-dose series, 3 weeks apart. A third dose may be administered at least 4 weeks after the second dose to individuals who are determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise.

Booster Dose:

A single booster dose of the vaccine may be administered at least 6 months after completion of a primary series to individuals:
65 years of age and older
18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19
18 through 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2
A single booster dose of the vaccine may be administered to certain individuals who have completed primary vaccination with a different authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Individuals should check with their healthcare provider regarding eligibility for, and timing of, the booster dose.
WHAT IS THE INDICATION AND AUTHORIZED USE?

The FDA-approved COMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the FDA-authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide the COVID-19 primary vaccination series or a booster dose.

COMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer for BioNTech.

It is approved as a 2-dose series for prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older.
It is also authorized under EUA to provide:
a two-dose primary series in individuals 12 through 15 years
a third primary series dose in individuals 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise
a single booster dose to the following individuals who have completed a primary series with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY®:
65 years of age and older
18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19
18 through 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2
a single booster dose to eligible individuals who have completed primary vaccination with a different authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Booster eligibility and schedule are based on the labeling information of the vaccine used for the primary series.
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has received EUA from FDA to provide:

a two-dose primary series in individuals 12 years of age and older
a third primary series dose for individuals 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise
a single booster dose to the following individuals who have completed a primary series with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY®:

<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211026005322/en/Vertex-and-Mammoth-Biosciences-Announce-Collaboration-to-Develop-In-Vivo-Gene-Editing-Therapies-for-Serious-Diseases#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
“We believe our novel ultra-small CRISPR systems have the potential to be game changers when it comes to systemic and targeted delivery of <i>in vivo</i> gene-editing therapies,” said Peter Nell, Chief Business Officer and Head of Therapeutic Strategy at Mammoth Biosciences. “The combination of Mammoth’s unique technology with Vertex’s unmatched experience in serious disease research and development will only accelerate programs with the goal of reaching patients with high unmet medical need.”

Driven by its unique protein discovery engine, Mammoth’s CRISPR platform consists of a proprietary toolbox of novel, ultracompact Cas enzymes, including Cas14 and Cas?. The small size of these Mammoth systems, together with further optimized parameters, have the potential to facilitate advanced delivery, which may increase the scope of <i>in vivo</i> gene-editing for genetic diseases.

“Vertex and Mammoth share the same commitment to developing therapies that have the potential to be transformative for people with serious diseases,” said David Altshuler, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. “We look forward to expanding our cell and genetic therapies capabilities with the addition of Mammoth’s ultra-small CRISPR systems for <i>in vivo</i> genome editing, which will provide us with another set of tools to tackle many of the diseases we’re interested in.”

<b><i>About the Collaboration</i></b>

Under the terms of the agreement, Mammoth Biosciences will receive upfront payments of $41 million, including an investment in the form of a convertible note, and is eligible to receive up to $650 million in potential future payments based upon the successful achievement of prespecified research, development and commercial milestones across two potential programs. In addition, Vertex will pay tiered royalties on future net sales on any products that may result from this collaboration.

<p align=""left"">Angion Biomedica Corp. (NASDAQ:ANGN) and Vifor Pharma today announced the Phase 3 trial of Angion’s ANG-3777 did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference from placebo on the primary endpoint (eGFR at 12 months) in the population of deceased donor kidney transplant patients who were at risk for developing delayed graft function (DGF).</p>
ANG-3777 showed a modest but not statistically significant difference in eGFR of 53.3mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> versus 50.4mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> for placebo (2.9 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, p=0.33). In addition, ANG-3777 demonstrated an inconsistent benefit on key secondary endpoints. Based upon these data, it is not expected there is sufficient evidence to support an indication in the studied DGF population.

The statistical analysis plan also included an analysis of only those people who completed the trial, without using a multiple imputation method to account for missing data and intercurrent events. Under this analysis, ANG-3777 showed a difference on 12-month eGFR of 57.1mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> versus 52.2mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> (4.9mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, p=0.06) for placebo. These data are potentially indicative of biologic activity of ANG-3777.

The overall safety profile of ANG-3777 in this trial was consistent with the overall experience in its clinical development program and consistent with the published literature in this patient population.

“We are disappointed in the outcome of this trial. While we saw signals of activity for ANG-3777, we hoped ANG-3777 would robustly demonstrate a benefit for transplant recipients who have no treatment options when their transplants have DGF,” stated Jay Venkatesan, M.D., Angion’s President and CEO. “The totality of the DGF data, together with the CSA-AKI data expected later this year, will inform our clinical strategy with respect to ANG-3777 going forward. I want to extend my special thanks to the patients, their families, and the investigators and their staff members who participated and worked diligently on this trial.”

“Unfortunately, the results of the Phase 3 registrational trial did not confirm as strong of an effect as we hoped for in the interests of patients experiencing DGF after kidney transplantation,” said Dr. Klaus Henning Jensen, Chief Medical Officer of Vifor Pharma. “These kinds of challenges are part of clinical development activities. Our collaboration with Angion and the development of ANG-3777 in cardiac-surgery associated acute kidney injury continues unchanged, with topline data expected later this year.”

This multi-center, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial randomized 253 patients 1:1 to receive ANG-3777 or a placebo treatment dosed once per day for three days. Eligible patients received a deceased donor transplant and were determined to be at risk for delayed graft function by having low urine output (oliguria) for more than 8 consecutive hours post-transplant, reflecting potential graft injury. Twenty-five transplant centers in the U.S. enrolled patients in this Phase 3 registration trial. The primary endpoint was renal function assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with a primary analysis time point of eGFR at twelve months using a pre-specified multiple imputation method.

Angion expects to report cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2021 totaling approximately $100 million, when it reports quarterly earnings in November 2021.

<strong>About ANG-3777</strong>
ANG-3777 is a small molecule designed to mimic the biological activity of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which activates the c-Met cascade of pathways involved in tissue repair and organ repair. ANG-3777 has a substantially longer half-life than HGF. An exploratory Phase 2 trial for the treatment of acute kidney injury associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CSA-AKI) is ongoing with data expected in the fourth quarter of 2021. In November 2020, Vifor Pharma and Angion signed a license agreement for global rights outside Greater China to commercialize ANG-3777 in nephrology indications only.

<strong>About Angion</strong>
Angion is committed to transforming the treatment paradigm for patients suffering from acute organ injuries and fibrotic diseases for which there are no approved medicines or where existing approved medicines have limitations. Angion’s lead product candidate, ANG-3777, is a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mimetic. An exploratory Phase 2 trial of ANG-3777 for the treatment of acute kidney injury associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is ongoing with data expected in the fourth quarter of 2021. Angion is scheduled to begin a Phase 2 trial evaluating ANG-3070, an oral tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor for the treatment of fibrotic disease, in patients with primary proteinuric kidney diseases. Additionally, Angion has preclinical programs for a rho kinase 2 (ROCK2) inhibitor and a CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) inhibitor. For more information, please visit www.angion.com.
