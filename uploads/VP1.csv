<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the key results of the Phase Ib clinical study of mavorixafor in Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (WM).</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paula Ragan:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Our ongoing&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04274738?term=mavorixafor&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Phase 1b clinical trial</em></a><em>&nbsp;is evaluating the safety and initial efficacy of our lead drug candidate mavorixafor, given orally at three different doses (200 mg, 400mg, and 600 mg) in combination with standard of care, ibrutinib, in people living Waldenström’s</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Macroblobulinemia (WM) with confirmed double mutations in the MYD88 and CXCR4 genes.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>WM is a rare blood cancer and a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma which leads to an overproduction of a type of immunoglobulin, IgM, resulting in high blood viscosity. Other symptoms include anemia (or reduced hemoglobin), fatigue, and bleeding issues. There is currently no cure for WM and only one approved treatment option, ibrutinib.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>About 90% of WM patients present with mutations in the MYD88 gene and 30-40% of patients present with mutations in the CXCR4 receptor gene as well. These patients, referred to as double-mutation patients, have more severe diseases and tend to respond worse than patients with only the MYD88 mutation when receiving ibrutinib.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Interim data from our Phase 1b trial as of April 15, 2021, demonstrated the potential for mavorixafor plus ibrutinib therapy to be a best-in-class treatment in these double-mutation WM patients.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Overall, all patients (100%) experienced reductions in serum IgM and no patients’ disease progressed while on treatment. At 6 months of treatment, patients with double mutations treated with mavorixafor achieved median IgM level reductions of 60%-75%. This compares favorably to published ibrutinib monotherapy reductions of 38%-45% in double-mutation patients. In addition, one patient achieved normal IgM, and two of four patients (50%) had a &gt;50% reduction in serum IgM from baseline.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>All patients with hemoglobin levels below normal at baseline (anemia at baseline) had increased during treatment, with a median change in hemoglobin of &gt;20 g/L, approaching normal levels, which suggests a reduction in cancer burden in the bone marrow. Mavorixafor and ibrutinib exposures were consistent with previous single-agent studies, suggesting no drug-drug interactions and no serious adverse events were reported in the Phase 1b study. Results to date include data from 8 patients, with a median study duration of 156 days.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you think the therapy will have a large impact on patients with WM?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paula Ragan:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Results from our Phase 1b trial to date demonstrated the potential for mavorixafor plus ibrutinib therapy to be a best-in-class treatment option in these double-mutation WM patients, who generally experience a delayed treatment response, inferior depth of response, and/or shorter progression-free survival, with the standard of care.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We look forward to presenting longer-term data and an expanded data set from this trial later in the year. If the safety and clinical efficacy continue to be positive, we believe mavorixafor has the potential to improve the standard of care and provide some hope to this difficult-to-treat WM patient population, including potential deeper reductions in IgM levels and improvements in response rates.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the importance of reduction in IgM levels in Waldenström’s patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paula Ragan:</strong>&nbsp;<em>People with WM, and those with the double mutation, in particular, produce large amounts of a protein called immunoglobulin M (IgM), a type of protein that in normal conditions help the body fight infection. However, large quantities of IgM in blood lead to an increased risk of developing a serious emergent condition called symptomatic hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS), characterized by a thickening of the blood, limiting its healthy flow. Increased IgM levels are associated with many symptoms, including fatigue, unexplained weight loss, enlarged lymph nodes or spleen, weakness, and unexplained bleeding.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As such, reduction of IgM levels in WM patients is one of the most relevant parameters of clinical efficacy, such as an overall response, and improvement in quality of life.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is mavorixafor (X4P-001)? Discuss its MoA and the importance in WM patients.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paula Ragan:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Mavorixafor is a molecule that binds and antagonizes the CXCR4 receptor resulting in reduced signaling. In 30-40% of WM patients, the CXCR4 receptor has a gain-of-function mutation which leads to overactivation of the CXCR4 pathway by its ligand chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12). Over-signaling of the CXCR4 pathway immobilizes the CXCR4-mutated cancer cells in the bone marrow enabling them to grow and produce excessively high levels of IgM. This growth ultimately crowds out the healthy bone marrow cells resulting in anemia and contributing to the other severe symptoms that are the hallmark of WM disease.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By blocking the CXCR4 receptor from being stimulated by its ligand CXCL12, mavorixafor increases mobilization and trafficking of cancerous B cells from the bone marrow. At the patient level, this reduces the crowding effects of cancer on the bone marrow which leads to improved hemoglobin levels (reducing anemia) and decreasing IgM (lowering cancer burden). The results of our Phase 1b study of mavorixafor plus ibrutinib demonstrate this proof of mechanism in our initial 8 patients treated at the low to mid doses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Highlight the pipeline of X4 Pharmaceutical.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paula Ragan:</strong>&nbsp;<em>At X4 Pharmaceuticals, we are advancing a variety of therapies for the treatment of diseases resulting from dysfunction of the CXCR4 pathway. In addition to our Phase 1b trial currently investigating our lead asset, mavorixafor, in combination with ibrutinib for the treatment of WM, we are advancing a Phase 3 trial, 4WHIM, evaluating mavorixafor in people with the immunodeficiency WHIM syndrome.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition, we are evaluating mavorixafor in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and are exploring additional indications for mavorixafor’s use across larger chronic neutropenic populations given its demonstrated effect of increasing total white blood cell levels with both acute and chronic dosing.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We believe that inhibition of the CXCR4 receptor creates the potential for mavorixafor to provide therapeutic benefit across a wide variety of rare diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies and certain types of cancer. We are evaluating additional preclinical candidates to expand our pipeline to address additional rare diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When you are expecting your first approval for mavorixafor?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paula Ragan:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Our most advanced program is the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating mavorixafor in people with WHIM syndrome, a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low white blood cell counts, severe recurrent bacterial infections in multiple organ systems (lung, ears, and skin) and warts (alterations/ulcers in the skin caused by the HPV virus) that can turn into cancer over time. WHIM syndrome patients are born with gain-of-function mutations in CXCR4, leading to over-signaling of the receptor; mavorixafor, administered as an oral once-daily capsule, has the potential to correct the root cause of this debilitating disease.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Data from our Phase 2 trial to date has demonstrated the potential of mavorixafor to become the first disease-modifying therapy for people with WHIM. This includes improving circulating levels of white blood cells and reducing infections rates and wart burden, with a positive safety profile in patients treated for more than 2 years.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>With 23 patients now enrolled, we have surpassed the 18-patient minimum enrollment needed in our Phase 3 trial for primary endpoint analyses and assessment of clinical benefit and enable a U.S. regulatory filing (if supported by the Phase 3 data). We anticipate enrollment will conclude in Q3 of this year and we expect to have top-line data from the trial in Q4 2022. Mavorixafor has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast Track Designation, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in the U.S., in addition to Orphan Drug Status in the U.S. and EU. We hope to make mavorixafor available to WHIM patients as soon as possible</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What motivates the company to work on rare diseases such as WM?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paula Ragan:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Thousands of genetic rare diseases affect small patient populations who lack treatment alternatives and have little to no prospects of future options due to the small patient populations affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>X4 was founded to make a difference and provide hope for this and other rare populations by hearing the patients’ voices and advancing disease-modifying treatments that target the cause of disease, with the potential to improve their quality of life and, and in some cases, offer a dramatic change for the better, for the very first time. Every patient deserves to feel hope.&nbsp;</em></p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the approval of the Navitor latest-generation TAVI System in detail.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>We recently (May 2021) announced CE Mark approval for our Navitor™ transcatheter aortic valve implantation system (TAVI/TAVR), which is our latest-generation advancement to our TAVI offering outside of the U.S. CE Mark designation allows us to make Navitor available throughout the EU and offers a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme surgical risk. Aortic stenosis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the aortic valve stiffens secondary to disease, impeding the pumping of oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What does this approval mean to the countries accepting CE Mark approval?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>As our world population ages and aortic stenosis cases continue to increase, Navitor’s innovative technology is all the more critical and its entry into the European market is timely for the patients who need access to this type of therapy. The CE Mark announcement means that the minimally invasive Navitor TAVI system is now available to physicians and patients in these countries for the treatment of </em><em>the life-threatening aortic stenosis heart condition.</em><em> Navitor also pairs with our leading FlexNav delivery system which enables better placement accuracy and improved patient outcomes during the TAVI procedure.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does this technology treating aortic stenosis prove to be remarkable?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael:</strong> <em>Open-heart surgery can be a high-risk procedure for some people with severe aortic stenosis because of potential complications related to age, frailty, or having multiple other diseases or conditions. The Navitor TAVI procedure is a less invasive alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement that helps patients with this debilitating condition get back to living their best lives through better health.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>With Navitor, Abbott is advancing TAVI therapies with advancements including a unique design to prevent blood leakage around the valve. It also offers best-in-class deliverability and access</em> through small vessels, expanding treatment options for patients with severe aortic stenosis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the major differences and impacts this new generation transcatheter will have on people and how is it different from its previous generations?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>The objective of a transcatheter aortic valve procedure is to restore normal aortic valve hemodynamics, or blood flow, at the lowest possible risk. Physicians sometimes encounter challenges and complications when using current TAVI systems to treat patients with complex anatomies. Abbott sought to develop solutions to address the most critical of these issues: large frame cells to preserve future access to the coronary arteries and optimal hemodynamics, or blood flow, through the replacement valve during the procedure. Navitor is </em><em>implanted with Abbott's&nbsp;FlexNav&nbsp;Delivery System, which&nbsp;received&nbsp;CE Mark&nbsp;in 2020 and offers the smallest TAVI delivery system with a slim profile to allow accurate valve placement for different aortic anatomies – even for people with unusually small vessels</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How will this CE approval help Abbott to go further in the advancement of TAVI procedures and help treat people who have life-threatening heart conditions?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>We are constantly working on new options and improvements to our life-changing technologies. The addition of Navitor strengthens&nbsp;Abbott's&nbsp;portfolio of structural heart&nbsp;transcatheter offerings&nbsp;that&nbsp;provide less invasive&nbsp;alternatives&nbsp;to&nbsp;treat&nbsp;debilitating heart diseases with previously few treatment options.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the features of this new TAVI system.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael:</strong> <em>Navitor's innovative features include a unique fabric cuff, NaviSeal, that reduces or eliminates the risk of blood leakage around the valve implant, a common complication following TAVI procedures. It's the only self-expanding&nbsp;TAVI system with intra-annular (within&nbsp;the&nbsp;native valve) leaflets&nbsp;and large frame cells, which help improve access to critical coronary arteries to facilitate future interventions to treat coronary artery disease (CAD). The device's design additionally provides improved hemodynamics or better blood flow.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are Abbott’s other efforts for improving the lives of patients with life-threatening heart conditions?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael:</strong> As the world’s population proportionately ages, there's an increasing need to treat structural heart conditions, which are mostly related to degenerative disease and the aging process, but also include congenital heart defects secondary to incomplete development of the child’s heart in utero. Following advancements and improvements in real-time imaging technologies, minimally invasive treatment solutions – which are often simpler and safer – have grown to become one of the fastest-growing technology segments in cardiac care. Abbott has the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions for the treatment of structural heart diseases including devices and tools for the repair or replacement of diseased or damaged heart valves, and occlusion devices for closing heart defects in children and areas of blood clots formation that can lead to stroke in adults.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Notable within our structural heart portfolio, we offer minimally invasive therapies like our leading MitraClip device that is the world’s first transcatheter mitral valve repair therapy. To date, MitraClip has helped treat more than 150,000 patients worldwide suffering from mitral regurgitation, or a leaky mitral valve. For patients whose mitral valves cannot be repaired, we have developed the Tendyne transcatheter mitral valve replacement system, which has been approved in the EU since early 2020. Recently, we have expanded clip therapy technology for the treatment of tricuspid valve regurgitation, which is the most undertreated valve disease, with our TriClip device, also been approved in Europe since 2020.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We’re also focused on making devices for our smallest, most vulnerable patients to address heart defects in high-risk babies and children, as seen through our Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder and Masters HP 15mm Mechanical Heart Valve. Our growing stroke mitigation portfolio includes the Amplatzer Amulet device (approved outside the U.S. currently) for closing the left atrial appendage and our Amplatzer PFO Occluder device for treating cryptogenic stroke. We are the leaders in the treatment of life’s most challenging structural heart diseases.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Beyond structural heart, no company in the world today expands the boundaries of cardiovascular innovation like Abbott or offers such comprehensive solutions across the patient’s healthcare journey.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Diseases of the heart are complex, and success depends on innovation that brings to reality treatment options once thought impossible. Abbott covers the continuum of cardiovascular care –from diagnosis to treatment to management – pioneering comprehensive solutions to tackle the cardiovascular disease from every angle.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We’re building a true care continuum for patients, significantly improving the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What motivates the company to work on transcatheter? How can you say that it will transform people’s lives?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael:</strong> <em>At Abbott, we help people live better lives through better health. And we do this across all our businesses – diagnostic, nutrition, established pharmaceuticals, and our medical device businesses. In Abbott’s structural heart business, our purpose is to restore health and improve quality of life by developing devices and services for the treatment of structural heart disease. The measure of success in our work is whether our devices provide greater benefit versus risk as compared to existing standards of care.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Navitor is a great example of this because it represents the culmination of years of work to bring a better benefit-to-risk profile to patients needing a TAVI procedure as compared to existing choices. Navitor’s ease-of-use, deliverability, safety,</em> and outstanding hemodynamic performance make it a better solution for many situations. As with any of our products to treat structural heart disease, we measure our success based on the benefit-to-risk profile for our minimally invasive, transcatheter therapies as compared to the existing standards of care including surgical procedures. This is an important metric and performance threshold we use to guide and ensure that the output of our engineering, business development,<em> and clinical research efforts results in outcomes that advance the standard of care.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We see a big future focused on the treatment of cardiovascular conditions and we are excited to be at the forefront with the most comprehensive portfolio of minimally invasive structural heart offerings in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When can we expect the approval of the Navitor Transcatheter Aortic Valve in the US and other geographies?</strong></p>

65442,PharmaShots Interview: Abbott's Suela Sulo Shares Insights on the Model of Care Addressing Malnutrition Across the Continuum of Care,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with<strong> PharmaShots, Suela Sulo, Ph.D., M.S., Director of Global Health Economics, Outcomes Research and Policy</strong> at Abbott shared her views on how this study will shift the way to approach nutrition across the continuum of care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>A study published in the Journal of Primary Care and Community Health has shown that a new simple model of care where HCPs screen for malnutrition risk, quickly institute a nutrition care plan that includes an appropriate oral nutritional supplement, and educate on the importance of continuing healthy nutrition habits at home over 90-days can help improve care, reduce health resource use, and lower healthcare costs</li><li>This model can also be successfully recreated in a range of settings, from hospitals and outpatient clinics, to skilled nursing facilities and home healthcare</li><li>The MST is a validated tool that helps to screen, identify and treat people who are at risk for malnutrition</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Share the details of this model of care with our readers. How it can shift the way to approach nutrition across the continuum of care?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suela Sulo: </strong><em>The Quality Improvement Program (QIP) is a comprehensive and multi-dimensional model with three key steps:</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong><em>Screen Patients to Determine Malnutrition Risk:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Screen and assess patients for undernutrition or overnutrition risk with a few simple questions.</em><em></em></li><li><strong><em>Communicate a Personalized Nutrition Care Plan:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Create a customized plan and recommend an appropriate nutritional drink such as Ensure or Glucerna to help patients get the nutrients they need.</em><em></em></li><li><strong><em>Deliver Nutrition Education:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Educate patients and their caregivers on the importance of nutrition and nutritional drinks compliance.</em><em></em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Nutrition tends to be healthcare’s blind spot. QIPs highlight the importance of recognizing and treating malnutrition as a vital sign; blood pressure monitoring, for example. It takes only a few minutes to recognize if someone is at nutritional risk and within minutes nutrition care plans can be created to ensure at-risk or malnourished individuals receive the appropriate care they need to feel better, heal or recover.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>QIP models of nutrition care can highlight the importance of nutrition as a critical component to overall health in order for nutrition to be a priority for healthcare providers across different settings of care (i.e., hospital, at-home, outpatient).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the key points of the study published in the Journal of Primary Care and Community Health supporting the use of a new health care model.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suela Sulo: </strong><em>This new research with Abbott and the University of Southern California proves that, when implemented systematically, this simple but comprehensive nutrition model can promote better overall health, strengthen the quality of care, and reduce healthcare resource use. Taken together, these are all factors that can ultimately reduce healthcare costs, for providers and patients alike.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The study found that implementing a nutrition program helped improve care, reduced healthcare resource use, and lowered healthcare costs. The three clinics that participated in the study and implemented a nutrition program observed:</em></p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>11.6% decrease in the percentage of patients using healthcare resources over 90 days, allowing healthcare providers to better manage their patients while reducing costs</em></li><li><em>Improvement in the quality of care, with 81.8% of patients reporting high levels of satisfaction with their nutrition care</em></li><li><em>Net savings of $495 per patient</em></li></ul>

<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the role of real-world quality improvement programs (QIPs) in enlightening health care services.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suela Sulo: </strong><em>Nutrition care programs, like the one implemented in this study, demonstrate the power of nutrition. Prioritizing nutrition across different settings of care, including outpatient clinics, can help healthcare providers give their patients the best chance of fast recovery that can allow them to return to living a healthy life.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Processes, like the one implemented in this study for optimizing nutrition, are sustainable, scalable, and able to be replicated. And, they are able to be applied in any health care system or outpatient clinic, whether in a rural community or a large city, they are adaptable and able to produce positive outcomes, improving patient health and reducing costs.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: What is the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suela Sulo: </strong><em>Malnutrition may be invisible to the eye and often goes undiagnosed. Many do not realize that this underlying condition can occur in individuals who are underweight or overweight, and assessing malnutrition or its risk prior to surgery or treatment is important because it can impact a patient’s health outcomes.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST), a validated tool, helps to screen, identify and treat people who are at risk for malnutrition. Using the Malnutrition Screening Tool takes less than 5 minutes to complete, using two simple questions looking to address:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>unintentional weight loss, and;</em><em></em></li><li><em>poor appetite</em><em></em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you think nutrition plays a vital role in improving the quality of care?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suela Sulo: </strong><em>Prioritizing nutrition can be foundational to improving the overall quality of care, which in turn may improve health outcomes, enhance the quality of life and decrease the economic burden on individuals and our healthcare system. Research shows that when medical teams implement nutrition screenings, intervene with appropriate nutritional drinks and follow patients' nutritional status in the hospital, they help give patients the best possible chance of a successful recovery.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As providers and administrators face added pressures from rising healthcare costs, value-based nutrition interventions should be considered in acute and post-acute care institutions and health systems across the U.S. and around the world.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>With this research, healthcare authorities have an opportunity to implement effective practices, policies, and comprehensive malnutrition strategies across the continuum of care – at hospitals, post-acute or primary care settings, and at home, making our communities healthier for all.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the study design in which the company implements the QIP.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suela Sulo: </strong><em>QIP was informed as a real-world study to replicate current practice and to simulate the </em>real-world patient experience. The goal is for QIPs to be sustainable, scalable, and reproducible – any health system or outpatient clinic, whether in a rural community or a large city, can adopt<em> them and see positive outcomes – improve patient health and reduce costs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Highlight the results of the study in a non-scientific manner.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suela Sulo: </strong><em>The study found that implementing screenings for nutrition helped healthcare professionals better care for patients in outpatient settings who were at risk</em> <em>for malnutrition. Implementing this simple step and providing patients with the nutrition and education they needed showed that patients were able to stay healthy, allowing them to recover while staying at home rather than needing to receive, and sometimes pay for, costly care in a hospital, emergency room or outpatient clinic. Moreover, the study showed that healthcare costs, which are burdensome to patients and providers, were reduced and patient satisfaction increased</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you think implementing a QIP program leads to cost-saving? If yes, provide some static to justify your answers.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suela Sulo: </strong><em>Addressing nutrition needs before delivering care allows health care providers to have a better picture of the patient, which allows them to deliver better solutions tailored to the patient's needs—and the data supports it. QIPs conducted in hospitals, post-acute or primary care settings, and at home, have demonstrated cost savings ranging between approximately $500-$4000 per patient as a result of reduced healthcare resource use, primarily hospitalizations. This is consistent with other published research including a recent publication by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) showing that nutrition support therapy results in annual cost savings of $580 million on high-priority therapeutic conditions such as cancer and surgery. (Reference: Tyler R, et al. JPEN. 2020. 1–12. doi: 10.1002/jpen.1768).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the clinical implications of the QIP program?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suela Sulo: </strong><em>Study findings suggest that attention to nutrition care can improve patient health status and focus on minimizing the utilization of healthcare resources costs. Overall, we’ve seen that stakeholders across the continuum of care benefit when people are properly nourished: health systems are able to deliver quality care with reduced costs, healthcare providers are able to provide higher quality care with improved patient outcomes, and patients can feel better about the holistic regimen of care they are receiving to actively treat symptoms and successfully manage conditions.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: What are Abbott’s plans to redefine healthcare in this area?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suela Sulo: </strong><em>Abbott partners with leading health economists, researchers, and healthcare systems, such as the University of Southern California, to conduct numerous studies that evaluate the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of nutritional therapies across different healthcare settings, with a goal to identify solutions that lead to a better-nourished world.&nbsp; By studying the role of nutrition in aging and disease management, Abbott is helping adults live more active, healthier and longer lives</em></p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the key features of the ixlayer platform?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Rich:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;ixlayer is a leader in technology-based solutions for diagnostic testing focusing on transforming the telehealth industry with innovative laboratory testing platforms for all areas of the health ecosystem. The platform provides healthcare providers, payors, and governments with the infrastructure to scale products and solutions that deliver patient care from the comfort of their homes. A few features that make ixlayer a patient-centric and distinguished platform are that 1) the physician and patient can use the platform to order a patient a test, 2) the platform will coordinate a sample collection process at a facility or ship an at-home collection kit to the patient overnight with instructions, 3) the platform can triage the testing to any lab that has validated the test so patients have access to multiple labs, getting their results as fast as possible, and 4) results are delivered in a real-time patient-friendly and easy to understand reports in a HIPAA compliant patient, clinical, and organization portal. -Poorya Sabounchi, COO of ixlayer</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How did this technology help during the global pandemic, COVID-19?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Rich:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;ixlayer’s COVID-19 diagnostic testing platform currently supports over 1.5 million patients, has launched over 1,100 testing programs since 2020 alone, and over 3 million lab tests have been performed in the last year. The testing program has been developed to expand access to COVID-19 risk screening and active disease testing. In March of 2020, ixlayer launched its COVID-19 Clinical Testing platform for labs and health systems that allows for COVID-19 specific content and user flows to give physicians/health systems, organizations, and university groups the ability to quickly connect with labs to deliver COVID-19 testing. The ixlayer COVID-19 Clinical Test platform gathers real-time data, including demographics on positive and negative tests by age, gender, and geographic location - quickly identifying trends and hotspots in disease transmission. The technology streamlined the collaboration between the CDC, state health departments, and healthcare professionals to be patient and clinician-facing.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In 2020 and 2021, ixlayer launched health testing programs for Fortune 1000 Companies and sector leaders such as Illumina, Eurofins, PPD, Hims&amp;Hers, and CIC Health, and the platform has been used by major institutions such as Stanford University, the U.S. Coast Guard, and Mass General Hospital to help with COVID-19 testing. -Poorya Sabounchi, COO of ixlayer</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is ixlayer's diagnostic testing applicable beyond COVID? If yes, what are those, and is there some analysis, data available for our reader?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Rich:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Part of ixlayer's mission is striving to bring the ease of online deployment that’s a hallmark of eCommerce providers, along with the “anyone can play” versatility of payments platforms like Stripe - aka they are essential “Shopify the testing experience,” to include not only COVID-19 tests but any other lab-based diagnostic tests including those for diabetes, STDs, etc.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>ixlayer is agnostic to the lab or how the test is performed (for example at-home, drive-through at the clinic), allowing testing programs to be deployed across large populations within weeks. As many have learned this past year, billions of lab tests are ordered every year, and they are deployed to hundreds of thousands of labs through a highly fragmented system incapable of quickly scaling up. Backed by top-notch forward-thinking investors such as Accenture, ixlayer is becoming the platform that connects all the key stakeholders -- from patients, healthcare professionals, and labs -- to transform the diagnostics industry. -Poorya Sabounchi, COO of ixlayer</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss more about Accenture Ventures’ work?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Rich:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Accenture Ventures is a corporate venture capital group dedicated to finding, investing, and partnering with early-stage tech startups and entrepreneurs who can help fill strategic gaps for the Global 2000.

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> <em>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is cancer that develops in the colon or the rectum, which are part of the body’s digestive or gastrointestinal system. Globally, CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) occurs when the proteins that repair mismatch errors in DNA replication are missing or non-functional, leading to microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. Approximately 5% of metastatic CRC patients have dMMR or MSI-H tumors. Patients with these biomarkers are less likely to benefit from conventional chemotherapy and typically have a poor prognosis.</em></p>

<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Dr. Pierre Pellier, CEO of CTMA</strong>, share his views on <strong>CT-SCOUT</strong> that helps to boost patient recruitment in the clinical trials for <strong>IBD</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><li>CTMA developed the web mobile platform, CT-Scout to boost patient recruitment in the clinical trials by facilitating a quick and simple&nbsp;study detection for eligible patients</li><li>CT-Scout is currently available in one therapy area i.e., IBD specifically for CD &amp; UC. The benefits of using CT-Scout have been demonstrated in several settings</li><li>CT-Scout showed an increase in productivity&nbsp;and included patients number.

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the efforts of CTMA in changing the way of detecting patients for IBD clinical trials.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Pellier</strong>:&nbsp;<em>In 2014, CTMA developed a tool, CT-Scout, to promote the live matching of studies currently running at an investigational site with patients’ characteristics, hence enhancing real-time detection of clinical trials for potentially eligible patients. The application was conceived by investigators, for the benefit of investigators. The app, which is accessible from any computer or smart device, is meant to be primarily used during a normal patient-health care professional (HCP) interaction and will allow the HCP to know within a minute if one or several studies running at his/her site may be compatible with the patient’s characteristics.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the working principle of CT-SCOUT &amp; how it will help in recruiting patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Pellier:</strong>&nbsp;<em>CT-Scout works on the premises that poor recruitment is not due to the fact that suitable patients for clinical trials are not being seen at sites, but rather that patients are there, but not offered, during the relevant short time window, the opportunity to participate in clinical trials because the HCP’s do not have the time and/or capability to quickly and efficiently match the patients’ characteristics with the basket of studies running at their investigational sites. By facilitating a quick and simple study detection, CT-Scout effectively drives more potentially eligible patients towards clinical trials. This principle is based on the inventor’s personal experience, confirmed by research indicated that only 0.2% of patients seen in the clinic make it to a clinical trial.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the benefits of using CT-SCOUT? What is the significance of its new version?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Pellier:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Benefits will be different, depending on the lenses. For the investigational site, beyond having a facilitating tool, the benefit is the potential to enlists all HCP’s at the site (and some referral doctors if applicable) into the recruitment effort, as they do not need to recall all major criteria for all studies running at the site. For the patients, the benefit is to increase his/her chances to be offered the possibility to join a clinical trial; for many patients with chronic diseases, clinical trials represent a true therapeutic alternative. At last, but not least, for the sponsor of the study, the benefit is to make the study highly visible to the site if a patient’s characteristics match and before a therapeutic decision is made so that more potential patients are considered for its study.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The new version, launched during fall 2020, offers an even faster detection capability, an upgraded security system, a powerful patient management tool, and an enhanced, more user-friendly interface</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Please support the use of CT-SCOUT with clinical evidence.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Pellier:</strong> <em>CT-Scout is currently available in one therapy area: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Within IBD clinical trials, the benefits of using CT-Scout have been demonstrated in several settings. In one published evidence, where CT-Scout was made available to some sites participating in a global clinical trial program run by a major pharma sponsor, the use of CT-Scout resulted in sites finally recruiting two (Crohn’s Disease) to four (Ulcerative Colitis) times more patients than sites not using the tool. Benefits going in the same direction have been observed in other programs, yet cannot be disclosed for confidentiality reasons.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you put some light on the list of global companies that are currently collaborating with CTMA?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Pellier:</strong>&nbsp;<em>So far, CTMA has been/is collaborating with the majority of pharma companies running global clinical programs in the field of IBD. For confidentiality reasons, we cannot disclose their names.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How it increases the competitive advantages &amp; site performance &amp; visibility?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Pellier:</strong>&nbsp;<em>See above. As shown above, sites using CT-Scout have shown a significant increase in productivity and included patients numbers, compared to sites non-users. For clinical trial operators, this represents a very important feature that is likely to result in increased visibility of these sites.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the plans of the company to operate CT-SCOUT in other therapeutic areas?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Pellier:</strong>&nbsp;<em>As indicated above, CT-Scout is only available for now in one therapy area (TA), IBD. However, and considering that the CT-Scout benefits are also of interest across all therapy areas without much exception, CTMA is working on expanding its offer to other TA’s. Priorities for development are given to TA’s which are closely related to IBD, such as other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in dermatology and rheumatology, plus oncology.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you looking for more global companies to collaborate for CT-SCOUT? If yes, how can one contact you for collaboration?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Pellier:</strong>&nbsp;<em>As we are expanding our offer to other TA’s, we are expecting to progressively be in a position to collaborate with more global companies involved in the field of clinical research. We can be contacted at:&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""mailto:info@ctma.fr"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>info@ctma.fr</em></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Will it bring a revolution to the clinical trial space?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Pellier:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Shortening the duration of the recruitment phase of clinical trials by two to fourfold would probably get us close to leading a revolution indeed. But to be a realist and pragmatic, many clinical trial sponsors would already be largely satisfied with a reduction of their recruitment campaign that can be measured in a week and/or months. This CTMA can offer just a small fraction of all investigators in a study using our application.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you please provide a highlight of the data presented at FOCIS 2021?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Anish Suri:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Cue Biopharma’s strategic focus in autoimmunity and inflammation has centered on two key approaches: (i) for diseases with known or restricted autoantigens we have deployed Immuno-STATs to target antigen-specific pathogenic T cells, and (ii) a pathway-specific approach that focuses on regulatory T cells and pathways that re-set immune balance. To the latter point, Cue Biopharma presented preclinical data on its first drug product candidate from the CUE-400 series, CUE-401, that is designed for selective differentiation and expansion of induced regulatory T cells (iTregs) in a patient’s body (CD4+FOXP3+ iTregs). CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs are a critical subset of immune cells involved in the control of immune tolerance by regulating immune homeostasis and limiting self-reactive immune responses.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>CUE-401 incorporates rationally engineered cytokines (variants of IL-2 and TGF-ß) that have been known to induce differentiation of naïve T cells to iTregs. Induction of Tregs in vivo is an innovative and potentially effective means of suppressing autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Key data highlights from the FOCIS presentation include: </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>CUE-401-induced Tregs are phenotypically comparable to iTregs generated with soluble forms of TGF-beta and IL-2 found in nature. </em></li><li><em>In vitro, CUE-401 can effectively induce and expand FOXP3-expressing Tregs from T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors as well as donors with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). </em></li><li><em>CUE-401-induced Tregs additionally demonstrated the ability to functionally suppress the response of effector T cells, hence supporting mechanistic activity.</em></li><li><em>Studies in in vivo models also demonstrated that a single dose of CUE-401 was effective at inducing and expanding Tregs in mice with active and ongoing autoimmune gastritis. Specifically, seven days following a single dose of CUE-401, an increased percentage of FOXP3+ CD4+ T cells was found in the blood and gastric draining lymph nodes. The increase in Tregs was also accompanied by suppression of autoreactive T cell proliferation.</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is CUE-401? How can it induce and expand regulatory T cells in vivo?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Anish Suri:</strong>&nbsp;<em>CUE-401 is a novel bispecific molecule engineered to deliver two key immunomodulatory cytokine signals to induce and expand regulatory T cells (Tregs): 1) transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ß) and 2) interleukin 2 (IL-2). The cytokine signals used in CUE-401 are variants from the versions found in nature with the IL-2 signal modified to have different affinity for IL-2 receptor subunits and TGF-ß modified to reduce TGF-ß receptor binding. (Figure 1)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Delivery of wild-type TGF-ß and IL-2 found in nature has its challenges given that it does not ensure that both signals will engage the same target T cells. In addition, ex vivo delivery can lead to systemic effects and safety liabilities. To this end, CUE-401 provides an elegant solution that can deliver the two key cytokine signals to the same target T cell, and potentially circumvent the safety liabilities.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What indications does Cue Biopharma plan to assess CUE-401 on and why?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Anish Suri:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Cue-401 has the potential to be deployed for many chronic autoimmune diseases like lupus, IBD (inflammatory bowel diseases), RA (rheumatoid arthritis), and for patients suffering graft versus host disease (GVHD) and even transplant rejection. Cue Biopharma continues its ongoing characterization of CUE-401 in preclinical disease models to identify priority indications.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: In addition to CUE-401, CUE Biopharma is advancing a pipeline of therapeutics leveraging its Immuno-STAT&nbsp;<em>(Selective Targeting and Alteration of T cells)</em>&nbsp;platform. Can you explain how the platform works?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Anish Suri:</strong>&nbsp;<em>The Immuno-STAT™ (Selective Targeting and Alteration of T cells</em><strong><em>)</em></strong><em>&nbsp;platform creates stable, off-the-shelf molecules referred to as Immuno-STATs, designed to selectively engage and modulate disease-relevant T cells within the patient’s body without the need for ex vivo manipulation. The key benefit is the ability to provide targeted therapies for both cancers and autoimmune diseases with the potential for higher efficacy while avoiding the negative side effects of global systemic approaches.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Immuno-STATS are reverse engineered to mimic the natural mechanism that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) use to engage T cells during an immune response. This is done through the simultaneous presentation of two different signals or “cues” that lead to selective T cell activation against the disease target of choice:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Signal #1 enables specificity and selectivity of T cells. It consists of the target disease antigenic peptide presented by stabilized MHC molecules (also known as HLA molecules in humans). The peptide-HLA complex engages only the disease-relevant T cells via their T cell receptor (TCR).&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Signal #2 consists of a key immune-regulatory signal to enable selective activation or inhibition of disease-specific T cells for the treatment of cancer or autoimmune disease, respectively.</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How do Immuno-STAT biologics selectively modulate disease-associated T cells to fight cancer?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Anish Suri:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Immuno-STAT cancer-specific molecules leverage a modified immune-activating molecule, interleukin 2 (IL-2), that has been uniquely engineered to achieve preferential selective activation of the cancer-killing T cells (CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells). Signal #1 varies for each specific drug product program, as it provides specificity for each tumor type.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>For instance, CUE-101, Cue Biopharma’s lead drug product candidate in development for the treatment of patients with human papillomavirus-positive recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HPV+ R/M HNSCC) includes the HPV E7 protein, as its Signal #1. This enables specificity against HPV+ tumors.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>CUE 101 has already demonstrated clinical potential in Phase 1 clinical trial as monotherapy in late-stage cancer patients, including a confirmed partial response with an approximate 50% tumor reduction and six stable disease responses, as of June of 2021– a rarity for the immuno-oncology space in which very few immunotherapies show single-agent clinical benefit.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What next steps should we expect from Cue Biopharma in terms of clinical programs, collaborations, and other aspects?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Anish Suri:</strong>&nbsp;<em>In terms of CUE-401, we continue an ongoing characterization of the biologic in preclinical disease models to identify priority indications. Our research program with Merck to develop clinical Immuno-STAT candidates from our CUE-300 series for selected autoimmune diseases has provided favorable pre-clinical results, with our lead candidate, CUE-301.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We continue to make progress in our immuno-oncology programs with our CUE-101 Phase 1a/b monotherapy dose-escalation and expansion trials in patients with HPV+ second line and beyond (2L+) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, CUE-101 is being evaluated in Phase 1 dose-escalation trial as first-line treatment in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in the same patient population. In parallel, we continue our work to further develop and optimize our platform technologies and our pipeline, including CUE-102, our next clinical candidate, targeting the Wilms’ tumor 1 (WT1) antigen for cancer treatment. CUE-102 is on track for IND filing in 2022. Beyond that, we have very exciting data demonstrating the activity of Immuno-STATs with mutated KRAS epitopes that can be harnessed for cancers with specific KRAS driver mutations. We continue to move these novel molecules forward with much enthusiasm.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you open to additional collaborations to advance the development and delivery of your Immuno-STAT Biologics?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Anish Suri:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We are open to exploring strategic partnerships and collaborations selectively with potential partners that have the depth of scientific understanding and complementary capabilities that allow us to rapidly move our assets into the clinic and help maximize the fullest potential of our platform. The modularity and flexibility of our technology allow us to generate vast numbers of therapeutic molecules in a relatively short period, hence enabling partnerships that expedite execution of our R&amp;D strategy is of the highest importance to our objectives.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the key takeaways of the data of LIBTAYO presented at the ESMO virtual plenary?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Krishnansu S. Tewari:</strong> <em>At the ESMO Virtual Plenary, results were presented from the Phase 3 trial evaluating Libtayo (cemiplimab) in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who had previously progressed on chemotherapy. This is the first Phase 3 trial of immunotherapy in advanced cervical cancer and also the largest randomized trial conducted in this population to date. It’s also notable that patients were enrolled regardless of their PD-L1 status.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In many ways, I would characterize this as a landmark trial – especially when you consider that patients at this stage of cervical cancer often face a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. With this trial, Libtayo became the first immunotherapy to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR) in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, compared to chemotherapy. These gains were not accompanied by a deterioration in the quality of life and are observed in both the overall study population and the squamous cell carcinoma subpopulation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>These results led the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to stop the trial early, and I believe the results support the use of Libtayo as a potential new second-line treatment for women with advanced cervical cancer.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss outcomes that are favoring LIBTAYO over chemotherapy.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr.&nbsp;Krishnansu S. Tewari:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Treatment outcomes were assessed in the overall population, and by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma subtypes. Notably, Libtayo demonstrated positive results in all three groups for overall survival.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Among the overall population, patients treated with Libtayo experienced significant improvements in OS, PFS, and ORR, compared to chemotherapy. Specifically, Libtayo reduced the risk of death by 31% and reduced the risk of disease progression by 25%. Additionally, Libtayo-treatments experienced a 16% ORR compared to 6% for chemotherapy, per Kaplan-Meier estimates.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>&nbsp;The results were similarly significant in the SCC subgroup, which made up 78% of patients in the trial. Here, Libtayo reduced the risk of death by 27% and the risk of disease progression by 29%. ORR was 18% for Libtayo, compared to 7% for chemotherapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>While assessment of the adenocarcinoma subgroup was not a pre-specified endpoint, a posthoc analysis demonstrated that Libtayo reduced the risk of death by 44% and reduced the risk of disease progression by 9%. In this subgroup, ORR was 12% for Libtayo, compared to 5% for chemotherapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>When it came to patient-reported outcomes Libtayo-treated patients were able to generally improve or maintain their baseline Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QOL) over time, while those treated with chemotherapy experienced a deterioration that became clinically meaningful starting at cycle 8, per the EORTC QLQ-C30.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>No new Libtayo safety signals were observed. Furthermore, rates of adverse events (AEs) were generally lower among patients treated with Libtayo compared to chemotherapy, despite a longer duration of treatment exposure with Libtayo. AEs of any grade were observed in 88% of Libtayo patients and 91% of chemotherapy patients, and Grade 3 or higher AEs occurred in 45% of Libtayo patients and 53% of chemotherapy patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When can we expect the approval of LIBTAYO in cervical cancer?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Israel Lowy</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We are currently preparing regulatory submissions and hope to bring Libtayo to patients with advanced cervical cancer as soon as possible. However, we are unable to provide additional details at this time.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What would be the targeted geographies for seeking approval?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Israel Lowy</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We are currently preparing regulatory submissions and hope to bring Libtayo to patients with advanced cervical cancer as soon as possible. However, we are unable to provide additional details at this time.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How much change will it bring economically to the market? How much will the company profit?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Israel Lowy:</strong> <em>We generally do not comment on the market potential of any of our approved products. We believe that Libtayo may help address a significant unmet need among this patient population.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss Cervical Cancer and its epidemiology</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Krishnansu S. Tewari:</strong> <em>Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide and is most frequently diagnosed in women between the ages of 35 and 44. Almost all cases are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and approximately 75% are classified as SCC. The remainder is largely adenocarcinomas. Cervical cancer is often curable when detected early and effectively managed, but treatment options are more limited in advanced stages.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>It is estimated that approximately 570,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide each year, with deaths exceeding 250,000. In the U.S. there are 14,500 new patients diagnosed annually and approximately 4,000 women die each year.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How LIBTAYO will be proven a boom in the treatment of cancer in women?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr.&nbsp;Krishnansu S. Tewari:</strong>&nbsp;<em>If approved, I believe Libtayo has the potential to change the way we treat these patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who have progressed on chemotherapy. More importantly, this opens up the possibility of bringing anti-PD-1 therapy using Libtayo earlier in the disease course through a well-designed clinical trial.</em></p>

<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Dr. Philip Mease, MD, Seattle Rheumatology Associates </strong>shares insights on the P-III DISCOVER-1 &amp; 2 Studies of <strong>Tremfya (guselkumab)</strong> for the treatment of <strong>psoriatic arthritis</strong> in The Lancet Rheumatology</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The P-III trials consist of two studies i.e., DISCOVER-1 &amp; 2 evaluates Tremfya in 1100 patients with PsA who have axial symptoms</li><li>The results demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin disease.

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you provide a detailed description of the new data on Janssen’s Tremfya published in The Lancet Rheumatology?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mease</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This data was derived from a subset of patients in the Phase 3 trials of TREMFYA in psoriatic arthritis, known as DISCOVER-1 and -2. Over 1100 patients were involved in those two studies. And this sub-study was interested in determining the impact of TREMFYA on symptoms of spine inflammation and pain in patients with psoriatic arthritis, who happen to have the axial component of psoriatic arthritis. We know that approximately 40 to 50% of patients with psoriatic arthritis, depending upon the cohort, will manifest evidence of spine disease that's caused by immunologic inflammation in the spine, which can be progressive and quite disabling. This sub-study was focused on gaining insight as to whether TREMFYA could improve those symptoms.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What was shown was that patients with x-ray or MRI imaging-confirmed sacroiliac inflammation had significant improvements in validated measures of axial diseases, such as the BASDAI and the ASDAS outcome measures, including specific aspects of the BASDAI such as the spine pain question, and also high thresholds ASDAS responses such as major clinical improvement and inactive disease.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This data provides support for the use of TREMFYA in patients with psoriatic arthritis who have axial symptoms. This sub-study also provides support for proceeding with a further, and more specific study dedicated to axial PsA, in which formal MRI assessment of sacroiliac joints and spine will be conducted throughout the study to document objective changes in the signs of inflammation in the spine in addition to improvement of clinical symptoms.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the impact of this data on PsA patients?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mease:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Because psoriatic arthritis is a heterogeneous disease with multiple clinical domains including arthritis, enthesitis, spine disease, and skin disease, it is valuable to demonstrate improvements in each clinical domain so that patients may have confidence that treatment with TREMFYA will globally improve their disease manifestations.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the benefits of Tremfya for PsA patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mease</strong>:&nbsp;<em>REMFYA has been demonstrated to improve each of the clinical domains of psoriatic arthritis rapidly and with sustained benefit, allowing patients to achieve target goals of disease remission or low disease activity with consequent significant benefits for function and quality of life.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the clinical data supporting the efficacy of Tremfya in PsA patients.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mease:</strong>&nbsp;<em>In Phase 3 clinical trials of TREMFYA in PsA, DISCOVER-1, and -2, significant efficacy was shown in the treatment of arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin disease, improvement of function and quality of life, and improvement of fatigue, all of which significantly impact patients. The data from this sub-study further provides evidence for improvement of the symptoms of spine disease in patients with axial PsA.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is Guselkumab? How will it change the QoL of patients with PsA with sacroiliitis?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mease:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Guselkumab (TREMFYA) is a p19 interleukin (IL-)23 inhibitor, which binds to and inhibits an important pro-inflammatory cytokine that is part of the pathogenesis of conditions such as psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In trials such as the DISCOVER-1 and -2 trials, it has been demonstrated that disease improvements lead to significant and measurable improvements in quality of life. We know that manifestations of spine disease such as sacroiliitis are an important part of the disease, and therefore a part of the global improvement that leads to the betterment of the quality of life.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does Tremfya plan to compete with other products in PsA space, such as Cosentyx and Adalimumab among others?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Mease:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Patients with psoriatic arthritis may not adequately respond to the various treatments that have been approved, such as the IL-17 inhibitors or the TNF inhibitors, or the patient may have a good effect but then lose effect over time. Or they may have issues with safety or tolerability. Thus, it is important to have multiple medications and mechanisms of action to effectively treat all patients with PsA over time. Further, it is valuable to have medications such as TREMFYA, with an excellent safety profile as well as efficacy profile, for patients to choose.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the data from the Phase 1b trial supporting the efficacy of DUR-928 in patients with NASH.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:</strong><em> </em><em>This Phase 1b randomized, open-label multi-center U.S. clinical trial assessed DUR-928 safety and early signs of efficacy in NASH patients with stage 1-3 fibrosis. DUR-928 was orally administered daily in 65 patients at 50 mg (n=23), 150 mg (n=21), or 600 mg (300 mg BID (n=21)) for 4 weeks and patients were followed up for an additional 4 weeks.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Data from the trial were presented at The Liver Meeting Digital Experience™ 2020 (AASLD) and the 2021 International Liver Conference (EASL). DUR-928 led to improvement from baseline in several of the treatment groups in&nbsp;</em><strong><em>liver enzymes</em></strong><em>&nbsp;such as ALT, AST, and GGT and&nbsp;</em><strong><em>serum lipid profiles</em></strong><em>&nbsp;such as LDL-C, non-HDLC, and triglycerides, in addition to&nbsp;</em><strong><em>liver fat</em></strong><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><strong><em>biomarkers of liver health</em></strong><em>, such as CK-18, a cell death biomarker. Dosing of DUR-928 additionally resulted in an&nbsp;</em><strong><em>improvement from baseline in liver stiffness</em></strong><em>, assessed by transient elastography (TE), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and the liver fibrosis marker pro-C3.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>DUR-928 also showed an approximate 20% median reduction from baseline of HOMA-IR, an important indicator of insulin resistance, observed after only 4 weeks of daily oral administration at the 50 mg and 150 mg dose levels, a similar level of reductions as seen in longer-term studies of several well-established diabetes therapeutics. DUR-928 was well tolerated at all three doses with no serious adverse events reported.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Overall, the promising safety and early efficacy data presented at these two prestigious liver conferences underscore the potential of DUR-928 for the treatment of people with NASH, the most severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, affecting 3-5% of the U.S. population, with no approved drugs available.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Give a glance at Phase 1 data of DUR-928 in Hepatic Impairment.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:</strong>&nbsp;<em>This Phase 1 open-label, multicenter US study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a single oral dose of DUR-928 in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (HI).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Overall, DUR-928 was safe and well-tolerated by all HI subjects with no adverse events and no dose-limiting toxicity reported throughout the study. These safety results are impressive given how sick this patient population is. We also confirmed that, as expected, subjects with impaired liver function had higher drug exposure than matched control subjects with normal liver function and that the more impaired the liver was, the higher the drug exposure was. We believe that this is a promising finding as patients with more impaired livers may benefit from more exposure to DUR-928. An equally exciting finding was that a single oral dose of DUR-928 resulted in a statistically significant median reduction from baseline of the apoptosis (cell death) biomarker M30 (cCK-18) at 12 hours post-dose.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the key takeaways of the DUR-928 posters presented at EASL 2021?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:</strong>&nbsp;<em>The totality of the safety and early efficacy data presented at EASL this year in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatic impairment (HI) patients, together with outstanding safety and efficacy profiles observed in a previously completed Phase 2a trial evaluating DUR-928 in patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), highlights the potential of DUR-928 to treat multiple severe chronics and acute liver diseases.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you planning to evaluate DUR-928 in other indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:</strong>&nbsp;<em>DURECT’s lead indication for DUR-928 is alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), a life-threatening acute liver disease with no approved treatment and a 26% mortality rate within 28 days of hospitalization, higher than most cancers. What physicians have available to them today primarily involves abstinence and supportive care, which includes nutrition and hydration. Corticosteroids are used in some cases but have been shown to have no survival benefit at 90 days or 1 year.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Unfortunately, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of AH was increasing in younger patients and during the pandemic alcohol consumption in the US has increased by about 30%. AH has a significant economic cost to the healthcare system as well. The average hospitalization cost for an AH patient is more than $50,000 in the first year and there are about 132,000 hospitalizations per year in the US. Alcoholic liver disease is becoming a leading cause of liver transplants in the US and the cost of a liver transplant exceeds $875,000</em><strong><em>.&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We estimate the annual cost of AH to the US healthcare system to be as high as $6 billion.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Results from a completed&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.durect.com/pipeline/dur-928/alcoholic-hepatitis/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Phase 2a trial</em></a><em>&nbsp;evaluating DUR-928 in 19 AH patients showed that 100% of the patients treated with DUR-928 lived past 28 days. Based on the degree of liver damage in these patients, historical data suggests that several of them were likely to not survive 28 days, yet all of them did survive. In addition, 14 of the 19 patients left the hospital within four days of receiving a single dose. DUR-928 was well tolerated in all patients with no serious drug-related adverse events reported in the trial. Based on this encouraging data and the high degree of unmet need, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for DUR-928 in the treatment of AH.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The company is currently advancing a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial,&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.durect.com/clinical-trials/ahfirm/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>AHFIRM</em></a><em>, to evaluate DUR-928’s life-saving ability in approximately 300 patients with severe AH. In the US, we have now opened about 75% of the planned US clinical sites, and are on track to open additional sites in the UK, Europe, and Australia in the coming months.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In parallel, DURECT continues to explore NASH and other potential acute and chronic indications that could benefit from DUR-928’s unique mechanism of action.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is DUR-928? Discuss epigenetic regulation and DUR-928’s MOA and its potential to treat multiple liver diseases.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:&nbsp;</strong><em>DUR-928 is an endogenous epigenetic regulator. The vast majority of what is in the nucleus of a cell is not DNA but proteins and other molecules that determine which genes are expressed and are known as the epigenome. DUR-928 binds to and inhibits the activity of DNMT-1, 3a, and 3b, which are epigenetic regulating enzymes that add methyl groups to DNA in a process called DNA methylation.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>DNA methylation and demethylation regulate the expression of genes, especially clusters of master genes that further modulate crucial cellular activities. DNA hypermethylation has been associated with certain diseases, including alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By inhibiting DNMT activity, DUR-928 inhibits DNA methylation thereby regulating the expression of genes that modulate crucial cellular activities including those associated with cell death, stress response, and lipid biosynthesis.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These modulations can lead to improved organ function and survival, reduced lipid accumulation, and inflammation, as we have observed in various&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;animal models and the promising results from our completed clinical trials in AH and NASH.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What motivates you to work on NASH and other hepatic diseases? Do you feel competition in this space?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:&nbsp;</strong><em>Let me start with our lead indication of alcohol-associated hepatitis or AH. These patients are hospitalized and facing a high risk of mortality within a short period, with 29% mortality within 90 days of hospitalization. There are currently no treatments approved, so these patients are in desperate need of treatment. The best you can hope for when you develop a drug is that it will save patients’ lives. We believe that DUR-928 has that potential and that possibility drives us every day.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>NASH is a chronic disease that also has no currently approved therapeutics. The time course of the disease is much longer than AH, but some NASH patients do advance to where the disease can cause liver failure and mortality. We believe DUR-928’s mechanism of action is well-suited for treating both AH and NASH and are motivated by the prospect of improving or even potentially saving the lives of many patients in need.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Regarding competition, there are no drugs approved to treat AH. The drugs used today have been shown not to improve the long-term survival of AH patients. There are other clinical trials evaluating drugs approved for other indications to see if they might be helpful in AH, but we have not seen anything comparable to the outstanding clinical benefit we saw in our Phase 2a trial. In NASH, there are several other therapeutics in development but, we do not believe any of them have demonstrated the breadth of activity combined with the safety profile we have seen with DUR-928. DUR-928 has a unique mechanism of action and is the first epigenetic regulator in development for these difficult-to-treat indications.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>&nbsp;We believe it has great potential and could change the treatment landscape for AH patients and potentially many other acute organ injuries and certain chronic diseases, including NASH.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you think this drug will bring change in the lives of patients with hepatic disorders?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:&nbsp;</strong><em>As I mentioned in the previous question, we are evaluating DUR-928’s ability to save the lives of hospitalized AH patients. One aspect of this that may not be appreciated is that some AH patients at the highest risk of death receive liver transplants if they meet strict eligibility requirements and a liver is available for them. If DUR-928 can reverse the course of that patient’s AH, the donated liver that would have gone to that patient would now be available for another patient waiting on the liver transplant list. So, saving one AH patient’s life may also save the life of the patient who was next in line on the transplant list.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Considering the outstanding safety and efficacy data observed for alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) in our Phase 2a trial, DUR-928 has the potential to fundamentally change the lives of these patients. We are talking about a disease for which about a quarter of hospitalized patients die within a month, and all patients treated with DUR-928 during our Phase 2a trial survived the 28-day follow-up period. Three-fourths even went home after the first 4 days.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The safety and initial efficacy data observed during our Phase 1 trials in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatic impairment (HI) patients add to the body of evidence supporting the potential of DUR-928 to change the lives of many patients with hepatic disorders that currently lack treatment options.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the growth of the company and its plans in the coming future.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:&nbsp;</strong><em>This is a very exciting time for DURECT. If we can demonstrate a robust mortality benefit in our ongoing&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.durect.com/clinical-trials/ahfirm/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>AHFIRM</em></a><em>&nbsp;trial, we believe it will support an NDA filing. In addition to the possibility of saving AH patients’ lives, one of the exciting things about AH from a corporate standpoint is that we believe it would also be an attractive commercial opportunity to create value for our shareholders and save the healthcare system significant money at the same time. Each AH patient costs the healthcare system over $50,000 on average, largely in the form of long hospital stays, sometimes in the ICU. We believe AH represents an attractive opportunity for the company to develop its commercial team and launch our first pharmaceutical product.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We also believe that DUR-928’s mechanism of action may address underlying epigenetic dysregulation associated with many additional acute and chronic conditions, including NASH.</em></p>

<p><em>The study found that 9 out of 10 patients treated with Taltz (89.6%, n=206) showed maintenance of efficacy with no radiographic progression for up to two years, as measured by the mean change from baseline of modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS) &lt;2. Overall mean rates of progression were low among patients treated with Taltz. These results were similar among patients who were previously treated with anti-TNF therapy (88%, n= 106) and those who had not previously been treated with a biologic (91%, n=100). In addition to known predictors, the novel finding is that attainment of remission of inflammation on MRI at one year protected from progression at two years.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Justin:</strong><em> The FDA approval of LUMAKRAS&nbsp;is based on results from a subset of patients in&nbsp;CodeBreaK&nbsp;100, the largest clinical trial conducted to date exclusively for patients with the&nbsp;KRAS&nbsp;G12C mutation.

In the trial, 960 mg of LUMAKRAS administered orally once-daily demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) (a proportion of patients with = 30% decrease in the <em>tumor) of 36% (95% CI: 28-45) with 81% (95% CI: 73-87) of patients achieving disease control (percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease for more than three months). The median duration of response (DoR) was 10 months. The most common adverse reactions (= 20%) were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, and cough. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of LUMAKRAS occurred in 9% of patients</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Tuba: What was the basis for the approval of Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;as the first and only liquid biopsy companion diagnostic for Amgen’s LUMAKRAS inhibitor?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Justin:</strong><em> </em><em>The Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;FDA approval was based on clinical validation data from the&nbsp;CodeBreaK&nbsp;100 trial evaluating&nbsp;sotorasib&nbsp;in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Patients identified with the&nbsp;KRAS&nbsp;G12C mutation using the Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;demonstrated an objective response rate consistent with those identified using traditional tissue-based biomarker testing.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>Can you explain the&nbsp;CodeBreaK&nbsp;100 trial data that validated the use of&nbsp;Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;to detect&nbsp;<em>KRAS</em>&nbsp;G12C-mutated NSCLC and what it showed?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Justin:</strong><em> </em><em>Guardant360&nbsp;CDx’s&nbsp;FDA approval was based on&nbsp;sotorasib&nbsp;efficacy in subjects from&nbsp;CodeBreaK&nbsp;100 that tested positive for&nbsp;KRAS&nbsp;G12C mutations&nbsp;by the Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;test. In this population, the observed ORR was highly similar to that observed in the overall drug registration population.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why is Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;so important for oncologists? Why do they turn to it for comprehensive genomic profiling?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Justin:</strong><em> </em><em>Medical guidelines recommend comprehensive genomic profiling before starting treatment in late-stage and metastatic solid cancers. The Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;test provides comprehensive genomic profiling for patients with solid tumors from a simple blood draw, providing the genomic information necessary for oncologists to make informed treatment decisions in just seven days. This is critical for three reasons: first, comprehensive genomic profiling is mandatory in oncology as it provides the information necessary to properly select therapy and provides patients access to modern targeted agents. Second,&nbsp;Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;provides this information from a simple blood draw, which allows some&nbsp;patients to avoid the pain, risk,&nbsp;expense, and delays of invasive tissue biopsy, while for others for whom this biopsy is not an option, it is the only route by&nbsp;which they can benefit from many modern therapies. Third, by&nbsp;returning results in just seven days, Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;puts this critical information in the hands of the physician before treatment decisions are made. Together, these allow more patients to benefit from modern targeted anti-cancer therapies like LUMAKRAS (sotorasib).</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>What are the key benefits resulting from the collaboration between Amgen and Guardant Health?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Justin:</strong><em> The collaboration between Amgen and Guardant Health provides patients with less-invasive testing and quicker results to determine eligibility for targeted therapy, like LUMAKRAS (sotorasib). This collaboration has led and will continue to lead to more patients being able to access optimal treatment and benefit from modern targeted therapies, and other breakthrough therapies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is genomic profiling? How has it changed treatment in non-small cell lung cancer?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Justin:</strong><em> </em><em>Traditionally, medical testing in oncology has assessed a single biomarker at a time. In modern oncology, however, the number and complexity of biomarkers whose status is necessary to know before therapy selection has rendered inadequate such “one at a time” single biomarker testing approaches. &nbsp;Instead, modern molecular oncology diagnostics now rely on genomic profiling, which is a broad, comprehensive assessment of all relevant biomarkers simultaneously. &nbsp;This allows physicians a complete understanding of patients’ tumors and allows consideration of all therapeutic options, including those for whom only certain patients are eligible. &nbsp;This is critical as these agents are often associated with markedly improved survival and quality of life relative to non-targeted therapies. &nbsp;Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;was the first liquid biopsy ever approved by the FDA for genomic profiling.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In non-small cell lung cancer specifically, medical guidelines have expanded over the past 10 years and now recommend all patients with metastatic or advanced disease undergo biomarker testing for&nbsp;EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, NTRK, MET, RET, ERBB2,&nbsp;and&nbsp;KRAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, about half of all patients with NSCLC harbor a targetable driver mutation, each of which represents critical treatment opportunities.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>Beyond this FDA approval of Guardant360&nbsp;CDx, what new and important developments are on the horizon for the test?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Justin:</strong><em> Guardant360&nbsp;CDx&nbsp;offers comprehensive genomic profiling for the standard of care treatment of patients today; however, oncology is advancing rapidly, with more new options for patients being approved every year. &nbsp;Guardant360 continues to evolve to match this innovation, with a 500-gene version of the test already being available for patient care testing today. &nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Beyond adding new biomarkers, the way in which patients can benefit from liquid biopsies is also evolving. For example, Guardant360’s non-invasive approach allows repeated sampling over time, which enables physicians to more rapidly and accurately detect which patients are benefiting from specific therapies and which are not. This has great potential in both clinical care and biopharmaceutical development, and you can expect to hear more from Guardant Health in this area in the near future.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are there any patients support programs for non-small cell lung cancer that have been developed by Amgen and Guardant Health?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Justin:</strong><em> Guardant Health’s mission is to expand patient access to the best care possible, regardless of insurance coverage or treatment location. &nbsp;In support of this, Guardant has launched the “Clear Your View’’ educational campaign, which aims to provide all oncologists the knowledge and tools necessary to use comprehensive genotyping for their patients. Our hope is that by offering an FDA-approved</em> blood test for this purpose, we can help encourage all clinicians to perform our test to see if their patient has an actionable mutation that can benefit from <em>targeted therapy. Guardant Health also has a robust patient financial assistance program designed to make quality cancer diagnostics accessible to all patients.

<p>In an interview with PharmaShots, Andrew Greenspan, VP, Immunology Affairs at Janssen shared his views on the new AGA guidelines on the medical management of moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease and also highlighted about Janssen’s efforts in improving the QoL of patients with CD</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the new AGA guidelines on the medical management of Crohn’s disease?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>The&nbsp;American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) regularly reviews its clinical guidelines for accuracy, relevance, and clinical impact in order to provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations to help guide clinical practice decisions; recently, it&nbsp;published&nbsp;its new clinical guidelines recommending therapies for the management of luminal and fistulizing Crohn’s disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Crohn’s disease is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects an estimated 3 million Americans and 2.5 million Europeans. Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with no known cause or cure.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The organization evaluated the overall benefit and efficacy of available biologic therapies against one another for these guidelines, including assessment of the use of thiopurines, methotrexate, and anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a biologic drugs for the induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory Crohn’s disease.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>At Janssen, we are proud that the AGA’s new guidelines highlight STELARA</em><em>® (ustekinumab) as a recommended first-line treatment option, especially for those who have been previously unresponsive to anti-TNF agents. We believe this guideline supports the safety, efficacy&nbsp;and durability STELARA offers people living with Crohn’s disease, as well as Janssen’s goal of making STELARA the worldwide standard of care in IBD.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the key takeaways of AGA guidelines updates.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>The main takeaway of the updated AGA guidelines is that biologics are noted as the most effective treatments for the management of Crohn’s disease, with STELARA recommended as a first-line treatment option, especially for patients who have been previously unresponsive to anti-TNF agents. The recommendation can be attributed to the vast body of clinical evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of STELARA and is a vote of confidence for an additional advanced treatment for people living with Crohn’s disease around the world and the physicians who treat them.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The&nbsp;American Gastroenterological Association&nbsp;highlights that biologics should be used early in a patient’s treatment journey, rather than delaying their use until after failure of mesalamine and/or corticosteroids, in patients with moderate to severe or fistulizing Crohn’s disease. The guidelines also highlight anti-TNF agents for the management of Crohn’s disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the importance of these guidelines for patients with Crohn’s disease?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>People living with Crohn’s disease deserve safe, effective, and convenient therapeutic options that can provide both rapid response and lasting remission. Adding to the body of evidence for these options helps us evaluate what may be the best choice for a particular person, especially as we see new advances, like biologic treatments, continuing to offer patients relief from the symptoms of moderate to severe Crohn’s disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As Janssen strives to provide safe and effective treatment options, we support the&nbsp;American Gastroenterological Association’s&nbsp;commitment to keep its members, patients, and the public at large apprised of the most current best practices, through regular review of its clinical guidelines, to&nbsp;provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations and to&nbsp;achieve the highest possible quality of patient care.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the treatment goals for Crohn’s disease?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>As individuals with immune-mediated diseases often undergo long treatment journeys and can suffer for years before receiving an advanced or proper treatment, I’m always energized by the Janssen team’s work to drive innovation every day and help those living with these diseases.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This is especially true in the area of Crohn’s disease; as there is currently no cure for Crohn’s disease, a focus on clinical response, preventing flare-ups of symptoms, and remission is paramount when considering a patient’s treatment goals.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the study designs and outcomes from the SEAVUE study.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Until now, there were no head-to-head trials comparing the safety and efficacy of the leading prescription biologics that treat Crohn’s disease. In the absence of direct head-to-head evidence, a multitude of indirect comparisons are often used to evaluate therapies—this can create uncertainty among physicians when determining which course of treatment may be best for their Crohn’s disease patients in the first-line setting.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To help physicians and patients make more informed treatment choices, we boldly conducted the first head-to-head Crohn’s disease trial in bio-naïve patients with STELARA and adalimumab therapies; namely, SEAVUE was a multicenter, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, active-controlled study in adult patients with Crohn’s disease.&nbsp;</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Janssen is committed to relentlessly advancing care for those living with chronic, difficult-to-manage immune-mediated diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease, encompassing Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, is a key area of focus for Janssen.

<p>In an interview with PharmaShots,<strong> Jan Wehkamp, M.D., Vice President, Disease Area Leader, Gastroenterology at Janssen Research &amp; Development </strong>shared his views on the data regarding the safety &amp; efficacy of Stelara (ustekinumab) for UC patients, including long-term symptomatic &amp; corticosteroid-free remission rates from the UNIFI study.</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the key points of the data of Stelara presented at ECCO.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Jan Wehkamp:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Most importantly, we perform long-term studies of medications like this because we know patients living with ulcerative colitis (UC) deserve therapies that can provide long-lasting efficacy, rapid response, and sustained remission without the need for long-term use of steroids. Study results from our&nbsp;new Phase 3 UNIFI long-term extension (LTE) show STELARA&nbsp;(ustekinumab) delivered sustained symptomatic remission rates among the majority of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC with no new safety signals present through nearly three years. Among patients who achieved clinical response at maintenance baseline and were randomized to STELARA 90mg, every eight weeks (q8w) or every 12 weeks (q12w), 55.2 percent of patients were in symptomatic remission at week 152.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Among patients who had achieved clinical response at maintenance baseline and were randomized to STELARA 90mg every q8w or q12w, 96.4 percent (185/192) of patients in symptomatic remission at week 152 were corticosteroid-free. This is important because while short-term steroid use is very common for the treatment of&nbsp;inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to help address inflammation, it is not advisable for the long-term management of the disease, as it can be associated with several debilitating side effects and comorbidities including increased blood pressure, the </em>onset of diabetes, and decrease of bone strength. Results from the UNIFI study underscore not only the potential STELARA has in treating UC symptoms in the long term<em>, but the importance of delivering treatment options that do not require the long-term use of corticosteroids.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In terms of safety findings, safety was evaluated at week 156 for all patients (n=588) who were treated in the LTE. Findings showed no new safety signals were present.&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What does long term extension study depict?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Jan Wehkamp:</strong>&nbsp;<em>A long-term extension study allows researchers to better understand the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of medications in a clinical setting over at least 5 years.&nbsp;</em><em>In the UNIFI study, results showed&nbsp;</em><em>55.2 percent of patients treated with STELARA were in symptomatic remission at week 152 and 96.4 percent (185/192) of patients in symptomatic remission at week 152 were corticosteroid-free.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Will these long-term data of the drug bring change for patients who are still struggling to manage their disease and achieve remission?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Jan Wehkamp:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Despite recent substantial therapeutic gains, many patients living with UC still struggle to find lasting relief from their disease symptoms in the long term. We are hopeful that the results of the UNIFI study can inform physicians and their patients about the potential role that STELARA has as a long-term treatment option in adults with moderately to severely active UC.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the study design of the P-III UNIFI Trial.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Jan Wehkamp:</strong>&nbsp;<em>UNIFI is a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of STELARA induction and maintenance dosing for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC in adults who demonstrated an inadequate response to or were unable to tolerate conventional (i.e., corticosteroids, immunomodulators) or biologic (i.e., one or more TNF blockers or vedolizumab) therapies.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The induction study was of at least eight weeks duration for each participant. 523 intravenous induction responders were then randomized to subcutaneous maintenance therapy through 44 weeks: 175 patients on placebo, 172 patients treated with STELARA 90mg every 12 weeks, and 176 patients treated with STELARA 90mg every 8 weeks. 284 STELARA patients who completed week 44 entered the LTE. Placebo patients were discontinued after week 44 unblinding.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Starting at week 56, randomized patients with UC worsening could adjust to STELARA treatment every 8 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in randomized patients using symptomatic remission (Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0).</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Safety was evaluated for all 588 patients who were treated in the LTE, including the randomized and nonrandomized populations. Through week 156, 131 patients continued on placebo and 457 patients received STELARA. The nonrandomized population included STELARA induction nonresponders at week 8 who received subcutaneous STELARA and responded 8 weeks later and responders to placebo induction.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you think your competition in this space (for example Humira) would have similar power to treat UC?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Jan Wehkamp:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>There are many different treatment options available for patients living with moderately to severely active UC. Every patient is different, so there are several factors that go into choosing the best treatment option, some of which can include the severity of disease, symptoms, and quality of life. Ultimately, the treatment decision is up to a physician and their patient. We hope that these long-term STELARA data can help inform these decisions</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the company’s other efforts in treating gastroenterological disorders?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Jan Wehkamp:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Janssen continues to conduct research and development efforts to advance the treatment of gastroenterological disorders such as UC and Crohn’s disease (CD). In addition to UC, STELARA is approved for the treatment of adult patients (18 years and older) with moderately to severely active CD. We are also studying STELARA in treat-to-target settings in the STARDUST study, which is the first study to compare treat-to-target and standard care treatment strategies using endoscopy to guide dose adjustment in the treat-to-target group to help inform future treatment strategies. STARDUST is also the first to evaluate non-invasive intestinal ultrasound in an interventional setting.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additionally, we are studying the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA(guselkumab) as a potential treatment option in adult patients with moderately to severely active CD with inadequate response or</em> <em>intolerance to conventional therapies and/or biologics in the Phase 2 GALAXI study. TREMFYA is also being studied in a Phase 2b/3 program in UC and in </em>Phase 1 clinical trial in celiac disease.&nbsp;There are also other compounds in earlier-stage clinical studies, including an oral gut-selective pan-JAK inhibitor and an oral gut-restricted IL-23 receptor antagonist – in Phase 2 development, and two oral IL-23 receptor antagonists<em> candidates currently in Phase 1 clinical development.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What makes Stelara unique from its other competitors? Discuss it in terms of its MOA.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Jan Wehkamp:</strong>&nbsp;<em>STELARA is a fully human monoclonal antibody and is the first biologic treatment to selectively inhibit the interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 pathways. In targeting both IL-12/23 pathways, STELARA has been approved to treat a range of autoimmune diseases in various patient groups including adults and children six years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, adult patients (18 years or older) with active psoriatic arthritis, adult patients (18 years and older) with moderately to severely active CD and adult patients (18 years and older) with moderately to severely active UC.</em></p>

<p><strong>Konstantin:</strong> <em>It gives us additional resources to help us scale our team to achieve our mission: Make the best-in-class therapy available to every chronic disease patient. More concretely, the investment will grow the commercial team and accelerate product and partnership development to help more Americans access Kaia Health MSK and expand the offering to COPD care. In addition, the funds will be invested in extending the offering within Europe and increasing access to Kaia by making its MSK and COPD available through national reimbursement systems.

<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Who are the lead investors behind the Series C funding?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Konstantin:</strong> <em>Fundraising was led by an unnamed leading growth equity fund with support from existing investors including Optum Ventures, Idinvest, 3VC, Balderton Capital, Heartcore Capital, Symphony Ventures (investment vehicle of four times Major winner Rory McIlroy, pro golfer), and A Round Capital.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the impact of the pandemic on Kaia Health’s growth?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Konstantin:</strong> <em>Our customer base grew by 600% over the last 12 months. Pre-pandemic only around 20% of organizations were interested in offering a digital therapy solution. During the pandemic, chronic disease treatments were considered elective treatments and were thus very hard to get access. Out of necessity, 100% of organizations transitioned to offering digital health services. Patients now got used to the new level of convenience and we are convinced that this trend is here to stay.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How will this funding be helpful for patients with chronic diseases?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Konstantin:</strong> <em>We will use it to expand our product capabilities and thereby make our product more effective and easier to use and integrate into</em> the daily life of our patients. Furthermore, we can greatly increase our reach by making it available to more patients through employers and health plans in the US, and by integrating it into<em> national reimbursement systems in Europe. All of this comes at no direct cost for chronic disease patients.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Do you think your digital approach to treating chronic pain related to MSK disorders and COPD will replace the traditional therapies?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Konstantin:</strong> <em>No, we never saw ourselves as a replacement to the traditional multimodal therapies or even to physical therapy. The problem in the healthcare systems we operate in is that a lot of people do not have access to these very effective and cost-efficient treatments and therefore proceed in their chronification and only get referred to the best available treatments when it’s almost too late, leading to unnecessary suffering and high costs. Or even worse, have to undergo more invasive treatments such as orthopedic surgery (for MSK) or lung transplantations (for COPD). Our digital approach reduces the care gap to best-in-class treatments and patients can have access to treatments much earlier in the journey and at a large scale</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the MoA, RoA, and other specifications of INT230-6 (PORT-1).</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Ian:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;INT230-6 (PORT-1) is an intratumoral amphiphilic formulation that delivers potent cancer-killing agents directly into almost any tumor. The technology allows for the drugs to get specifically into cancer cells and spare healthy ones. This route of administration aims to immediately reduce the cancer burden by directly killing the injected tumor and presenting the tumor antigens to the immune system. It also breaks down the cytokine wall and recruits immune cells to attack microscopic and metastatic disease (which weren’t injected).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Used alone or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, PORT-1 may lead to improved survival by delivering a greater amount of drug directly to the tumor without unwanted toxic side effects often seen with intravenous infusion. PORT-1 targets cancer cells to trigger a robust immune response not only at the site of the primary tumor but also systemically without exposing healthy tissue in the body to harsh medicines.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>PORT-1’s efficacy and safety profile have been demonstrated in interim data from a Phase 1/2 study for the treatment of refractory solid tumors. Data demonstrate that the technology allows for doses in excess of 3x the typical systemic dose to be administered safely and directly to the tumor being targeted. The increased potency halts cancer proliferation and initiates cell death in a way that stimulates the immune system to recognize cancer and fight distal tumors and unseen metastases.</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Data thus far have shown that both INT230-6 (PORT-1) monotherapy and combination therapy are well-tolerated with direct tumor-killing effects and generate responses in un-injected tumors likely from antigen presentation and immune activation. The data for PORT-1 as monotherapy demonstrated an estimated 62% of patients alive at one year across all tumor types. An exploratory analysis of patients who received =50% of the tumor dosed (higher dose) had an estimated 78% one-year survival.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Can you discuss the company’s recent progress and near-term goals?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Ian:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;In April 2021, we dosed the first patient in the PRECIOUS Phase 1 study of PORT-3, our iNKT antagonist (IMM60) co-packaged with NY-ESO-1 immunogenic peptides. In August, we commenced Phase 1/2 clinical trials of PORT-2, a liposomal formulation of IMM60, both as a monotherapy and in combination with standard of care (Keytruda) in melanoma and NSCLC.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Pulling from the newly secured $26.5 million gross proceeds from our recent public offering, we’re able to accelerate development activities and provide two years of capital runway, enough to complete Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for all three clinical assets. We’re also on a trajectory to achieve numerous milestones across our pipeline including preparing the next leads to start human testing.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: As per your pipeline, you have collaborated with multiple companies. Are you open to more collaboration in the future?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Ian:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We are certainly open to more collaboration in the future. It is a priority for us to continue to build relationships with prospective collaborators, including potential big pharma partners, as we continue to build out our clinical pipeline to accelerate the entry of first-in-class cancer treatments to market.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are your long-term goals, where do you expect the growth of the company in a long run?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Ian:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Our long-term goal is to advance new therapeutic opportunities for people with cancer who currently have limited or no treatment options. To do this, we plan to progress our existing technology platforms and grow our product engine with additional platforms over the coming months and years.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Ultimately, we hope that our programs can make a significant impact on the cancer treatment landscape and can help overcome resistance to current therapies. We are continually pursuing innovative opportunities to increase the success of both monotherapies and combination treatments.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you expecting BTD, FTD from global regulatory authorities for your therapies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Ian:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We are leveraging strong data (both preclinical and clinical) across all of our platforms to progress through clinical development and work toward approval as quickly as possible. We are pleased that the FDA recognized the potential of PORT-1 (INT230-6) and has granted it fast track designation (FTD) for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. There are still many other cancers that we are studying, and that have limited therapeutic options. Hopefully, we will see this change in our lifetime.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>In an interview with PharmaShots, Kelly Pokuta, Vice President of Pharmaceutical Trade Relations, and April Kunze, Senior Director, Clinical Formulary Development &amp; Trend Management Strategy at Prime therapeutics share their views on the MedDrive as a first-of-its-kind medical drug management program uniquely aligned with Blue Plan clients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Prime introduced the first-of-its-kind medical drug management solution with an aligned approach to drive down costs for high-cost specialty drugs that now make up more than 50% of total drug costs</li><li>The MedDrive program will be launched in multiple phases. The first phase focuses on drug savings strategies through greater biosimilar drug adoption. Other elements include benefit designs that prefer lowest net cost non-biosimilar drugs with enhancements to predictive data analytics, medical sourcing opportunities, and consultation services</li><li>MedDrive will tackle the toughest challenges facing growing medical Rx drug spend, harnessing the savings in biosimilars</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the main concern of this new medical drug management program? What are your beliefs regarding this program?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>April Kunze:</strong> <em>There are many new products coming to market to treat novel conditions and many additional products being approved, creating opportunities for preferred product strategies on the medical benefit.&nbsp; The rise in drug spending in medical creates an opportunity to more closely evaluate drug coverage and assure appropriate use and encourage low-cost therapies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Kelly Pokuta: </em></strong><em>Prime is in a unique position to work with our Blues Plans to truly integrate data and drug coverage across benefits and manage total drug spend. Total drug management is how we’re truly going to get a handle on rising drug prices. Yet today, managing&nbsp;both&nbsp;pharmacy and medical drug spend is a challenge for most in the industry due to a lack of integration.&nbsp;Prime receives both pharmacy and medical drug claims data making this strategy possible for our clients to achieve. This new offering by Prime Therapeutics is the first program that aligns market-leading health plans to leverage market share and drive savings.&nbsp; This puts Prime in the unique position to deliver fully transparent total drug management solutions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>As drug prices are a major concern for many Americans, how MedDrive will help Blue Plan clients?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>April Kunze: </em></strong><em>Rising drug costs are a big part of today’s health care crisis. According to data from the IQVIA Institute as noted in this&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2019/03/08/biologic-medicines-the-biggest-driver-of-rising-drug-prices/?sh=45843e9218b0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Forbes article</a>&nbsp;(2018), biologic drugs have accounted for nearly all (93%) of the net drug spending growth since 2014. The more plans come together around the </em>interchangeability of biosimilars and prefer the lower cost options instead of high-cost reference brand biologics, the<em> more they can obtain market-leading savings. These savings can help hold down premium costs for their members. &nbsp;Aligning our Blues also helps create a cohesive message for members and providers across the health plans&nbsp;and alignment provides more value in general.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>How this program is different and what motivates you to work on medical drug management strategies?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>April Kunze: </strong>Again, this new offering is the first program that aligns market-leading health plans to leverage market share and drive savings, which, puts Prime in the unique position to deliver fully transparent total drug management solutions. It’s also different in that it’ll also be bringing key parts of the health care industry together – such as providers, specialty pharmacies, and manufacturers –&nbsp;to help ensure biosimilars are accepted and used as equally safe and effective treatments so people can benefit from the most appropriate drug at the lowest net cost drug.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Prime’s vast experience in evaluating drugs clinically and evaluating appropriate use for both clinical &amp; financial reasons, we are well-positioned with our Blues to provide consultative services to help them better manage their medical drug spend. In addition, aligning strategies across our Blues helps to strengthen their position in managing <em>low net cost products.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Prime is also evaluating additional programs and services that will roll up under MedDrive and more information will be available at a future time.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>Highlight the key features of MedDrive? Discuss the importance of this program for patients as wells as HCPs.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta: &nbsp;</strong><em>MedDrive&nbsp;combines Prime’s medical drug management solutions all in one product to help our health plan clients manage costly medicines and align to help realize these savings. Prime is harnessing the collective strength of Blue Plan alignment on preferred drug lists to drive to the lowest cost drug options, including preferring biosimilars when it helps members and plans get the right drug at the lowest possible cost. MedDrive also includes other market-leading cost-saving</em> strategies supported by analytics and reporting, such as<em> medical policies&nbsp;and clinical tools, consultative services to navigate the growing specialty landscape, provider and member education and support, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>April Kunze: </strong><em>MedDrive is important to patients and health care providers in that&nbsp;clinically appropriate drugs are selected for preferred coverage, ensuring that the member’s health is not compromised. Our positions are reviewed by our National P&amp;T Committee, comprised of clinicians practicing throughout the nation and across many specialties.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Prime recognizes the importance of the provider to deliver high-quality</em> care and the need for cost-efficient options to manage a patient’s out-of-pocket<em> expense.&nbsp; Providing quality solutions that improve affordability is a key focus of MedDrive.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the different phases of the MedDrive program?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta: </strong><em>The first phase (described above) is underway, but timing varies by program and client. Some clients can implement as early as 7/1/21 or anytime thereafter. Additionally, state-specific requirements on notification of changes may impact implementation timing.&nbsp; We expect the first phase to take approximately through 2021.&nbsp; We are in the planning process for the second and subsequent phases at this time, but we will add more tools to the MedDrive toolkit as the program expands.&nbsp;Prime will continue to build the MedDrive offering s and more information will become available in the near future.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does biosimilars adoption leads to savings while offering patients safe and effective treatments?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta: &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Implementing MedDrive is a multi-year strategy for our clients and the biosimilars as a cost savings driver is key. We expect that medical drug management strategies, such as maximizing medical savings and preferring biosimilars, can lead to hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in medical drug savings for health plans over 5 years. &nbsp;In fact, Prime has been achieving success with biosimilars already&nbsp;as we tested these strategies with a few clients in advance of launching MedDrive.&nbsp; In the oncology class, one client shifted the use of biosimilars from single digits (0%-25%) to 80-90% and saved several hundreds of millions of dollars and overall PMPM savings. If all clients adopted this strategy savings would be considerable.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Let us know about the key points of the report given by IQVIA on biosimilars?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Kelly Pokuta: &nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We can’t speak for them, however, here is a link to IQVIA’s 2020 report so you can review:&nbsp;</em><em><a href=""https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/biosimilars-in-the-united-states-2020-2024"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/biosimilars-in-the-united-states-2020-2024</a></em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What we found most interesting was the statement “Though savings from biosimilars had been slow to build, recently-launched biosimilars have achieved significant uptake within their first year, and the availability and use of biosimilar medicines is on track to reduce drug costs by $100 billion over the next five years.” Additionally, this key point was of interest: “The three most recent biosimilar launches are set to reach nearly 60% shares of volume by the end of their second year on the market — significantly higher and faster than prior biosimilars.”</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>This reflects the growing trend of utilizing biosimilars across many different disease states. More and more groups are releasing statements supporting biosimilar use which is also helpful in supporting this trend.</em><em></em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Unveil the key points of the collaboration signed between Prime Therapeutics and Blue Plans.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>MedDrive is a new product Prime is offering to its Blue Plan clients, not a separate contract they need to sign with us. Clients interested in helping to drive down the costs of drugs will be working with Prime to deploy many of the approaches this product offers.&nbsp; A few plan clients have already been testing out some of the biosimilar strategies and are seeing success.&nbsp; (See response to Q6.) plus these specific drug examples include:</em><em></em></p>

If it were not for these biosimilars, the number of patients could access these medicines would be limited, the report concludes.”&nbsp;“A crucial element to the role of biosimilars, the report found, is that they are not only less expensive than brand name biologics themselves, they also apply competitive pressure to the brand name drugs. The result is that those brand name biologics also keep their prices down.” “It is clear, especially with the results of this report, that biosimilar competition lowers drug prices,” said Meaghan Rose Smith, Executive Director of the Biosimilars Forum, in a press release. “As the next generation of generics, biosimilars have the potential to significantly save patients and taxpayers money, and increase access to life-saving treatment options.”&nbsp;</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is PRX004? Discuss the potential of the therapy in ATTR cardiomyopathy. </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brandon Smith:</strong>&nbsp;<em>PRX004 is a phase 2 ready anti-amyloid immunotherapy uniquely designed to deplete the amyloid deposits that are associated with the disease pathology of ATTR amyloidosis. As part of the acquisition, Novo Nordisk will initially focus on the clinical development of PRX004 in ATTR cardiomyopathy – an underdiagnosed and potentially fatal form of ATTR amyloidosis characterized by the build-up of amyloid deposits in cardiac tissue.&nbsp;</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brandon Smith:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We are committed to developing novel and transformative medicines and treatments to create a better future for people in critical need of new treatment options and we know that this need is greater than ever. This transaction allows us to deploy additional resources to focus on the execution of the AFFIRM-AL trial, a confirmatory study of birtamimab in Stage IV AL amyloidosis patients and to advance our robust Alzheimer’s portfolio. We remain focused on our path forward and this is what fuels our mission every day.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the P-I results of PRX004 supporting the potential of the therapy in ATTR patients.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brandon Smith:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Prothena completed a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study (NCT03336580). In the first report of clinical results with this depleter mechanism of action, PRX004 showed favorable results as demonstrated by slowing of neuropathy progression for all 7 evaluable patients at 9 months, including improvement in neuropathy in 3 of the 7 patients, and improved cardiac systolic function for all 7 patients. In this Phase 1 study, PRX004 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated across all dose levels. PRX004 was found to be safe and well-tolerated across all dose levels.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Furthermore, PRX004 has been shown in preclinical studies to promote the clearance of insoluble amyloid fibrils through antibody-mediated phagocytosis and inhibit amyloid formation. This depleter mechanism of action has the potential to provide benefit for ATTR patients at high risk for early mortality due to amyloid deposition in vital organs.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brandon Smith:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Prothena is integrating scientific insights and extensive experience around protein dysregulation to advance a pipeline of therapeutic candidates for several rare peripheral amyloid and neurodegenerative diseases. Our wholly-owned programs include birtamimab for the potential treatment of AL amyloidosis and a portfolio of programs for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. This includes our next-generation anti-Aß antibody PRX012 and dual Aß-tau vaccine being developed for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Our partnered programs include prasinezumab, which targets alpha-synuclein, in collaboration with Roche for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease, and programs that target tau (PRX005), TDP-43, and an undisclosed target in collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</em></p>

63705,PharmaShots Interview: Rain Therapeutic's Avanish Vellanki Shares Insight on the Initiation of P-III MANTRA Trial of Milademetan for Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Avanish Vellanki, CEO and Cofounder at Rain Therapeutics </strong>shared his views on the initiation of the P-III MANTRA trial to evaluate the safety &amp; efficacy of Milademetan for dedifferentiated liposarcoma and provide updates about the company's lead candidate, RAIN-32. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The company initiates P-III MANTRA trial to evaluate safety &amp; efficacy of milademetan vs trabectedin in a ratio (1:1) in 160 patients with unresectable or metastatic DD LPS with or without WD LPS that have progressed on one or more prior systematic therapies including at least 1 anthracycline-based therapy</li><li> The 1EPs of a trial is PFS, as assessed by blinded independent review &amp; 2EPs, include OS, ORR, DoR, DCE &amp; investigator-assessed PFS along with safety &amp; PRO’s</li><li> The company also provides patients update continuing to receive RAIN-32 as monothx. from the previously completed P-I dose-escalation &amp; expansion study. Additionally, the therapy has received FDA’s ODD for LPS</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>Discuss the design of the P-III MANTRA study for DDLPS.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>The MANTRA trial (NCT04979442) is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 registrational study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of milademetan compared to trabectedin, a current standard of care in patients with unresectable or metastatic de-differentiated (DD) liposarcoma (LPS) with or without a well-differentiated (WD) LPS component that has progressed on one or more prior systematic therapies, including at least one anthracycline-based therapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Approximately 160 patients are expected to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive milademetan &nbsp;or trabectedin. The primary objective of the trial is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review between the milademetan treatment arm and the trabectedin control arm. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, safety and patient-reported outcomes.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>What makes milademetan unique? Discuss it on behalf of its MoA and other features.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>Milademetan is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) which is oncogenic in numerous cancers. MDM2 is a critical regulator of tumor protein 53 (p53), also known as the “guardian of the genome” because it regulates the cell cycle and is therefore essential for tumor suppression. If MDM2 is overexpressed, p53 can be inactivated, leading to tumor growth and cancer progression. MDM2 inhibition by, milademetan may lead to the reactivation of p53, which can then resume its role in controlling cancer growth. In contrast to many prior generation MDM2 inhibitors, we believe milademetan does not exhibit material drug accumulation in tissues and therefore enabled an optimal dose schedule for efficacy and safety.&nbsp; We believe that a rationally designed dosing schedule in the prior clinical trial takes advantage of these properties of milademetan to demonstrate a potentially more favorable efficacy and safety versus competing for MDM2 programs.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Milademetan received U.S. Food and Drug Administration orphan drug designation for patients with LPS and has already demonstrated antitumor activity in an MDM2-amplified subtype of LPS and other solid tumors in Phase 1 clinical trial, potentially validating a rationally designed dosing schedule to mitigate safety concerns and widen the therapeutic window of MDM2 inhibition.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are your other plans with milademetan? Are you planning to explore its potential in other indications as well?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>In addition to the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating milademetan in patients with LPS, we anticipate exploring several other MDM2-dependent tumors as a monotherapy, as well as a multitude of tumors with wild-type p53 in combination with other agents, leveraging the safety profile of milademetan. In the near term, we plan to commence a Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in certain solid tumors in the second half of 2021 and a Phase 2 trial in intimal sarcoma by early 2022.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Share the details about DDLPS with our readers. Discuss its epidemiology and symptoms.</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>WD and DD LPS are two of the four subtypes comprising LPS, and together account for two-thirds of the overall LPS population.&nbsp; WD LPS is less aggressive and tends to be a large painless mass found in deeper tissues, however, DD LPS is more aggressive, arising from WD LPS, and is usually found in the tissue behind the abdominal area or the extremities. Both WD and DD LPS exhibit amplification of the MDM2 gene with nearly a 100% frequency, and hence are rational opportunities for treatment with MDM2 inhibition.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The incidence of LPS is estimated at approximately 3,000 patients annually in the U.S. for which there are few effective treatment options with WD and DD LPS comprising about two-thirds of the total LPS population.<sup>1</sup> While the symptoms of LPS depend on where the tumor is located, patients may at first notice a new or growing lump that may be painful.<sup>2</sup></em><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you feel competition in this space? If yes, who are they and how will milademetan create a difference with others?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>We believe we are leaders within the space given an ongoing Phase 3 pivotal study in DD LPS with an efficacy and safety profile from prior clinical studies that differentiate us from others.&nbsp; We believe milademetan could be the best-in-class MDM2 inhibitor. We intend to leverage the unique therapeutic window differences of milademetan versus the other programs by embarking on a broad and extensive clinical development program.&nbsp; We believe additional clinical studies will help to highlight the potential of milademetan across various MDM2-dependent and wildtype TP53 tumors.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What makes you work on precision medicine for patients suffering from cancer?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>The recent advancements in cancer research and drug development allow for an unprecedented degree of insight into the critical drivers of cancer growth and its associated signaling networks and vulnerabilities. Our vision is to help cancer patients live life to the fullest. To make this a reality, we have assembled a relentless team who is unshaken by obstacles, fiercely aware that someone needs us now, and is committed to harnessing tumor biology to develop vanguard therapies to treat patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Overall, the Rain strategy is aimed at giving patients and their families their lives back. Finding new targeted treatment options for these patients is the essence of our work and patients are our inspiration. Patients guide our development of new treatment options that have the potential to be not only more effective but also preserve the quality of life. It is our ultimate goal to provide patients with effective treatment options that are not characterized by the unwanted side effects that are so common with most cancer treatments.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you open to collaborations to offer precision therapies to more patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>We are always open to new collaborations to advance our precision oncology pipeline with partners that share our mission of developing and implementing innovative precision medicine strategies for patients suffering from cancer, and their families.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the company’s near-term plans? Share your achievements with our readers.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>In addition to the recent initiation of our Phase 3 MANTRA clinical trial, we recently provided an update from the Phase 1 dose-escalation</em> and expansion study evaluating milademetan across four-dose<em> schedules in patients with LPS, solid tumors or lymphomas.&nbsp;As of July 1, 2021, three WD/DD LPS patients received therapy with milademetan monotherapy for greater than 51 months. Further, we completed an initial public offering for Rain in April of this year that enables meaningful capital support to generate data for milademetan across a variety of MDM2-dependent tumor indications. We also plan to commence a Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in certain solid tumors in the second half of 2021 and a Phase 2 trial in intimal sarcoma by early 2022.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the MOA of RECCE 327.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James</strong><em>: RECCE 327 works through multiple mechanisms of action. Hydrophobic interactions with the polymer non-specifically attract and bind the antibiotic to proteins of the bacterial plasma membrane. Subsequent disruption of the bacterial cell wall and high internal pressure in bacterial cells leads to cell lysis. Importantly, non-bacterial cells remain intact since they do not contain high internal pressures.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>RECCE 327 quickly constrains bacterial cell energetics by shutting down ATP production, decreasing the pathogen’s ability to make proteins. RECCE 327 also depolarizes the microbe’s cellular membrane resulting in membrane destabilization, and higher concentrations – cell lysis.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Highlight the preclinical results supporting the antibacterial activity of RECCE 327 against MRSA.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James</strong><em>: Pre-clinical studies of RECCE 327 in topical burn wounds of rats showed significant antibacterial activity against MRSA, outperforming best-in-class antibiotic Soframycin. RECCE 327 reduced bacterial load and demonstrated dose-dependent wound healing activity Soframycin with repeated efficacy even in low doses.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are other anti-infectives in your pipeline?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James</strong><em>: Expanding upon our synthetic polymer technology, we have strengthened our anti-infective pipeline to include RECCE 435, a broad-spectrum synthetic polymer antibiotic formulated for oral use for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections, and RECCE 529, a synthetic polymer formulation for viral indications treatment of viruses having a lipid envelope or coat, examples being SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses, influenza viruses, HIV, hepatitis, ross river, and herpes viruses.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Which bacteria is the leading cause of infected burn wounds?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James</strong><em>: Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of wound infections globally, a challenging infection for physicians to effectively treat.</em>&nbsp;<em>MRSA is now one of the leading organisms causing invasive infection in burns across the world, with burn units reporting rates of infection greater than 50%. Furthermore, studies conducted in China, India, Pakistan, and the USA have highlighted MRSA isolates as highly susceptible to certain classes of antibiotics such as glycopeptide antibiotics, teicoplanin, and vancomycin – limiting the availability of therapeutic options for the treatment of infections in burn patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the ongoing clinical trials against the prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:</strong><em>&nbsp;Currently, Recce has two active clinical programs against prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>RECCE 327 is being evaluated in Phase I human clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of the compound via Intravenous (IV) infusion. RECCE 327’s primary indication is for sepsis, a life-threatening response to infection that spreads to the bloodstream. Many different bacteria including antibiotic-resistant strains can cause sepsis, making the disease extremely difficult to treat.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>RECCE 327 is also being evaluated as a topical solution in a Phase I/II human clinical trial in burn wound infections. The trial will assess RECCE 327 as a broad-spectrum antibiotic for patients with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial burn wound infections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What motivates you to work on difficult to treat bacterial and viral infections?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:&nbsp;</strong><em>The threats posed by global pandemics and epidemics are currently greater than at any other point in human history. Since the initial global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, which has claimed the lives of an estimated 4.2 million people worldwide, we have seen that the critical need for new therapies that help reduce the spread and mortality rate of bacterial and viral infections.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>At Recce, we are proud to pioneer the development and commercialization of a new class of synthetic anti-infectives designed to address urgent global health threats, treat a broad range of infections and minimize the risks posed by antimicrobial resistance.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you open to collaborations to advance your research and expand your pipeline?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:&nbsp;</strong><em>In addressing the urgent global health threat posed by antibiotic superbugs and emerging viral pathogens, time is key to developing new therapies which can be made available to health care professionals to treat patients. Recce is continuously looking for and welcomes new opportunities to advance or expand our anti-infective pipeline with partners that share our mission and sense of urgency to find solutions for unmet medical needs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the company’s strategy for working on anti-infectives addressing the global threat posed by superbugs and emerging viral pathogens.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:&nbsp;</strong><em>Recce is addressing the urgent global health threat by pioneering a new class of synthetic anti-infectives shown to be highly effective against the hypercellular mutation of a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without developing resistance – including the full suite of ESKAPE pathogens and their multi-drug resistant forms.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Recce’s new class of synthetic anti-infectives has demonstrated a world-first multi-faceted mechanism of action that kills bacteria and keeps on killing with repeated use as listed previously. New types of resistant mechanisms and multidrug-resistant bacteria continue to emerge and spread globally and with no new classes of antibiotics in over 30 years, existing drugs are succumbing to resistance, rendering them ineffective and unable to treat infections.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our pipeline aims to end the development hiatus and put a stop to this rapidly increasing threat. RECCE anti-infectives empower physicians with treatments that can be used repeatedly against both viruses and a broad range of bacteria including superbugs without contributing to drug resistance.&nbsp;</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What is Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> EoE is a progressive rare allergic disease characterized by difficulty swallowing and gastric reflux, as a result of elevated numbers of inflammatory immune cells in the esophagus wall. &nbsp;Roughly&nbsp;180,000 children and adults&nbsp;in the US have EoE,&nbsp;and up to 80% of patients have secondary allergic conditions. Early disease control is critical to avoid the thickening of the tissue of the esophagus.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>There are no FDA-approved drug products for EoE, and&nbsp;50,000 patients are unresponsive to available treatments, including long-term steroids. Patients may take proton pump inhibitors, but chronic frequent dosing often leads to poor compliance.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the MoA of 1104. How will this drug change the treatment landscape for EoE.?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> </em>‘<em>1104 is a peptide that was derived from a natural immune-regulatory protein,&nbsp;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&nbsp;Chaperonin 60.1, that plays a key role in immune system function.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In allergic diseases, such as EoE, the immune system “overreacts” to certain molecules (allergic antigens) that are unknown to the body. This results in the stimulation of inflammatory immune cells and molecules, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue destruction.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Most pharmaceutical solutions currently in use or in development focus on alleviating the overactive immune and inflammatory response after it starts, by targeting downstream processes and leaving many patients with unresolved symptoms.</em></p>

<p><em>&nbsp;‘1104 resets the immune response “upstream,” or ahead of the inflammatory cascade, stimulating the production of immune cells that regulate the inflammatory response, thereby preventing the immune system from entering overdrive.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>‘1104 has the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for EoE by providing long-term disease remission</em> while eliminating the risk of life-threatening immune suppression often seen with the <em>current standard of care.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the P-I results of 1104 that allow you to advance the program to the P-II study.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> ‘1104 has already been evaluated in two Phase 1 clinical trials. In the first Phase 1 placebo-controlled clinical trial, administration of ‘1104 intravenously and subcutaneously was safe at clinically relevant doses in 94 healthy volunteers and patients with mild asthma. A second Phase 1 multiple ascending dose studies in 18 healthy subjects found again that ‘1104 given intravenously was safe and tolerable also with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and served as the basis of the selection of the 8 mg dose for a subsequent Phase 2 EoE trial.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What motivates you to work on eosinophilic esophagitis?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> Until a few years ago, there was little awareness about eosinophilic disorders like EoE. There are no FDA-approved drug products for this debilitating disease and a significant number of patients are left to adapt their diet and take medications without a total response.&nbsp; Given the allergic nature of the disease</em> and the mechanism of action of ‘1104, we believe it has the potential to really change the treatment landscape for these patients and are excited to provide them with the first-ever<em> disease-modifying therapy. We look forward to advancing a Phase 2 trial before the end of the year.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Big leaders like GSK, Sanofi or Takeda are also working on EoE. Do you think Revolo’s 1104 can compete with its competitors?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> Absolutely. There are others working to develop a therapy for EoE, but what makes our therapy and approach different from all others is that our drug acts before the inflammatory response occur. We don’t focus on targeting individual inflammatory molecules such as cytokines that are produced after the inflammatory response has begun. ‘1104 may prevent the inflammatory response from ever starting, which could drive clinical improvement compared to the current standard of care.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How is the company revolutionizing autoimmune and allergic disease treatment?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We are revolutionizing autoimmune and allergic disease treatment by&nbsp;advancing therapies that may achieve superior long-term disease remission, require less frequent dosing, and avoid suppression of the immune system.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are the company’s clinical trial plans for this year and the coming years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We recently received approval of an investigational new drug application by the FDA to evaluate ‘1104 in a Phase 2 trial for EoE. We also received Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the UK to evaluate ‘1104 in a Phase 2 allergen sensitivity study. We expect to start enrolling in both studies shortly and anticipate providing updates before the end of next year.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are also advancing ‘1805, a modified analog of the endogenous binding immunoglobulin protein otherwise known as BiP, which is another key player in immune function. We anticipate initiating two Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating ‘1805, one&nbsp;for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and the other for non-infectious uveitis in the near term.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Given the agnostic nature of the mechanism of action of ‘1104 and ‘1805, we believe they have the potential to treat multiple allergic and autoimmune diseases, respectively and we continue to explore additional indications.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you open to collaborations to develop and commercialize your pipeline products?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We welcome collaborations with strategic partners who are looking to join us in drastically shifting the treatment landscape for allergic and autoimmune diseases. As we advance our clinical pipeline, we will consider every opportunity in order to bring treatments to patients in need as quickly as possible. We have identified many more additional indications for ‘1805 and ‘1104, and we are always willing to discuss partnerships as we explore the endless potential of these platform programs.</em></p>

63905,PharmaShots Interview: Saniona's Rami Levin Shares Insight on Tesomet for Hypothalamic Obesity,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Rami Levin, Chief Executive Officer at Saniona</strong> shared his views on the US FDA’s Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to Tesomet for the treatment of hypothalamic obesity (HO) and discuss its role in the company’s continued pipeline progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Saniona reported that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to Tesomet for the treatment of hypothalamic obesity (HO)</li><li>This milestone builds on the ODD granted by the FDA to Tesomet for the treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) in early 2021. Saniona is planning to initiate P-IIb studies of Tesomet in HO and PWS in H2’21</li><li>Tesomet is an investigational fixed-dose combination therapy of tesofensine (a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor) and metoprolol (a beta-1 selective blocker). It is the first and only investigational treatment for HO to receive ODD</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is HO? How is it impacting the lives of patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rami:</strong><em> Hypothalamic Obesity (HO) is a rare neuroendocrine disorder most caused by damage to the hypothalamus sustained during the removal of a craniopharyngioma, or CP, a rare, noncancerous central nervous system tumor. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for HO and there is no cure for this disease. Damage to the hypothalamus can cause severe dysregulation of energy homeostasis and, as a result, patients with HO often suffer rapid, excessive, and intractable weight gain, uncontrollable hunger, memory impairment, attention deficits, excessive daytime sleepiness and lethargy, issues with impulse control and depression. Patients with HO are also at increased risk of developing obesity-related comorbid conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and congestive heart failure.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is Tesomet? How will it be helpful in hypothalamic obesity (HO)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rami:</strong><em> Tesomet is an investigational fixed-dose combination therapy of tesofensine (a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor) and metoprolol (a beta-1 selective blocker). It is the first and only investigational treatment for HO to receive orphan drug designation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Tesofensine is a novel, proprietary molecule developed in the labs of our founding scientists. It is designed to block the reabsorption of serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine, which in turn reduces cravings for food, reduces appetite, and increases metabolic fat burn. We are currently preparing to initiate two Phase 2b studies of Tesomet in the second half of this year, one in HO and the other in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Please discuss the clinical study and its results supporting the US FDA’s ODD in HO for Tesomet.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rami:</strong><em> Saniona evaluated Tesomet in a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled initial Phase 2 trial in HO. Adults receiving Tesomet demonstrated statistically significant reductions in body weight and improvements in waist circumference and glycemic control. These improvements were maintained during an additional 24-week open-label extension. Tesomet was reported to be generally well-tolerated, and most adverse events were mild.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What does this designation mean to the company? What role does it play in the company’s continued pipeline progress?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rami:</strong><em> Saniona is proud to be pioneering a regulatory path forward for people living with HO, and we are thrilled to have received the first-ever FDA orphan drug designation in this indication.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Orphan drug designation is a special status granted by the FDA to medicines and biologics that are intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. The number of people living with HO is estimated to be between 10,000 and 25,000 in the U.S. and between 16,000 and 40,000 in Europe. Having this designation qualifies Saniona for certain development benefits, including tax credits, elimination of certain FDA license application fees, and seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S. following approval.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you planning for any caregiver and patient feedback programs for Tesomet?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rami:</strong><em> One of the key pillars of Saniona is our Patient Advocacy team, whose goal is to ensure patient and family voices help shape us from the start. We have already initiated multiple partnerships with the HO advocacy community to incorporate caregiver and patient feedback into the clinical trial process and to provide the community with education on clinical trials. For example, the HO community has been incredibly helpful in educating us on ways to ensure site visits during the clinical trial to provide an optimal patient experience.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: If approved, do you think it will be a boom for the patients suffering from this rare disease?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rami:</strong><em> HO places a tremendous burden on patients, caregivers and families. Not only does HO cause severe rapid, excessive, and intractable weight gain, uncontrollable hunger, memory impairment, attention deficits, excessive daytime sleepiness and lethargy, issues with impulse control and depression. Patients with HO are also at increased risk of developing obesity-related comorbid conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke and congestive heart failure. Orphan drug designation for Tesomet in HO is a critical step forward for Saniona and for this community, and we certainly hope a future approval would significantly improve the lives of patients and their families struggling with this disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What motivates you to work on rare diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rami:</strong><em> Personally, I have worked in rare diseases for many years, even before I became the CEO of Saniona. I have been struck by the tremendous unmet need in this area: there are an estimated 7,000 rare diseases, and less than 10% have FDA-approved treatments. Working to develop medicines for these communities provides you the opportunity to work closely with many families, to hear their stories and understand their experiences. It is incredibly motivating to be able to show them that someone cares about their journey and to provide them with hope.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss your pipeline targeting multiple rare diseases.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rami:</strong><em> In addition to Tesomet, which as I mentioned is advancing into Phase 2b clinical trials for HO and PWS, Saniona is a leader in the discovery of highly specific ion channel modulators. We have developed SAN711, which is in Phase 1 and may have applicability in treating neuropathic disorders, and SAN903, which is in preclinical development and may be applicable in treating rare inflammatory, fibrotic and hematological disorders. We are also advancing many earlier-stage discovery programs based on our ion channel expertise.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you planning to expand your rare disease portfolio? If yes, what would other targeted indications be?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rami:</strong><em> Our ion channel library consists of more than 20,000 proprietary ion channel modulators. We are confident that some of them will become new medicines, but it is premature to speculate about indications at this stage.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss your upcoming plans with our readers in terms of any regulatory submission, collaborations, and other details.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rami:</strong><em> We are currently focused on advancing Tesomet, SAN711 and SAN903. As I mentioned, Tesomet is entering Phase 2b trials this year for HO and PWS, SAN711 is in Phase 1, and SAN903 is in preclinical. We look forward to advancing these key programs while evaluating and selecting new programs emerging from our ion channel discovery engine.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laurent: </strong><em>&nbsp;In a pooled analysis of Phase 1 data from the AMEERA-1 study presented at the 2021 ASCO Annual Meeting, the investigational oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity, with an objective response rate of 34% and a clinical benefit rate of 74%. Amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib also demonstrated a favorable overall safety profile, with treatment related adverse events attributable to amcenestrant similar to those observed with monotherapy and without signs of significant cardiac or ocular side effects. [GCIH1]&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp; What role will these SERDs play in treating breast cancer and advancing the science behind the SERDs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laurent: </strong><em>&nbsp;A significant need exists for more treatment options for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for about 3/4 of all breast cancers diagnosed today. [GCIH2]&nbsp;As metastatic breast cancer patients progress through currently available treatment options, tumors become resistant – or stop responding – to treatment, and time spent on each therapy decreases, underscoring the need for new</em><a><em> </em></a><em>therapies and novel ways to overcome drug resistance.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Amcenestrant is an oral SERD that antagonizes and degrades the estrogen receptor (ER) resulting in inhibition of the ER signaling pathway. &nbsp;[GCIH4]&nbsp;We’re committed to responding to the unique needs of those living with ER+ metastatic breast cancer and investigating amcenestrant as a potential best-in-class oral endocrine backbone therapy across treatment lines through our broad clinical program.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp; What motivates Sanofi to work on the oral dosage of SERDs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Laurent: </strong><em>&nbsp;Over the years, healthcare providers have expressed frustration over the significant unmet needs in breast cancer.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The comprehensive development program for amcenestrant has been designed to evaluate its role: (1) as a single agent in second-line or later lines of treatment of ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, (2) in combination with palbociclib in the first-line treatment of ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, and (3) to explore its potential in early-stage breast cancer patients in the adjuvant setting. Late last year, the Phase 3 AMEERA-5 clinical trial investigating amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, as a first-line therapy for patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer, was initiated.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Put some light on the key features of the global in-licensing agreement with AstraZeneca? Can you disclose the details of the deal, such as upfront payment and all milestones?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Barbara:</strong>&nbsp;<em>In August, we announced an exclusive global in-licensing agreement with AstraZeneca for AZD5153, a potent and selective BRD4 BET inhibitor with a novel bivalent binding mode.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Through this deal, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 proof of concept study in the first half of 2022, which will examine our investigational JAK1/JAK2/ACVR1 inhibitor and lead compound, momelotinib, in combination with AZD5153 in patients with myelofibrosis (MF), a rare blood cancer.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay AstraZeneca an upfront payment of $8 million and certain pre-determined development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to $208 million. In addition, Sierra Oncology will provide tiered royalty payments based on future commercial success, ranging from high-single digits to low double-digits. We will be responsible for the initial Phase 2 trial execution and all future global development and commercialization activities.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is AZD5153? Why did you license AZD5153?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Barbara:</strong>&nbsp;<em>AZD5153 is a selective BRD4 BET inhibitor with a novel bivalent binding mode that inhibits both protein bromodomains, resulting in improved potency and more complete target inhibition.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>BET inhibitors have shown great potential in myelofibrosis and some other hematological indications.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>In addition, evidence suggests that inhibition of both JAK and BET pathways can result in the synergistic reduction of disease and overall improvement in the prognosis of MF. Preclinical and early clinical data suggest that AZD5153 is a differentiated BET inhibitor through its high potency, selectivity, and bivalent binding, which may offer more complete target inhibition relative to monovalent binders.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>With its favorable hematologic profile and potential benefits for myelosuppressive patients, momelotinib could become the cornerstone therapy of choice for combination regimens to treat myelofibrosis. We believe the combination of momelotinib with its differentiated mechanism and AZD5153 with its selectivity and potency may provide an efficacy and safety advantage over other JAK inhibitor plus BET inhibitor combinations and allow for prolonged dose intensity and treatment duration.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How will this licensing of AZD5153 be important to Sierra’s long-term strategy?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Barbara:</strong>&nbsp;<em>This global in-licensing deal brings another novel compound into our development pipeline, expanding our opportunity to deliver transformative therapies for patients with rare cancers. It also builds on momelotinib’s potential as a cornerstone therapy, allowing the opportunity to enhance and extend our ability to treat MF patients. Additionally, AZD5153 can also provide opportunities beyond myelofibrosis. Notably, there is a very strong preclinical rationale for the combination of AZD5153 with a Checkpoint 1 inhibitor, such as our SRA737, in several interesting indications.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you tell us about anemia in MF and the potential of momelotinib + AZD5153 in treating this class of patients?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Barbara:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Approximately 70-90% of MF patients have anemia at diagnosis, and some require regular transfusions. Furthermore, because anemia is progressive, virtually all patients with MF will eventually develop anemia and the vast majority will require regular transfusions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Unlike currently available JAK inhibitors, momelotinib is not only effective at managing spleen and symptoms, but it also may help improve anemia and reduce transfusions without exacerbating thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) -- and it is&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;myelosuppressive (decreases bone marrow activity).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Sierra believes that momelotinib in combination with AZD5153 may offer efficacy and safety advantages over currently available treatments for MF.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How do BET inhibitors affect the pathological cellular process in cell cycle control?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Barbara:</strong>&nbsp;<em>BET inhibitors can modify a range of pathological cellular processes, including the initiation and continuation of transcription and cell cycle control. In addition, BET inhibition may lead to decreased inflammatory cytokine release, anti-fibrotic activity, and reduced mutant cell proliferation, all of which would be indicative of disease-modifying effects in myelofibrosis. Several BET inhibitors, such as AZD5153, are under clinical investigation in multiple solid tumor and hematologic indications.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How could the combination regimen of momelotinib + AZD5153 offer an advantage over JAK inhibitors?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Barbara:</strong>&nbsp;<em>The combination of JAK inhibition and BET inhibition has been identified as a promising emergent approach for the treatment of MF. However, currently available JAK inhibitors are myelosuppressive, leaving a critical unmet need for patients with anemia or those at risk of developing treatment-emergent anemia. Given momelotinib’s unique mechanism as an inhibitor of ACVR1/ALK2 in addition to JAK1 and JAK2, it may be more easily combined with other agents, and it may provide unique benefits that aren’t achievable when BET inhibitors are combined with other JAK inhibitors, which is why Sierra is excited by the potential for improved outcomes for MF patients with this promising combination.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As we mentioned (Q2), we believe the combination of momelotinib and AZD5153 may provide an efficacy and safety advantage over other JAK inhibitor plus BET inhibitor combinations and allow for prolonged dose intensity and treatment duration.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Specifically, the combination of AZD5153’s bivalent binding mode with momelotinib’s differentiated profile may have the potential to deepen and prolong improvements in anemia, symptoms, and splenomegaly, and elicit disease-modifying activities, such as a reduction in bone marrow fibrosis and clonal proliferation. We also believe there could be synergistic NF-kB inhibition with the combination given some unpublished preclinical data.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When can we expect the availability of the product for patients with MF?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Barbara:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We plan to initiate a Phase 2 proof of concept study in the first half of 2022 which will examine momelotinib in combination with AZD5153 in patients with MF. This will inform a potential subsequent Phase 3 trial design. Specific timing beyond the planned Phase 2 study is not yet available.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How will this agreement help Sierra to expand its MF pipeline &amp; help patients suffering from this devastating disease? Are you open to more such collaborations?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Barbara<em>:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Our mission is to deliver differentiated, targeted therapies that treat rare forms of cancer, such as myelofibrosis. There’s a significant need for MF therapies that can modify the disease, impact the quality of life, provide treatment durability and extend survival. We believe the novel combination of momelotinib and AZD5153 may have the potential to provide clinical improvements in all these areas.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additionally, AZD5153 may allow us the opportunity to help patients beyond those living with myelofibrosis. Notably, there is the potential to combine AZD5153 with SRA737, our Checkpoint 1 inhibitor, in several different indications in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Agreements such as this one further our ability to identify, explore and advance the development of these therapies. We are open to and regularly evaluating additional collaborations that will help us transform the future of cancer care for patients with myelofibrosis and other rare cancers.</em></p>

64522,PharmaShots Interview: TFF's Dr. Dale Christensen Shares Insight on the Thin Film Freezing Technology,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Dr. Dale Christensen, Ph.D., Director of Clinical Development at TFF Pharmaceuticals</strong> shared his views on the preliminary data from the P-I trial of <strong>inhalable tacrolimus powder formulation</strong> for <strong>Lung Transplant &amp; its TFF technology</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>TFF has developed an inhalable tacrolimus powder formulation that can be delivered directly to the lung via an inhaler bypassing high systemic exposure</li><li>The preliminary data from the P-I trial demonstrated that inhaled tacrolimus powder achieves systemic therapeutic drug levels produced by TFF &amp; showed the same plasma levels compared to oral forms in low doses</li><li>The company focuses on lung-directed therapeutics by using its expertise in respiratory medicine and has the ability to transform drugs into an inhalable dry powder formulation that results in efficient &amp; targeted delivery</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is Thin Film Freezing or the TFF technology platform?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dale:&nbsp;</strong><em>Thin Film Freezing technology transforms drugs of all types – small molecules, biologics, and combinations, including those with poor solubility – into an engineered dry powder composition, that can be more than 95% active drug, for better efficacy, safety, and delivery.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Thin Film Freezing process involves applying a liquid solution of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and excipients, substances other than the drug that help deliver the medication to your system, over a cooled stainless-steel drum. When the solution contacts the super cold surface, it ?ash freezes, resulting in a frozen thin film. Solvents are removed from the frozen thin film by lyophilization, a process that removes the frozen solvent by passing it directly into a gas, thus leaving behind a dried composition known as a “Brittle Matrix Powder.” These dry powder formulations are room-temperature stable and can be used to deliver the drug via several routes: pulmonary, intranasal, topical, ocular, and parenteral.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Thin Film Freezing technology was licensed from The University of Texas at Austin, where it was developed by Robert (Bill) Williams, Ph.D., Professor and Division Head of the College of Pharmacy’s Molecular Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery Division and his research team. The technology was originally intended to improve the water solubility of poorly soluble compounds, but it was discovered to have important applications for inhalation delivery, particularly for delivering therapies directly to the lungs without the systemic toxicity frequently associated with oral delivery, while also improving therapy response time.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How can Thin Film Freezing be applied to lung transplants? What are the advantages?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dale:&nbsp;</strong><em>Our initial pipeline focus in lung-directed therapeutics leverages our profound expertise in respiratory medicine, and the ability of our platform to transform drugs into an inhalable dry powder formulation that results in efficient, targeted delivery.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Tacrolimus is currently only administered orally to prevent lung transplant rejection and is limited because only a low concentration makes it to the lung, where it is most needed. High doses of oral tacrolimus are administered to provide sufficient tacrolimus levels in the lungs for a therapeutic effect, and as a result, can cause systemic toxicity that often impacts the kidney.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To address this, TFF has developed an inhalable tacrolimus powder formulation that can be delivered directly to the lung via an inhaler, bypassing high systemic exposure and its associated adverse events while decreasing therapy response time for better efficacy. Direct delivery to the lung means less susceptibility for drug-drug interactions and may provide higher trough concentrations at lower total doses. This delivery method results in lower blood concentrations thus reducing adverse effects on the kidney, pancreas, and other organ systems.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the P-I data of the inhalable formulation of tacrolimus.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dale:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We recently&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://bit.ly/3rCCr2L"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>announced preliminary data</em></a><em>&nbsp;from our Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrating that inhaled tacrolimus powder achieves systemic therapeutic drug levels. We have completed patient enrollment in our Phase 1 study evaluating inhalable tacrolimus for immunosuppression maintenance in lung transplant patients and anticipate additional safety data in Q3 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The preliminary data show that inhaled tacrolimus produced by Thin Film Freezing is not associated with food effects, whereas oral administration decreases the rate and extent of absorption when taken with food. In the multiple ascending dose phase of the trial, data demonstrate that lower total doses of inhaled tacrolimus can achieve the same plasma levels compared to oral forms.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Single ascending dose evaluation in four cohorts of healthy subjects in a Phase 1 trial provided clinical evidence that inhaled tacrolimus produced by Thin Film Freezing was safe. The drug was well tolerated with no reports of clinically significant drug-associated adverse events, and a single dose provides substantial systemic blood levels that approach those associated with effective immunosuppression in heart, lung, kidney, and liver transplant patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the advantages of TFF technology?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dale:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Thin Film Freezing technology addresses many drug delivery limitations. The technology can be used to improve water solubility and absorption – an important drug delivery limitation. Poorly water-soluble drugs comprise approximately one-third of the WHO Essential Drugs List and an estimated 40 percent of all New Chemical Entities. The Thin Film Freezing technology can be used to provide engineered powders with excellent physical properties that facilitate dry powder aerosol administration. The technology can also be used to stabilize biologics, including vaccines, thus making them more commercially viable.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This technology can be used to produce high-potency powders that require minimal inactive ingredients, a benefit to drug development. The Thin Film Freezing platform also has the potential to prevent molecular damage due to temperature, air or water degradation, or damage from shear stress. The TFF process can be used to generate particles with improved solubility that can increase absorption and can produce materials in high yields and is scalable.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Additionally, TFF technology can successfully prepare dry powders of proteins and protein-containing products such as vaccines while maintaining their structure and functional activity, with good aerosol performance properties, and improved thermostability for potential ultra-cold chain-free storage. While other powder formulation techniques require the use of additional substances to improve the solubility of the protein, TFF technology does not rely upon a proprietary or exotic ingredient to increase solubility.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>TFF technology has limitless applications across a broad range of molecules, including biologics, with partnership opportunities to create technology-enriched products for better patient outcomes.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How will this technology support the stability and safety of future flu vaccines?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dale:</strong>&nbsp;<em>The TFF technology converts a vaccine and other biological products, which are traditionally delivered in liquid form, into powder. The powder state is typically more stable than the liquid state so flu vaccines would be able to be stored at temperatures that would support more widespread distribution and use of vaccines around the world. The safety of drugs formulated using the TFF technology has been tested in early clinical trials that were designed to test the safety of these drugs. These trials proved that the TFF technology can produce safe drugs, and we believe that we can improve vaccines by producing powders that can be delivered worldwide without ultra-cold chain storage requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Furthermore, we are investigating the delivery of vaccines as a dry powder directly to the mucosal surface in the lung and nose. Delivery of vaccines to mucosal surfaces could lead to the development of both the traditional IgG response and an IgA response. The IgA response produces a mucosal antibody that can provide enhanced protection at mucosal surfaces, like the lungs, to neutralize pathogens more rapidly at the site of exposure.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you think TFF technology could help overcome the logistical issues of current vaccines? How?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dale:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Peptides, proteins, and other biologics, including vaccines, are rapidly growing areas of the biopharma industry, but logistical challenges including the need for ultra-cold chain storage can limit distribution, especially in developing countries and rural America. We see an increasing need for alternative ways of delivering vaccines and other therapies to overcome roadblocks like cold chain storage and distribution – a need underscored during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our Thin Film Freezing technology allows us to develop dry powder formulations that are stable at room temperature even for an extended period and don’t require an extreme cold chain. We are continuing to pursue solutions to address COVID-19 and other infectious diseases as a near-term goal through our work with:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>UNION Therapeutics to develop a dry powder formulation of niclosamide, an oral therapy that has exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2</em></li><li><em>Augmenta Bioworks to develop a monoclonal antibody therapy which has demonstrated binding and neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 variants including the Delta variant in vitro</em></li><li><em>University of Georgia’s Center for Vaccines and Immunology, led by Ted Ross, Ph.D., Professor of Infectious Diseases, to develop universal influenza vaccines for pulmonary delivery</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In addition to the above partnerships, we also work with several pharma companies, academic institutions, and the government on applying Thin Film Freezing technology to COVID-19 vaccines and other infections. We are focused on partnering to enable the use of this technology in potential second-and third-generation COVID vaccines. In addition, we believe that Thin Film Freezing will also be applied to many other specific vaccines and platforms.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How is a Computationally Optimized Broadly Reactive Antigen (COBRA) approach being applied in the search for a universal flu vaccine?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dale:</strong>&nbsp;<em>The COBRA approach for developing broadly reactive vaccines utilizes multiple rounds of layered consensus building and sequence data from flu surveillance databases to generate influenza vaccine hemagglutinin (HA) immunogens. COBRA HA antigens are capable of eliciting potent, broadly reactive HA-specific antibody responses that can protect against both seasonal and pandemic influenza strains that have undergone genetic drift. The TFF process allows protein vaccines to be more stable and longer-lasting than their liquid counterparts. Our partners at the University of Georgia, led by Dr. Ted Ross, tested the immunogenicity and efficacy of universal TFF HA vaccines and found that effectiveness was retained following the Thin Film Freezing process.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How are researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine developing recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vaccines to address SARS-CoV-2?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dale:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We are collaborating with Dr. Kartik Chandran from the Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine to develop a Thin Film Freezing formulation of SARS-CoV-2 specific rVSV to treat COVID-19. They are applying the Thin Film Freezing technology to multiple potential rVSV candidates, having generated more than 60 rVSVs bearing spikes from many virus families to date. rVSVs have allowed the rapid identification and down-selection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Preclinical results show rVSV-SARS2 protects hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge via multiple routes. The next step is to determine if fragile membrane-enveloped VSV particles survive freezing.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How can one investigate high biocontainment (BSL-3 and BSL-4) viral pathogens safely and efficiently?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dale:</strong>&nbsp;<em>We exploit the modular nature of viral entry apparatus to genetically and functionally transplant it onto an innocuous virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What motivates you to develop dry powder formulations of tacrolimus and vaccines for infectious diseases?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dale:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Today, many drugs intended for lung conditions are only administered orally due to properties that make them ill-suited for direct delivery to the lungs. Administration by the oral route typically results in only about 10% of the drug reaching the lungs, and these drugs may cause unwanted and even deadly side effects when dosed to achieve therapeutic lung levels. We believe that our Thin Film Freezing platform for the first time will allow many of these medications to be formulated into the convenient, direct-to-lung dry powder inhaler format providing delivery of the drug directly to the target site.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Our technology is potentially game-changing with broad applicability to transforming drugs into dry powder formulations that can be delivered via multiple routes. We believe it has high-value opportunities and is partnering with academic, pharma, and government agencies to advance programs across our pipeline.</em></p>

<p><strong>BMS Partnership:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>What are the key points for this license agreement for use of Xtend XmAb technology in Sars-Cov-2 by Xencor and Bristol Myers?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Dahiyat:</strong><em> We provided Bristol Myers Squibb with non-exclusive access to our Xtend Fc technology, with the hope it will help extend the circulating half-lives of the antibodies used in their novel combination therapy being evaluated to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus for treatment or prevention of COVID-19.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Bristol Myers Squibb is responsible for clinical development, regulatory activities, and potential commercialization, and we are eligible to receive royalties from net sales of products developed with our Xtend Fc technology.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>How does the Xencor XmAb Fc technology work?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Dahiyat:</strong><em> Our XmAb Xtend Fc domains increase binding affinity to the receptor FcRn, which is present inside lysosomes in endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and functions to rescue antibodies from the degradation that makes most proteins short-lived in circulation. As a result of interactions with FcRn, all antibodies have half-lives ranging from a few days to a few weeks, allowing less frequent dosing for antibody drugs than most other biologics. We have engineered a series of variants that increase binding of the Fc domain to FcRn to keep antibodies from being degraded, which in turn increases circulating half-life.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sotrovimab EUA:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>How will Sotrovimab, an XmAb engineered antibody developed by Vir biotechnology and GSK, be used in emergency cases for covid patients? What will this antibody do? Please lets us know the mechanism and how it will work in emergency cases.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Dahiyat:</strong><em> It’s important to understand that Xencor’s XmAb Fc domains are designed to be modular and thus can be used in a plug-and-play manner whenever we—or our partners—engineer drug candidates to have the enhanced property, like extended circulating half-life. As with Bristol Myers Squibb’s duo antibody combination, Vir Biotechnology, and GSK’s sotrovimab also incorporates our Xtend Fc technology. And not unlike our collaboration with BMS, Vir and GSK—not Xencor—are responsible for all development and commercialization. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Preclinical data suggest sotrovimab has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1, the virus that causes SARS, indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The FDA’s letter of authorization and fact sheet, which outline the use of sotrovimab under its U.S. emergency use authorization, can be found online at sotrovimab.com.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>  <strong>When are Vir and GSK evaluating Sotrovimab in further clinical development?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Dahiyat:</strong><em> </em><em>Vir and GSK are evaluating sotrovimab in an extensive ongoing clinical development program. Additional studies include COMET-PEAK, a pharmacokinetic study in outpatients with mid-to-moderate COVID-19 investigating intramuscular administration of sotrovimab; COMET-TAIL, a Phase 3 study evaluating intramuscular administered sotrovimab for the early treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk non-hospitalized adult and pediatric patients of at least 12 years of age; and a prophylaxis study in uninfected immunocompromised adults.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As the clinical development continues, Vir and GSK have announced that they are working with government agencies around the world to make sotrovimab available to patients in need of treatment.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> “<strong>Xtend has demonstrated, in multiple antibodies and through numerous human clinical trials, the ability to extend antibody-drug half-life and reduce dosing frequency in patients, an important feature in anti-viral therapy for pandemic use.” Can you please shed some light on this statement, provide additional color?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Dahiyat:</strong><em> Xtend technology is additionally in multiple clinical-stage programs and one approved therapy, Alexion’s Ultomiris (ravulizumab-cwvz). Antibodies with extended half-lives stay circulating in the bloodstream longer, meaning patients may not need to take them as often. In a pandemic this is especially important as it reduces the number of times patients receive the medication as each dose works for a longer period, and given potential manufacturing constraints, more patients can receive the medicine. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>How does Xencor’s Xtend XmAb technology in Sotrovimab</strong> <strong>reduce the risk of hospitalization or death in high-risk outpatients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Dahiyat:</strong><em> As previously mentioned, Vir and GSK’s sotrovimab incorporates our XmAb Xtend Fc technology. Recently, they announced final, confirmatory results from the Phase 3 COMET-ICE trial demonstrating that sotrovimab reduced the risk of hospitalization or death among high-risk adult outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, compared to placebo. Xtend reduces the number of times patients receive the medication as each dose works for a longer period.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>It’s interesting to note that data from in vitro studies, published online, have demonstrated that sotrovimab maintains activity against circulating variants of concern and interest, including the Delta variant. </em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong>  <strong>What phase was the trial when it was submitted for EUA? Is Sotrovimab</strong> <strong>being evaluated in additional clinical programs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Dahiyat:</strong><em> The U.S. FDA granted a EUA for sotrovimab based on interim data from Vir and GSK’s Phase 3 trial, COMET-ICE. They are evaluating sotrovimab in an extensive ongoing clinical development program.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>Tell us about the key features of data on phase 3 COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial).</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Dahiyat:</strong><em> </em><em>Vir and GSK recently announced final, confirmatory results from the study demonstrating that sotrovimab significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization or death among high-risk adult outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The primary efficacy analysis of all 1,057 patients in the trial demonstrated a 79% reduction (adjusted relative risk reduction) (p&lt;0.001) in hospitalization for more than 24 hours or death due to any cause, by Day 29 compared to placebo, meeting the primary endpoint of the trial. The number of patients in the trial who were hospitalized for more than 24 hours for acute management of any illness or death from any cause at Day 29 was six patients in the sotrovimab arm (1%) versus 30 patients in the placebo arm (6%).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In the safety analysis, 1,037 participants were followed through at least 29 days. The most common adverse events observed in the sotrovimab treatment group in COMET-ICE were rash (1%) and diarrhea (2%), all of which were mild or moderate. No other treatment-emergent adverse events were reported at a higher rate with sotrovimab compared to placebo.</em></p>

54342,ViewPoints Article: 3D Bioprinting Represents a Huge Leap in the Pharmaceutical Industry,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three-dimensional technology has been an integral part of the pharmaceutical industry for many years. The medical fraternity has witnessed the clinical benefits of 3D technology such as printed anatomical prostheses, heart valves, biological tissues, hearing aids, and much more. The global 3D printed drugs market was valued at US$ 29 million in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2020 to 2027. The factors driving the 3D printed drugs market growth include the increased delivery of personalized medicines, extensive research, and development activities. Its application in the manufacturing of drugs is very attractive since it caters to personalized medicine. With extensive research and progress in cell biology, nanotechnology, and material sciences, a new concept has surfaced, <strong>3D Bioprinting.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is 3D Bioprinting?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3D bioprinting, a novel technology, is basically a manufacturing process to generate tissue-like structures that behave as natural tissues. The simplest bio-printed tissue is a single layer, like skin. The ingredients are “biomaterials” i.e. cells and growth factors. A key difference between 3D printing and 3D bioprinting is that a living cell suspension is used in the case of bioprinting rather than thermoplastic, used in the conventional 3D printing method. The cells are usually extracted from the patient or if not possible, adult stem cells are used which are then cultured carefully and converted to “bio-ink” which by its name, prints the desired tissue or organ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How is 3D Bioprinting done?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""type"":""1""} -->
<ol type=""1""><li>3D Imaging:&nbsp;A standard imaging (CT or MRI scan) is done to get the exact dimensions of the tissue/organ.</li><li>3D Modeling: A mode / blueprint of the organ/tissue is created by using AutoCAD software to avoid the transfer of defects.</li><li>Bioink Preparation: it is the combination of the patient`s living cells, compatible basin (gelatin, collagen, etc.) and cell growth factors based.</li><li>Printing: Deposition of the prepared bioink Layer-by-layer on the AutoCAD design.</li><li>Solidification: Solidifying the structure may be aided by using specific chemicals, UV light, or heat.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why 3D Bioprint?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main objective of bioprinting would be to provide an alternative to autologous and allogeneic tissue implants. In the coming time, it will gradually replace animal testing and thereby speed-up the drug development process. The long term objective is to deliver personalized tissues/organ made from the patient`s own cells. It would hypothetically have fewer rejection rates. Who would be the owner of that organ? This could be an ethical challenge to ponder upon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A small, yet powerful step would be the creation of tissue components for the heart, liver, pancreas, and other vital organs. &nbsp;In the future, 3D bioprinting will make organs widely available to those who need them, instead of being on a transplant list for many years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""type"":""1""} -->
<ol type=""1""><li>Reduce research and development costs by replacing animal testing.</li><li>Testing a drug`s efficacy on a fully bioprinted organ/tissue before invitro or human study.</li><li>It could solve the current organ transplant waiting list problem.</li><li>Customized training materials could be deployed in medical colleges to help train students and physicians.</li><li>Accurate cell distribution</li><li>High-resolution cell deposition</li><li>Scalability</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""type"":""1""} -->
<ol type=""1""><li>There is limited availability of good quality data. This could be due to a lack of interest by the pharmaceutical development researchers, high costs incurred upon the company, and less information on bioinks.</li><li>Strict regulations</li><li>Cost-estimation is difficult</li><li>Reimbursements</li><li>Tissue-specific bioink</li><li>Improve current 3D Bioprinters to enhance resolution and detailing</li><li>Large scale production</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The future of 3D bioprinting is bright for the pharmaceutical industry due to the trend of more personalized medical treatments. The increasing demand for customized therapeutics will help the 3D bioprinting industry is emerging. It would become possible to 3D print tissues and even organs, which would make a lot of lives happier and healthier. In the coming years, 3D bioprinting could even help repair a damaged liver. A bioprinted liver patch created from the patient`s own liver cells could be the solution. Finally, 3D bioprinting represents a huge leap forward from animal testing and cell culture.</p>

<p><em><strong>Authored by Frank Nestle, Global Head of Research and Chief Scientific Officer, Sanofi</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past few decades, progress in understanding the molecular drivers of disease has revealed exciting new opportunities for targeting common and complex conditions in the fields of Immunology, Oncology, Neurology, and Rare Diseases. At Sanofi, we are going beyond incremental therapeutic improvements building on the wealth of molecular disease insights combined with novel and proprietary technology platforms to discover and deliver transformative medicines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Progress does not happen overnight — we've been carefully building out our portfolio of innovative biomolecular platforms over several years, to empower our scientists and drug hunters with the tools they need to engineer sophisticated solutions to seemingly intractable medical problems. I'm particularly excited about the potential the following five technologies hold for patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><u><strong>1. Expanded Genetic Alphabet: Using synthetic biology to develop novel protein therapeutics</strong></u></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":64754,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-64754""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sanofi’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZlc-tPoFH0&amp;t=96s"">Expanded Genetic Alphabet</a> technology adds two letters to the existing four letters of the genetic alphabet, allowing our scientists to engineer new proteins with highly specific attributes. This empowers our teams to overcome long-standing challenges in drug design and fills important gaps in protein-based therapeutics for cancer and immune-mediated diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This platform has already yielded an immuno-oncology drug candidate, SAR 245/THOR-707, which addresses a well-known limitation of the cytokine drug IL-2. Introducing a novel amino acid into the IL-2 protein and attaching a PEG at a specific site has made it possible for this investigational therapy to increase the numbers of tumor-killing T effector cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells in cancer patients – without significant expansion of potentially immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. SAR245 is just a first example of a whole new generation of sophisticated and highly engineered protein therapeutics that exploits progress in synthetic biology to design medicines with unprecedented efficacy and safety features.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sanofi’s proprietary <a href=""https://www.kymab.com/technology/intelliselect/"">IntelliSelect Transgenics platform</a> is one of the most advanced human-antibody generation platforms. It applies advanced single-cell technology and bioinformatics to help our teams generate fully human monoclonal antibodies that are highly specific to their target and minimizes untoward immune reactions against antibody-based medicines. One therapeutic candidate that has already been produced using this technology binds to a protein called OX40-ligand, a key inflammatory master regulator expressed on immune cells, making it a promising target for treating a range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><u><strong>3. NANOBODY technology: next-generation single domain antibody technologies that facilitate binding to multiple targets at once</strong></u></em></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nanobody proteins are approximately 1/10 of the size of a normal antibody, highly modular, and bind with high affinity to their targets. Through the creation of a “string of pearls” of Nanobody proteins, we can target multiple disease components with a single medicine. Nanobody proteins can also be engineered as bi-specific binders to connect a tumor and a T cell or NK cell for instance. Our NANOBODY technology allows us to develop single, multi-action medicines that could one day replace complex combination treatment regimens and improve treatment outcomes and quality of life for patients. The first approved Nanobody drug that targets the von Willebrand factor is a first-in-class treatment for acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, making a difference for patients suffering from this acute and potentially life-threatening disease.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Natural Killer (NK) cells have the innate ability to detect and destroy cancer cells and help trigger a broader adaptive and protective anti-cancer immune response, all without attacking the body's own healthy cells. This has major implications for minimizing toxicity associated with many of the currently available cancer cell therapies. Sanofi's proprietary NK-cell platform expands and activates NK cells derived from a unique universal donor pool using our PM21 particle technology. It enables our teams to move on from costly individualized cell therapies and develop ""off-the-shelf"" immunotherapies that provide potential future access to a wider range of cancer patients.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a powerful cancer treatment, but its impact has been limited by a complex treatment procedure: patient cells must be extracted from each individual patient, amplified in the laboratory, genetically reprogrammed, and then re-infused. As demonstrated in pre-clinical experiments, our scientists use proprietary nanoparticle technology to deliver therapeutic mRNA directly to a patient's immune cells where it can reprogram those cells into CAR T cells in the patient’s body to detect and destroy cancer cells more effectively. This approach may be a gateway to expanding Sanofi's capabilities in both immuno-oncology and inflammatory diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sanofi's toolkit of proprietary technology platforms brings our teams several steps closer to developing transformative medicines for patients with difficult-to-treat diseases. Our goal is to offer a whole new class of treatments that could make patients' lives better and fundamentally change how clinicians approach cancer and immune disorders.</p>

<p><strong>Ginger</strong> has anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects, which can be effective in the treatment of COVID-19 symptoms.&nbsp; Other functional foods such as honey have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant characteristics. Honey comprises enzymes, vitamins, phenolic acids, amino acids, flavonoids, and minerals. Broccoli sprouts have antioxidant activity, which is helpful in downregulating virus RNA level and manage the infection. <sup>2</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Glutathione: </strong>The anti-inflammatory effects of the master antioxidant of reduced glutathione (GSH) are exerted through the inhibition of ACE activity, decrease of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and reduction of NF-kB activation. The balance ACE/ACE2 is shifted toward ACE by the oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG) and by renin (the circled arrows pointing upwards indicate the induction of ACE) and by viral infection. A trial of 2 g of PO or IV glutathione was used in two Covid-19 patients that improved their dyspnea within 1 h of use. Repeated use of both 2000 mg of PO and IV glutathione was effective in further relieving respiratory symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Astaxanthin: </strong>It has a strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action. Astaxanthin acts with the role of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) in the initiation of interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE), attenuating the pathway would play a crucial role in avoiding the inflammation in COVID-19.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Curcumin: </strong>It is the active ingredient of Turmeric that has anti-inflammatory activities. Curcumin has shown clinical evidence as an effective agent for the treatment of COVID-19. <sup>4</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrographis paniculate: </strong>The active ingredient is andrographolide and it has a potent inhibitory effect against COVID-19. Andrographolide binds with spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and acts as a prophylactic agent for limiting viral entry into the host cells. <sup>5</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To summarize, nutraceuticals have paved the way for the management of COVID-19 infection. They may be beneficial as supportive therapy. Multiple nutraceuticals have already proved their activity against viral infections and other species of coronaviruses. Only a few nutraceuticals have been clinically studied in Covid-19. They may be beneficial in reducing the severity of illness. Further research and good quality clinical trials need to be conducted. Clinical data regarding efficacy and safety will help physicians in clinical decision-making.</p>

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p><em><u>With the race to develop an effective vaccine becoming intense, how has the coronavirus pandemic changed the pharmaceutical industry, and what can we expect in the long- and short-term? Let's see….</u></em></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The year 2020, and the new decade as a whole, has definitely got off to the worst possible start – and we have a pandemic to blame for that. Since planting its roots in China right at the end of 2019, the coronavirus has blazed its trail across every continent, every country, and left hundreds of thousands dead, and many more fighting for their lives. Worse still, it has created a level of fear and anxiousness among citizens that have never been seen before, with their fears of contracting the disease being compounded by economic uncertainties. However, at the end of it, whenever that will be, the world is expected to turn up stronger and more aware. This cannot be truer than in the medical and pharmaceutical settings, which have become synonymous with the pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pharmaceutical sector is being looked up to as the savior of mankind, what with the number of drugs and vaccines that have been proposed and put into trial by major manufacturers. In fact, the pandemic has brought the world closer in this regard, enabling industry leaders to supply critical medicines across borders, strengthen the supply chain, as well as ensure workforce safety, all this while adhering to governmental norms and restrictions. We will now see how ‘The New Normal’ will look in the context of this sector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Companies are expected to face numerous disruptions in the coming months in the context of supply chain and logistics, as well as workforce disruptions in the form of acquiring new skillsets and redistribution of talent. Companies are also expected to reconsider and re-evaluate their partnerships with contract manufacturing organizations in order to mitigate cost risks, while there will also be intensive considerations as to the requirement of excess capacity, along with geographic expansion and diversification.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The importance of transparency in the realm of risk mitigation will have a big say in the growth and utilization of digital and analytics tools. The full automation of facilities is expected to become a major point to ponder over for business leaders, as a way to avoid disruptions for any similar extended circumstances in the future. Additionally, the use of agile models will become critical in expediting processes such as quality checking, validation, and approval of new medical equipment or material, in case of any future emergencies.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The readiness of major companies to come together for developing an answer to the pandemic is expected to continue in the long run. Organizations such as GSK, Sanofi, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Pfizer, among others, have understood the delicate scenario and have pooled in their resources in order to accelerate the drug and vaccine development. GSK and Sanofi joined forces in April to develop a vaccine, and have very recently started testing their protein-based vaccine on humans for the first time.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>GSK has also partnered with the University of Queensland in Australia with the objective of early vaccine development. ‘Coopetition’ is expected to gain more mileage in the coming years, as companies experience the advantages of combining their expertise and knowledge, even though a bit of competitiveness would still be at play. The coming years, thus, can be expected to see a continuation in the collaborative nature between the trinity of the industry, academia, and the government. Case in point – more than 12 organizations, which include Gilead (USA), Novartis (Switzerland), and WuXi AppTec (China) have been conducting tests and sharing their knowledge regarding treatments, as well as clinical trial designs.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In continuation of the above point, the pandemic has seen testing and early diagnosis become of paramount importance to combat COVID-19, with the US FDA has issued norms and regulations that allowed for earlier than the usual implementation of diagnostic tests. In due time, relaxations were also made with regards to clinical trials, imaging modifications, ventilators, and food labeling rules, which have had a positive impact on the development of the pharmaceutical industry.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>More recently, the FDA also relaxed norms regarding viral transport media, which would effectively handle the dwindling supplies. It is to be noted that these measures and developments are there for the short term and that these norms and regulations would be tightened again, once the pandemic goes away, whenever that is. However, pharmaceutical companies are expected to remain busy in the coming months, especially since a sure-shot vaccine is still at a nascent stage.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Virtual clinical trials have been a very promising concept as complementary to physical trials. The pandemic is expected to result in more awareness about this system, which hopefully will translate to widespread adoption. With stay-at-home orders expected to be in place for quite some time, companies have put paid to hopes of conducting in-person trials; however, with telemedicine gaining huge popularity among consumers, industry players have made significant changes to their trial models, with a survey by ERT in May showing that 82% of the respondents are already on this path. As they say, the future is virtual!</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>mRNA technology has witnessed rapid acceptance in the pharmaceutical community, with McKinsey noting in April 2020 that approximately 80% of the pharma companies predicted strong growth for mRNA and other technologies in the coming months and years. The same could be the scenario for conventional biologics-drug-substance capacity, which is expected to be repurposed for supporting the fight against COVID-19.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pandemic has severely stressed the healthcare industry, but as we see in the above points, there are many opportunities for companies to shine in this scenario, and there are uncountable more areas that will be explored in the coming months by companies that have not been touched upon here. Here’s hoping that adversity brings out the best in the industry!</p>

<p><strong>‘Remote Patient Monitoring’ Among the Key Benefits Offered by Telemedicine Services</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Telemedicine allows medical examination and consultation of patients residing almost anywhere in the world. With minimal operational pre-requisites, telemedicine services offer massive benefits such as improved efficiency, faster diagnosis, precise medication, and consultation. Remote patient monitoring is one of the primary benefits of telemedicine. Through video-enabled platforms, doctors or related personnel can interact with the patient residing almost anywhere in the world. Concepts such as constant monitoring and updates allow more frequent consultation. Patients do not necessarily have to travel long distances again and again. These benefits save a huge amount of time and money, which would have been much higher in cases of hospital visits. Patients who are bed-ridden and physically disabled can benefit hugely from remote patient monitoring. As a result, telemedicine services are gaining more popularity in the coming years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hesitancy is the Main Reason Behind the Surge in Telemedicine Use During Covid-19 Pandemic</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The coronavirus outbreak has created a sense of urgency and panic among people across the world. While people are understandably being advised to stay indoors, healthcare professionals and researchers have registered a state of urgency. Nonetheless, people are becoming hesitant to consult doctors for normal consultation at clinics and hospitals, mostly due to the contagious nature of the disease. Yet again, technology has delivered the answer to a human obstacle. The advent of telemedicine has helped consumers consult doctors through video communication apps. Through telemedicine, doctors can prescribe medicines and other remedies through the comfort of his home. While the pandemic is set to last for a while, companies are targeting this sector for short-term business plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides remote patient monitoring, telemedicine possesses several other benefits. The main reason behind the rise of the telemedicine industry is the flexibility and comfort that it offers. The advances in telemedicine largely favor the geriatric population. Additionally, people who cannot afford services such as hospital visits, high costs of in-hospital stays, and on-the-stop doctor consultation will also contribute to the growing popularity of telemedicine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A few of the other benefits offered by telemedicine includes:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Reimbursement policies</li><li>Flexibility in scheduling doctor consultation</li><li>Improved access to care</li><li>Reduced administrative tasks</li><li>Patient tracking and monitoring</li><li>Cases of natural disasters</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Telemedicine Holds Massive Potential in Disaster Management</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The use of telemedicine is not just limited to bed-ridden patients. Events such as natural disasters hold a huge potential for telemedicine and telemedicine consultation services. In cases of floods, earthquakes, and other disasters, it is difficult for people to travel to the hospital or even consult doctors in clinics, for that matter. Moreover, natural disasters such as tsunamis leave people exposed to viral diseases. The chances of epidemics are higher during these events. In such cases, telemedicine can help people avail of medical services at the comfort of their homes and avoid outdoor hospital visits. This helps in reducing the risks associated with infections and epidemic diseases. With technology at the fore of several telemedicine services, there is a significant rise in the efficacies associated with these services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>As Telemedicine Are Gaining Popularity, Diverse Healthcare Markets to Open Up</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As telemedicine is growing in popularity, investors are likely to hover around. Telemedicine will open up several markets in the healthcare industry, pertaining to nurses, insurers, therapists, and physicians. The advances in technologies, backing from governments, high investment, and a growing R&amp;D emphasis will all contribute to the development of telemedicine in the forthcoming years.</p>

<p>In late 2019, a mysterious virus causing infection consisting of dry cough, fever tiredness, and last pneumonia first appeared in Wuhan, China. The world health organization (WHO) named the disease as Coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19). Interestingly, Covid-19 and flu (caused by influenza virus) share the common disease progression asymptomatic (no symptoms), mild symptoms fever or chills, body ache, cough, fatigue, headache, and pneumonia (fluid in the lungs). The only difference between them is shortness of breath and loss of taste and smell that appears in Covid-19 [1].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several risk factors that contribute to severe illness may include but are not restricted to, old age, and underlying medical ailments which include respiratory disorders, asthma, heart conditions, diabetes, and a weak immune system. When the body trying to fight the infection, the immune system may go into overdrive and cause excessive immune response leading to complications and ultimately acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1].</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Symptomatic treatment for Covid-19</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A patient with mild symptoms can be managed at home and treating symptoms symptomatically. The patient should be isolated in a separate room and monitored for breathlessness.</p>

<p><strong><u>Drug Therapies Undergoing Clinical Trials</u></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As no conclusive therapy is available for clinical management of COVID-19, existing drugs are being repurposed for treatment. The drugs used for treatment are based on three approaches: drugs that affect the virus’s ability to enter inside the host cell, drugs that interfere with host immunity, and the use of antibodies. Currently, various drugs are prescribed for symptomatic management of disease (Table 1) [2].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Antiviral drugs:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Remdesivir</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remdesivir (GS-5734; Gilead Sciences, Inc)&nbsp;is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug approved by US-FDA under emergency use authorization (EUA) for severe COVID-19 hospitalized cases. Two pharma companies, Cipla and Hetero introduced remdesivir (licensed from Gilead Sciences) in India under the brand name “CIPREMI” and “COVIFOR” for emergency use of a drug in the country. Also, the Cadila healthcare of India has launched a lyophilized Remdesivir injection (100 mg) in August 2020 [3, 4].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Favipiravir</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Favipiravir, another patented antiviral drug (tested on Ebola infection) of Gilead Sciences, has been approved as EUA for treatment of COVID-19 infection is mild to moderate condition. The drug selectively blocks the enzyme responsible for the multiplication of the virus. Japan and the USA conducted phase 3 and phase 2 clinical trials of favipiravir in COVID-19 patients. Glenmark Pharma (India) announced the results of the Phase-3 clinical trial conducted on mild to moderate patients who were administered with a favipiravir tablet. The results showed 28.6% faster virus clearance in overall participants and 69.8% of patients achieved clinical cure on day 4. Currently, different brands such as “Covihalt” (Lupin), “PiFLU” (FDC), and “Avigen” (Dr. Reddys) are launched in India [5, 6].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tocilizumab</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the progression of COVID-19 from severe to critical condition, the body produces an excessive amount of proinflammatory cytokines (cytokine release syndrome) which leads to ARDS followed by shock and multiple organ failure. Therefore, to rescue sever patient Tocilizumab is approved by US-FDA for cytokine release syndrome. India approved the use of Actemra (Tocilizumab) injection only for certain COVID-19 cases [7]. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Itolizumab</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In July 2020, Biocon Ltd. received the Drugs Controller General of India’s node for emergency use of Itolizumab (ALZUMAb®) injection for the treatment of CRS and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19. Itolizumab, which was launched in 2013 as an anti-CD6 IgG1 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis repurposed in severe COVID-19 complications. Currently, dexamethasone is under phase 3 and phase 4 trial for the treatment of hypoxia and respiratory distress syndrome.&nbsp; Also, IV infusion of itolizumab is in phase 2 trial for the treatment of complications associated with Covid-19. [8].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dexamethasone</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dexamethasone (corticosteroid) showed improved recovery rate and reduced death by one third in the UK recovery trial among hospitalized patients. The drug acts by dampening the body’s immune response which becomes too aggressive, produce cytokines and damages own body cells in many terminally ill Covid-19 patients. In June 2020, the Health Ministry of India added dexamethasone as an alternative to methylprednisolone in moderate to severe cases. Currently, the Intranasal administration of Dexamethasone is in phase 2 clinical trial as an adjuvant in Covid-19 patients [9].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Supplementary therapy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Micronutrient such as Vitamins and trace elements (Vitamin D, Vitamin C &amp; zinc) plays a crucial role in developing and maintenance of immunity system of the body. Supplementation of vitamins and trace elements in Covid-19 treatment found to beneficial in improving clinical outcomes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zinc (daily intake 8 to 11 mg/day) is necessary for the maintenance of innate and adaptive immunity as increased intracellular concentration helps in impairment of virus replication and thereby prevents multiplication. Currently, various clinical trials of zinc supplementation along with other treatment option is in phase 4 and phase 2 stage [10, 11].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daily supplementation with vitamin D (daily intake 2000 IU/day) and vitamin C (daily intake 200mg/day) reduce the risk of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. A clinical trial involving hydroxychloroquine treatment with vitamin supplementation for the prevention of Covid-19 symptoms is in phase 2 [12].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Antibiotics - Azithromycin, Ivermectin</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antibiotics such as azithromycin and ivermectin are found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic drug that displayed its efficacy against SARS-CoV2 during in vitro study. It acts by blocking the nuclear import of viral and host proteins thereby preventing viral replication inside the host.&nbsp; Another drug, azithromycin (macrolide antibiotics) displayed therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV2 viral pneumonia in a study performed by the New Mexico University research group. However clinical trials need to be conducted on azithromycin as it can act as prophylactic in a declining rate of infection [13].&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hydroxycholoroquine</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the initial phase, US-FDA, EMA, or other regulatory approved drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. On 22<sup>nd</sup> March 2020, the Indian council of medical research association (ICMR) recommended hydroxychloroquine as prophylactic for asymptomatic health care workers and an asymptomatic patient who came in contact with laboratory-confirmed patients of COVID-19. Furthermore, the FDA granted the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 on March 28, 2020. However, FDA discontinued use on July 4, 2020, as it shows little or no effect on patient mortality during the trial. Both drugs block the entry of the virus by interfering with receptors present in the body for SARS-CoV-2. However, prophylactic studies of these anti-malarial drugs show benefits but they are not conclusive [14, 15].&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Convalescent Plasma (CP) Therapy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The convalescent plasma therapy or passive antibody therapy was used first time in the treatment of the Spanish influenza pandemic that appeared from 1918 to 1920.&nbsp; Therapy involves the collection of CP from previously infected patients in order to transfer antibodies to protect or treat humans from infection. After the outbreak of SARS-CoV2, researchers and healthcare professionals started searching for the possibility of CP therapy in infection. During the trial, CP has shown limited and moderate success and can be used as a short term solution for the suppression of the mortality rate. In March 2020, US-FDA approved the use of CP therapy in severe infection. Maharashtra government has launched convalescent plasma therapy-cum-trial project for treatment of critical COVID-19 in which severe patients will receive two doses of 200 ml of convalescent plasma free of cost [16].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Future Direction:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different drug targets are presently under investigation for the treatment of Covid-19. Immunity against the virus is a major focus in these studies as the immune system helps us to fight against different viral infections. Various drugs that can improve our immunity in the Covid-19 condition are in clinical trials. Nivolumab, an anticancer drug, is in phase 2 investigation for its efficacy in adaptive immunity. Another drug, Sargramostim, is investigated for stimulating antiviral immunity action in Covid-19 and is currently in phase 2. Drugs Isotretinoin, which is used in different skin conditions is in phase 3 clinical trial for its immunity-boosting action in body. The mixture of Hesperidin and Diosmin, which improve host immunity against the virus is presently in phase 1. Apart from this, some herbal drugs such as Nigella sativa (phase 2 and 3), Ayurvedic kadha, Colchicine (phase 2), Caesalpinia spinosa (phase 2 &amp; 3) are also being evaluated in clinical trials for their action against Covid-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As no specific treatment or vaccine is available for COVID-19, only symptomatic management of using antiviral drugs, immunomodulators, or plasma therapy is used by healthcare professionals. Preventions will help us to break the infection chain of the virus. To protect ourselves and family from COVID-19 wear a mask, clean your hands properly using soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizers, don’t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you have a fever, cough, or difficulty in breathing consult your doctors. “Wear a mask, stay home and save lives”.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past seven months, the global pandemic caused by the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that leads to coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has impacted the global economy and people's lives tremendously. A number of countries and companies have concentrated their resources to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 and considering the present scenario, one can be hopeful to have a vaccine available soon. However, finding the vaccine is just the first step. Other critical steps that every government should be thinking about in relation to their national vaccine strategy are product integrity and safety, public education, and the actual distribution program itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Product integrity and safety tests that assure the vaccine is safe to use, communication programs that inspire public confidence, and a robust supply chain management strategy that anticipates local demand efficiently which will deliver a vaccination program that the general population is willing to participate in. Since the sense of urgency is critical, governments all over the world should start planning based on these important enablers. Without this planning, the goal of having a confident and vaccinated population ready to return to “normality” and participating fully in the economy will not become a reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday 11th of August, Vladimir Putin announced the first vaccine to the world, named Sputnik V. With this announcement the race to get a working vaccine to people all over the world has heated up further between key players all over the world eager to cash in on this opportunity for financial and political reasons. One thing is clear, whichever vaccine makes it to commercialization the supply chain will play an integral part in the upstream manufacturing supply chain and the downstream distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Demand for the Vaccine</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many experts around the world are expecting the introduction of these vaccines to cause major challenges to global supply chains in manufacturing, transportation, and distribution as companies scramble to meet demand from countries all over the world. The demand for this vaccine will be at a historic high. Never in the world before has there been a situation where a vaccine needs to go out to the whole world at the same time. With a global population of more than 8 billion people, this will be more than a mammoth undertaking.</p>

<p><strong>Upstream Manufacturing Supply Chain</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""align"":""left""} -->
<p class=""has-text-align-left""><p>To get to making a vaccine, there are several manufacturing steps that need to be taken which although invisible to most people are critical in the time path to a final drug product. These include making and testing the API product which forms the active ingredient of the drug. Making the actual drug itself (drug substance), the filling process involved in turning the bulk drug substance into usable vials or syringes for vaccination. The other needed parts related to the syringe itself, the needle, the vial, the cap, the label, etc. The last step is the actual final labeling and packaging of the vials into the finished product. In the pharmaceutical industry, all these manufacturing steps are usually performed at different factories often across different countries in the world. Synchronizing these production steps and the availability of all the components, the ingredients, and manufacturing capacity, as well as the logistics between the various factories all, create potential bottlenecks and risks.</p></p>

<p><strong>Procurement of Vaccines – Access Rights &nbsp;</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Governments around the world are competing to get first access to available vaccines. They are faced with critical questions around which vaccine brand to back now to secure access to large quantities to be able to start domestic immunization programs. Backing a vaccine and paying upfront for access and guaranteeing certain quantities of doses whilst there is no advance guarantee the vaccine will work is a large financial and political risk only the richer countries are able to make. The US, clusters of countries in Europe, and some other richer nations are making these types of advanced access agreements with key manufacturers. These funds help finance the manufacturing work already started whilst the vaccines are still being developed and tested for approval.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although it is good that some of the richer nations have stepped up to help pre-finance these vaccine programs it presents a real moral dilemma once the vaccines are approved in terms of which countries get first access rights and which ones do not. Given the share volume of vaccines that need to be produced to cover the whole global population the difference between being a “first mover” country versus a “last mover” could be as long as 3-5 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other words, countries with more money will buy priority access to vaccine programs whilst emerging countries will not be able to do so financially. It will mean that as the world moves out of the COVID-19 lockdown phase, clusters of countries can do so more easily than others. It will create a further disparity between regions around the world economically which potentially poses new socio-economic and (geo) political risks.</p>

<p><strong>Downstream Supply Chain </strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once a vaccine has been produced it is ready to be shipped under heavily regulated and temperature-controlled conditions to countries around the world. Many industry experts predict this enormous logistics task will lead to huge capacity problems for airlines and logistics companies. Laurent Foetisch, Supply Chain Management Consultant as Supply Chain Operations with more than 35 years of pharmaceutical manufacturing and logistics experience argues differently. “It is not possible to produce the quantities of vaccines needed all at once. Typically, vaccines are produced in batches of around 100,000 – 150’000 vials/syringes based on a daily production cycle. Even if multiple filling lines are used across various manufacturing locations it is not possible to produce all the vaccines immediately at these numbers in millions for everyone”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This also means that the “big bang” launch theory of a vaccine might not be as big as many predict. It would mean that availability of vaccines for distribution is spread over a longer time frame which from a capacity perspective is less complicated to manage by logistics companies and airlines. Rather than a “bulk” shipment program, it could well turn more into a “Just in Time” shipment program feeding into domestic immunization programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there are other factors to think about as the first batches of vaccines are released and shipped. Eelco Dijkstra, Managing Partner at Europhia Consulting points out that ensuring product security across the entire supply chain will be vital. Not just in terms of establishing and using validated temperature-controlled transport and storage solutions but also in terms of risks such as the product being “highjacked” and/or “counterfeited” by organized crime as the product is transported across multiple countries.</p>

<p><strong>National Vaccination Program - The Final Mile Distribution</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;The two major challenges of the government-run vaccination program on a national level would be in public education and in the distribution program itself. To make any vaccination program successful, it is vital to plan on how to educate the end community to ensure that the public is fully aware prepared to take the vaccination timely and efficiently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talking about the distribution strategy, the key questions that need to be addressed include how to best manage any vaccination program. The biggest first question for governments to address is whether a vaccine will be made mandatory for the whole population or be voluntary? Who will receive vaccination first? Vulnerable groups first such as people with a medical condition or the elderly? Will governments use hospitals throughout the country for people to come to and get vaccinated or will government look to use more points of vaccination such as medical clinics including private ones?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In some countries it will make sense to use existing COVID-19 infrastructure such as dedicated clinics and testing centers already in place. In some cases, it might make sense to set up “mobile” vaccine units which come to elderly homes, local community centres and schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Vaccines are pharmaceutical drugs and will need tight temperature and security control during storage and transportation. Given the share size of any vaccination program based on population size, it will run into the millions of vaccinations for which an end to end distribution model will need to be designed, tested, and executed in a very short period of time. Therefore, the timing for the planning for such a distribution model cannot start soon enough. For any vaccination program to be successful, the distribution part will be critical. Therefore, any national distribution plan linked to a country’s vaccination program will need to involve partnerships between government and private companies in logistics and distribution to plan and execute. We are already working with several governments on these initiatives providing input on strategic and tactical elements of such distribution plans.</p>

53559,ViewPoints Article: Digital Biomarkers,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Healthcare industry is going through a technological revolution and it is vital for the industry to work on new technologies that will help to generate, collect &amp; track novel data. The availability of large data makes the system becomes important to convert it into appropriate information which will helps industry researchers, clinicians, doctors, entrepreneurs, consumers to understand health and disease. Digital biomarkers provide an opportunity to interpret new data into informative &amp; actionable insights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Biomarkers are characteristics (physiologic &amp; pathologic) that can be objectively assessed and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological process, pathogenic process, or pharmacological response to therapeutic alteration inside the body. Digital biomarkers help in the collection of physiological &amp; behavioral measures of the consumer using digital tools that can be used to explain &amp; predict health-related outcomes. These outcomes can differ by the means of disease explanations to the prediction of drug response thereby influencing the fitness behavior of a person.</p>

<p class=""has-text-align-center""><strong>Figure 1: The role of digital biomarkers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recent years companies such as Fitbit, Misfit, Jawbone, Apple health, MocaCare, Skeeper, etc which are into tracking sleep, fitness, blood pressure, etc. are growing fast. These companies become a substantial player in health &amp; wellness, which are generating significant data not only about patients but also about individuals not on patient care. As per Market &amp; Market data, the global marketplace for medical wearable devices is estimated to reach $12 billion by 2021. As these data-generating devices rise exponentially, the health care data also shows an astronomical growth rate. Patient-generated data using digital biomarkers provide new information in the healthcare industry.<sup>1</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>TYPES OF DIGITAL BIOMARKERS:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital biomarkers can be classified depending on the status of a particular measurement to a particular clinical outcome. Digital biomarker either replace non-digital biomarker (known as Approved), opens a new arena (Novel) or is a fusion/hybrid which on one hand substitute and on other hand unlocks new field (original).<sup>1</sup></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CURRENT APPLICATION OF DIGITAL BIOMARKERS:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital biomarkers can provide objective measurement which supports the diagnosis, prognosis, and measure therapeutic based outcomes. Currently, major pharma companies are running pilot studies to evaluate the feasibility of digital biomarker use. Roche has developed a Parkinson's disease app to measure PD severity. Biogen in partnership with PatientsLikeMe developing an app to measure the physical activity of patients with multiple sclerosis whereas Neurotrack remotely assessed the cognitive ability of Alzheimer’s patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outcome measures by using digital biomarkers in a clinical trial are limited but growing fast due to their precision &amp; reliability. Recent years have observed the application of digital biomarkers in health areas such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders, diabetes, neuropsychiatric disease, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""type"":""1""} -->
<ol type=""1""><li><strong>Cardiovascular disease</strong>: Companies have engaged in the detection of atrial fibrillation for cardiovascular disease using algorithms based on smartwatch data. FDA has not approved algorithm-based data, but a digital biomarker for atrial fibrillation detection is available in conjunction with an approved EKG. Similarly, the study published in The New England Journal showed the use of accelerometer as the primary outcome measure in the treatment of congestive heart failure.2</li><li>Sleep: Due to less validation requirement, a variety of digital biomarkers such as Fitbit’s sleep stages feature, MI Fit’ sleep score is commercially available. A study published in the journal Sleep in 2017, investigated the ability of wrist-worn tracker to estimate sleep stages in a normal adult. The result of the study demonstrated that the use of these devices can be used to track stages of sleep with reasonable accuracy in normal adults. These devices can simplify sleep research and will help to increase public awareness about sleep issues.3</li><li>Respiratory Disorders: Smart inhalers for asthma and COPD consist of sensors that are attached to inhalers and monitor the use of medication. An objective assessment of inhaler adherence determined by obtaining the date, time &amp; number of device actuation. These smart inhalers are Bluetooth-enabled and linked wirelessly with computers, tablets, or smartphones for automatic data transfer from inhalers. The companion mobile application gathers, interprets data &amp; sends processed information to the healthcare professional. One of such FDA-approved applications developed by Propeller health known as Propeller health system which identifies the environmental triggers for patients with asthma, COPD &amp; other respiratory conditions. It includes a sensor attached to a rescue inhaler or to a controller inhaler medication for effective management of the condition.4 Teva, another pharma company also launched FDA approved smart inhaler, Digihaler device in 2019 in the respiratory portfolio.5</li><li>Diabetes: Diabetes is one of the major metabolic disorder which affect the large population worldwide. It always remained a highly innovative area in terms of digital therapeutics for pharma companies. San Francisco based company Omada Health; brought evidence-based digital therapeutics in the area of pre-diabetes/diabetes. The company offers a special online diabetes prevention program known as “Prevention” in association with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) which provides information regarding how diet and exercise reduce the chances of developing diabetes. During the program, each participant received a wireless digital scale and pedometer and interact with a personal health coach for daily feedback using an online platform. Results showed that participants lost 4.7% more body weight than an average weight loss of 2.4% for personal diabetes prevention programs.6 Merck &amp; amazon partnership announced they are aiming to develop voice-enabled solutions for people with diabetes using Amazon’s Echo dot &amp; Alexa.7</li><li>Neuropsychiatric Disease: Different research programs are under progress in the area of neuropsychiatric disease. Researchers started examining wearables, accelerometers, and smartwatch devices in adults with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Roche has developed a Parkinson disease application to capture voice-related information for obtaining early symptoms associated with Parkinson's. Application collect voice data on phone &amp; calculate stability when user hold devices.<sup>8</sup></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neurotrack developed digital online test for detection of cognitive deficit in Alzheimer’s patient. The test is inexpensive &amp; have potential of easy to use approach for detection of Alzheimer before development of clinical symptom. The test assessment are takes repeatedly so that user can track how memory changes over the time.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p><strong>CHALLENGES TO BE OVERCOME IN NEAR FUTURE<sup>10</sup></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""type"":""1""} -->
<ol type=""1""><li><strong>Standardized solutions: </strong>To compare &amp; evaluate the results obtained during the studies by using digital biomarkers, standardized solutions are needed. During clinical trials, the use of standardized procedures ensures similar sampling in every case and therefore results are comparable with another achievement. In the case of consumer-generated data, it is not evident. The measurement carried out by smartwatches or trackers could be completely different in each situation.</li><li><strong>Reliability</strong>: As not all digital biomarkers are FDA or CE approved, the reliability of the instrument is questionable.</li><li><strong>Measurement issue: </strong>The measurement details can be entirely distinct as individuals can measure (for eg ECG) with different tools at home.</li><li><strong>Privacy or regulatory issue:</strong> Ensuring privacy and autonomy is of prime importance as digital biomarkers send measured data directly to the company or researcher. The data use agreement for digital biomarker should be thoroughly followed and must be monitored by government authority.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Continuous monitoring of healthy as well as diseased persons using digital biomarkers will bring new data to a healthcare professional on regular basis. In the past, many incidences occurred where the use of new technology leads to a paradigm shift in the medical field which enabled new questions and novel insights in the healthcare system. The use of digital biomarkers will not cause a shift in the medical paradigm but it will offer novel ways for the measurement of health status which provides observations and perspectives into a disease that were unavailable before. Digital biomarkers will help to provide supplementary information &amp; augment conclusions obtained from traditional biomarkers. The detailed measurement along with accurate &amp; precise evaluation from molecular characterization of the disease using digital biomarkers will help to redefine diagnosis and classification of disease. The molecular profiling of disease with the help of digital biomarker can further support precision medicine &amp; leads to innovative treatment in different disease. Finally, digital biomarkers not only provide information about what we know about the disease but also about understanding of their own health. &nbsp;</p>

36266,ViewPoints Article: Digital Revolution in Healthcare and Strategic Role of Medical Affairs Amidst Covid-19 Outbreak,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Medical Affairs</strong> is a critical scientific bridge between Healthcare companies and their internal &amp; external stakeholders. It plays a leadership role in implementing cutting-edge medical, scientific, and patient-centered insights &amp; solutions that drive strategy and innovation in healthcare. The healthcare ecosystem is dynamic and being transformed with the latest tech solutions. It is believed that in the coming decade, all healthcare companies will leverage available data and technology solutions to boost productivity and efficiency. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the current scenario of <strong>Covid-19</strong>, getting appropriate healthcare is a challenge. The visit to the outpatient department has a great risk of exposure to the virus. Patients must decide between a high-risk clinician visit and postponing needed care. Digital innovation and solutions can help to address these current limitations in the healthcare delivery system. In an endeavor to tackle this disruption, the health care system is attempting to transition to <strong>“telemedicine”</strong> by unfolding the capabilities of digital technology. ICMR has allowed telemedicine amidst this pandemic. In 2019 there were <strong>560 million internet users</strong> in India.&nbsp; The high volume of patient load (millions) on a few trained doctors in telemedicine may burden the whole system and reduce its efficiency. Effective digital platforms are the need of the hour.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A large digital medical platform is essential to keep up with growing need of healthcare. It would also solve one of the biggest challenges faced by patients, that is getting adequate time with the doctor to properly understand the disease and medicines prescribed.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Affairs Role in Stakeholder Engagement &amp; Impact of Digital technology</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patients and HCPs being the primary <strong>Stakeholder</strong> engage the qualified medical affairs teams for up-to-date and systematic information in an innovative way.&nbsp; Medical Affairs has always been responsible for engaging key opinion leaders (KOL) and other stakeholders. But, now it enables <strong>“Stakeholder experience perspective”</strong>, that is to deliver what the stakeholder wants, when and how they’d like to receive it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The 3 key areas are:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1.&nbsp; Delivering exceptional customer experience focused on science</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Seamless connection of our digital medical information assets with external digital channel</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Use of AI models and ML technologies to enrich and expand the utility of real world evidence</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The growing importance of Medical Affairs' role with <strong>Real-World Data</strong> further cements the need for digital tools to capture and analyze this amount of data and identify trends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Advancement in Medical Insights Capabilities by Digital Innovation</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collection and analysis of unstructured data to identify the current trend of unmet medical needs can create a powerful “digital medical insights engine. This will influence customer engagement and strategic decisions. Since data is the pre-requisite for analysis, the sources of data for medical affairs should be made clear.

62599,ViewPoints Article: Ethno-Pharma- An Emerging Sector,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Healthcare sector in 2021 is evolving to a greater extent owing to the initiatives and advancements taking place to futureproof the healthcare facilities from uncertain, unwanted, and deadly events like Covid-19. These advancements are happening while keeping the patients at the center with more focus on preventive and immune health. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now while talking about preventive immune health, we can see at large, traditional medicines and integrative medicinal practices are emerging in the modern scenario of healthcare. Ethno-pharma, an ethnomedicinal field, which majorly deals with traditional and folk medicines is also set to boom in upcoming years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While focusing on the cultural determinants for traditional medicines and also pharmaceuticals, ethno-pharma deals with the investigational approaches in finding the possible use/perception of traditional medicines (and also pharmaceuticals) in the culture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ethno-pharma and ethnopharmacology follow the ‘multidisciplinary scientific approach’ through which various holistic approaches can be made to innovate novel treatment strategies for the management of various chronic diseases and to explore their relevance to modern healthcare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>India is widely known as the ‘home to medicinal herbs’ as traditional and integrative medicines are well-accepted and established in the country. However, the concept of ethno-pharma is yet to establish in India as a very small cluster of the population is aware of this field. Following are some promising approaches that can put light on the ethno-pharma sector in India in the coming years.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>New Research and Progressions in the field of Herbals&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Traditional medicinal plants contain a wide variety of chemical groups which exert different biological effects through which several chronic diseases can be cured in a natural way. As ethnopharmacology majorly deals with the pharmacognostic, phytochemical, and pharmacological aspects of natural drugs and medicinal plants, looking at the current advancements in Indian research and development, some promising novel herbal drugs can be invented in the years ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, to develop new molecules which are safe as well as affordable, a number of pharmaceutical companies are showing rejuvenated interest in natural drugs. Covid-19 and the increased prevalence of lifestyle diseases and non-communicable diseases have led down a rigid platform for herbal drugs which in turn boosting the research and development in the area at 2× speed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Changing Attitudes, Driving Markets</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides Pharmaceuticals and Chemically derived entities, most of the consumers due to awareness are looking for natural medicines. Pharmaceutical medicines have their own place in curing patients and through vaccines, even preventing certain diseases, however, the movement towards natural products and ethnopharmaceuticals has a social impact besides medical impact. Due to this, a great market transformation can be seen in the herbal and natural ingredients area.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indian traditional medicines market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.06% through INR 300 billion in 2018 and can account for INR 710.87 billion by 2024. This market growth can be beneficial in increasing the evidence-based research in the area of ethnomedicines. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Government Bodies Supporting Traditional Knowledge</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayurveda and Homeopathy medicines covered under the AYUSH system of medicines have a strong correlation with ethnopharmacology as the field is associated with traditional medicines to a greater extent. Owing to this, the Ministry of AYUSH is taking several efforts to involve the ethnopharmacology model in the syllabus of alternative medicine systems. Due to such approaches, an individual subject can also be expected in the syllabus of AYUSH which can further propel the growth of the ethnomedicinal sector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AYUSH initiatives to boost the immune health in Covid-19 through traditional remedies have emerged as an uplifting factor for natural medicines and further advancement in this area by the major companies like Dabar, Patanjali, Baidyanath, Himalaya, etc. are opening the doors wide open for the future astonishing growth in the herbal field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, Society for Ethnopharmacology (SFE) in India is working with the reputed academicians, researchers, and industry dignitaries with the goal of ‘Globalization of local knowledge and localizing global technologies. This society can be of great benefit in spreading the knowledge of traditional ethnomedicines to stabilize the ethno-pharma sector in the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To effectively march toward the healthy future of the Indian population and the economy, the ethnomedicinal sector should be well equipped with technological advancements like the pharmaceutical industry. Scientific-evidence-based approaches for herbs, herbal products, ethno-herbal extracts are important which will drive this field much effectively and it can become more approachable for modern healthcare practices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with all these, quality control and quality assurance are the key parameters that major herbal products fail to follow as compared to pharmaceuticals. Certain policies in this area can also help to develop the natural sector in much flawless and productive manner.</p>

35548,ViewPoints Article: How Will the MedTech Industry Navigate The COVID-19 Impact?,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>COVID-19 has casted the healthcare community into disarray. Healthcare providers are stressed as the disease has affected more people than the production capacity of healthcare companies to manufacture ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) and diagnostic kits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since Business disruptions have happened, business continuity strategies are in operation. The medical technology (Medtech) industry is moving swiftly to combat the pandemic but remains flexible and dynamic to respond to the alarming situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MedTech industry is developing risk-based plans and gearing up for immediate actions to be taken, such as marketing authorizations that may be needed to apply for life-saving products, as well as long-term supply issues. The respiratory devices market is witnessing a surge in demands on a global level, resulting from the rising necessity of ventilators due to uncontrollable rising of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the increasing prevalence of respiratory diseases, the global ventilators market is expected to grow&nbsp;manifold and the industry is upgrading for the demand. Furthermore, the entire respiratory market will continue to grow with the high incidence of chronic diseases, such as COPD and asthma among the increasing geriatric population.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How MedTech industry is <strong>managing</strong>  the development in COVID-19 scenario?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process of device development is dynamic, iterative and requires innovation in &amp; out of the box thinking to overcome technical and logistical hurdles, whether navigating the restrictions of COVID-19 or not. Several development methodologies exist, that helps to structure activities and drive efforts towards a common objective and, even within a tightly regulated field, agile and nimble techniques need to be implemented.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the COVID-19 era, device development groups must initially proceed with robust and explicit procedures to maintain development deadlines and reduce risk when engaging in user testing programs. User testing will continue with a different set of priorities and greater restrictive professional guidelines. The use of digital technology will be crucial in this scenario.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The medical devices industry in India consists of large multinationals, with extensive service networks, as well as small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Indian companies are focusing on producing masks, ventilators, and diagnostic test kits. They will have to gear up for this challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Five steps for MedTech to navigate the Covid-19 Impact:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong><em>Impact on demand:</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elective procedures have decreased significantly and the decrease in demand for devices used in these procedures. Hospitals visits by patients are postponed and rescheduled. Consequently, MedTech companies have seen a decrease in demand for products related to procedures such as Bariatric surgery, joint replacements, and other implantable devices. Also, there is an increased demand for devices like ventilators, PPE, and diagnostic kits. There will be a realignment of devices demand in the near term. MedTech companies need to be agile and ready to respond to robust demand for services and products once situation normalizes. Portfolio optimization will be critical.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. <em>Supply chain:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Supply chain has been disrupted and will take a significant time to reverse the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Application of newer technologies like 3D printing at site can help in several critical implants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This could help keep the supply chain dynamic. Probably, a valve for a ventilator could be printed at a hospital rather than having to be delivered by the manufacturer.&nbsp;The MedTech industry could also help develop products and technologies that allow certain procedures to be undertaken in office settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. <em>Adopting Digital Technology:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Procedural training and operation theatres procedural support and product training are critical in the device industry. MedTech companies need to rapidly embrace these newer technological solutions to deliver the value of their products and services. New product interventions will have to be done by innovative technology platforms. Tele mentoring will be a critical tool to support clinical and non-clinical stakeholders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong><em>Digital clinical tools:</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital platforms for generating and evaluating evidence are important to evaluate effectiveness and safety outcomes. Digital platforms in combination interoperable data, real-world evidence (RWE), and data analytics will make it easier to monitor the performance of a product through its entire lifecycle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. <em>Artificial intelligence, Digital/virtual care:</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use of AI models and ML technologies to enrich and expand the utility of services and products and procedures are going to be seen widely. Robotics and AR will have wider applications. Healthcare ecosystem will adopt virtual health/telemedicine, this will help hospitals, health systems, and clinicians make the most effective use of resources and minimize unnecessary exposure of patients and caregivers to diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Regulatory Scenario COVID-19 Impact&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to play a critical role in the multifaceted all-of-government response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes, facilitating medical countermeasures to treat and prevent the disease, and checking the medical product and food supply chains for potential shortages or disruptions and helping to mitigate such impacts, as necessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
