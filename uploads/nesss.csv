<img class=""size-large wp-image-9277 aligncenter"" src=""http://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PR-1024x531.png"" alt="""" width=""747"" height=""387"" />
Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance and commercial launch for the SelectSite(TM) C304-HIS deflectable catheter system for use in procedures involving His-bundle pacing (HBP).
The SelectSite C304-HIS deflectable catheter system features a deflectable, out-of-plane curve to reach the bundle of His and is designed to enable enhanced range maneuverability, fixation and implant success for a wider range of patient anatomies. Its adjustable form helps accommodate and secure the pacing lead in more challenging anatomies, including patients with a large right atrium.
""Pacing at the bundle of His is a promising procedure with a growing body of clinical evidence,"" said Pugazhendhi Vijayaraman, M.D., director of electrophysiology at Geisinger Heart Institute in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. ""The C304-HIS catheter's adjustable curve design should help implanters reach the His bundle fibers more easily and accommodate a variety of patient anatomies.""
The new catheter system facilitates placement of the Medtronic SelectSecure(TM) MRI SureScan(TM) Model 3830 cardiac pacing lead, the only pacing lead on the U.S. market approved for HBP. His-bundle pacing is a physiologic alternative to right ventricular pacing, in which a pacing lead is placed at or near the bundle of His, using the heart's native His-Purkinje conduction system to restore the heart's normal rhythm.
""There is a growing trend of physicians interested in His-bundle pacing for certain patients as it leverages the native conduction system,"" said Rob Kowal, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer, vice president of medical affairs in the Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. ""Medtronic is pleased to continue to lead the industry with product innovations and training to support this emerging therapy technique.""

<span class=""xn-location"">ARITAN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">May 29, 2019</span>  -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced the publication of data from the randomized, open-label <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2479378-1&amp;h=2076132170&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT02252172&amp;a=Phase+3+MAIA+(MMY3008)"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Phase 3 MAIA (MMY3008)</a> study that showed DARZALEX® (daratumumab) plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) resulted in a significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).1 These data were published <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2479378-1&amp;h=3158562426&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa1817249%3Fquery%3Dfeatured_home&amp;a=today"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">today</a> in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>.
""We continue to see scientific evidence through Phase 3 studies that support the use of daratumumab in combination with standard of care regimens,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Thierry Facon</span>, M.D., Service des Maladies du Sang, Hôpital Claude Huriez, <span class=""xn-location"">Lille, France</span>, MAIA investigator and author of the study. ""As multiple myeloma can become more complex at each relapse, it is important to select an optimal upfront therapy. Results from the MAIA study suggest that this daratumumab combination therapy should be considered for patients with multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible upon diagnosis.""
Results from the MAIA study demonstrated that at a median follow-up of 28 months, DARZALEX, in combination with Rd, reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 44 percent in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for ASCT, compared to treatment with Rd alone (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.56; 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-0.73; p&lt;0.001).1 The median PFS for DARZALEX-Rd has not yet been reached, compared to 31.9 months for patients who received Rd alone.1 The overall response rate (ORR) was 92.9 percent in the DARZALEX-Rd arm versus 81.3 percent in the Rd arm (p&lt;0.001).1 The addition of DARZALEX resulted in near-doubling of complete response (CR) or better (47.6 percent vs. 24.9 percent).1 In the MAIA study, treatment with DARZALEX-Rd resulted in a greater than threefold rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity compared to Rd alone (24.2 percent vs. 7.3 percent).1 All patients with MRD-negative status also had a response of CR or better.1 Patients who achieved MRD negativity demonstrated longer PFS than patients who remained MRD-positive, regardless of study treatment.1
The safety of DARZALEX in combination with Rd in this patient population was consistent with previously reported studies.1 The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) (&gt;10 percent) in the DARZALEX-Rd arm compared to Rd alone were neutropenia (50.0 percent vs. 35.3 percent), lymphopenia (15.1 percent vs. 10.7 percent), pneumonia (13.7 percent vs. 7.9 percent), anemia (11.8 vs. 19.7 percent) and leukopenia (11.0 percent vs. 4.9 percent), respectively.1 AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were less frequent in the DARZALEX-Rd group than with Rd alone (7.1 percent vs. 15.9 percent, respectively), despite the higher rate of neutropenia and pneumonia in the DARZALEX-Rd arm.1 There were fewer patients who discontinued the study treatment due to infections in DARZALEX-Rd versus Rd alone (0.5 percent vs. 1.4 percent, respectively).1 DARZALEX-associated infusion-related reactions (IRR) were reported in 40.9 percent of patients (2.7 percent were Grade 3 or 4); there were no Grade 5 events.1 One patient discontinued treatment with DARZALEX after an IRR.1
""The MAIA study findings demonstrate a consistent and clinically meaningful treatment effect when DARZALEX is incorporated into standard backbone regimens, such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone, for the initial treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Craig Tendler</span>, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""We have submitted applications to global health authorities in support of the MAIA data and look forward to working with regulators in the hope of bringing a new combination regimen to patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma.""
<u>About the MAIA Trial</u>1<br class=""dnr"" />The randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study included 737 newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT aged 45 – 90 years old (median age of 73). Patients were randomized to receive either DARZALEX-Rd or Rd alone in 28-day cycles. In the DARZALEX-Rd treatment arm, patients received DARZALEX 16 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) IV weekly for cycles 1 – 2, every two weeks for cycles 3 – 6 and every 4 weeks for cycle 7 and thereafter. Patients in the DARZALEX-Rd and Rd treatment arms received 25 mg of lenalidomide on days 1 – 21 of each 28-day cycle, and dexamethasone at 40 mg once a week for each cycle. Patients in both treatment arms continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
About DARZALEX® (daratumumab) <br class=""dnr"" />DARZALEX® (daratumumab), the first CD38-directed antibody approved anywhere in the world, is the only CD38-directed antibody approved to treat multiple myeloma.2 CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease.3 DARZALEX binds to CD38 and inhibits tumor cell growth causing myeloma cell death.2 DARZALEX may also have an effect on normal cells.2 DARZALEX is being evaluated in a comprehensive clinical development program across a range of treatment settings in multiple myeloma, such as in frontline and relapsed settings.4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess its potential in other malignant and pre-malignant hematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, such as smoldering myeloma.12,13

About Multiple Myeloma<br class=""dnr"" />Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.19,20 When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow.19,20 In 2019, it is estimated that 32,110 people will be diagnosed, and 12,960 will die from the disease, in the U.S.21 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms, which can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood counts, tiredness, high calcium levels, kidney problems or infections.22
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION2
CONTRAINDICATIONS<br class=""dnr"" />DARZALEX® is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS<br class=""dnr"" />Infusion Reactions – DARZALEX® can cause severe and/or serious infusion reactions, including anaphylactic reactions. In clinical trials, approximately half of all patients experienced an infusion reaction. Most infusion reactions occurred during the first infusion and were grade 1-2. Infusion reactions can also occur with subsequent infusions. Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4 hours of completing an infusion. Prior to the introduction of post-infusion medication in clinical trials, infusion reactions occurred up to 48 hours after infusion. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, laryngeal edema and pulmonary edema. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting and nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, and hypotension.
Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion. Interrupt infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion.
To reduce the risk of delayed infusion reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX® infusions. Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Interference with Serological Testing – Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion.
Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient's serum. The determination of a patient's ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX®. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX®.
Neutropenia – DARZALEX® may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. DARZALEX® dose delay may be required to allow recovery of neutrophils. No dose reduction of DARZALEX® is recommended. Consider supportive care with growth factors.
Thrombocytopenia – DARZALEX® may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. DARZALEX® dose delay may be required to allow recovery of platelets. No dose reduction of DARZALEX® is recommended. Consider supportive care with transfusions.
Interference with Determination of Complete Response – Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
Adverse Reactions – The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence =20%) in clinical trials were: infusion reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, muscle spasms, arthralgia, back pain, pyrexia, chills, dizziness, insomnia, cough, dyspnea, peripheral edema, peripheral sensory neuropathy and upper respiratory tract infection.

15046,Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Signs a Co-Promotion and Sales Collaboration Agreement for Diabetes Treatments Equa and EquMet in Japan,"<img class=""size-large wp-image-9277 aligncenter"" src=""http://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PR-1024x531.png"" alt="""" width=""747"" height=""387"" />
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Osaka, Japan; Representative Director, President and CEO: Hiroshi Nomura; hereinafter “Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma”) today signed a co-promotion and sales collaboration agreement with Novartis Pharma K.K. (Head Office: Tokyo, Japan; Representative Director, President and CEO: Kazunari Tunaba; hereinafter “NPKK”) for Equa® 50mg tablets (generic name: vildagliptin; hereinafter “Equa”), a selective DPP-4 inhibitor, and EquMet® combination LD/HD tablets (generic name: vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride combination tablets; hereinafter “EquMet”), a selective DPP-4 inhibitor/biguanide combination agent, both of which are currently indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan.
With the execution of this agreement, starting from July 1, 2019, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma will jointly carry out activities to promote Equa and EquMet to healthcare professionals in Japan, in concert with NPKK. Additionally, from November 1, 2019, while the two companies will continue co-promotion, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma will become the sole distributor of Equa and EquMet, receiving supplies of both products from NPKK.
Equa is a selective DPP-4 inhibitor that increases the concentration of active GLP-1, which enhances insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. EquMet was launched as the first selective DPP-4 inhibitor/biguanide combination tablets launched in the Japanese market. The combined sales of the two drugs were approximately ¥50.0 billion in fiscal 2018 (NHI price base).
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma positions diabetes as one of its focus areas in the Japanese market, and currently commercializes several drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, each with different mechanisms of action. Through the execution of this agreement, Equa and EquMet can now be added to its lineup, helping Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma strive contributing to the treatment of a greater number of diabetes patients in Japan. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma will make upfront payment under the terms of the agreement. It will record payments received from NPKK for the promotion of these products as revenue from July 1, 2019, and the sales of these products as revenue from November 1, 2019.
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma is currently evaluating the potential impact of this agreement on business results for the fiscal year ending March 2020 and will promptly announce any material information requiring disclosure. Financial goals for fiscal 2022, which were announced in conjunction with the Mid- 2 term Business Plan in April 2019, include consideration of a certain amount of contribution from marketing alliances. In addition, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma expects that the agreement announced today will contribute to the attainment of the annual revenue goal of ¥200 billion during the period of the next Mid-term Business Plan (fiscal 2023—2027).
?About Equa? Equa is a DPP-4 inhibitor used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (including any oral hypoglycemic or insulin preparation) that, by increasing the concentration of active GLP-1, stimulates the secretion of insulin and inhibits glucagon secretion to enable effective long-term control of blood sugar levels. The product was launched by NPKK in Japan on April 16, 2010 as Equa® 50mg tablets. On a drug price basis, sales in 2018 were ¥24.9 billion.
?About EquMet? EquMet was the first DPP-4 inhibitor and biguanide combination agent launched in Japan that demonstrated effective lowering of blood sugar levels, combining a DPP-4 inhibitor to stimulate insulin secretion with biguanide to improve insulin resistance through separate mechanisms. The product was launched by NPKK in Japan in November 2015 as EquMet® compound tablets LD/HD. On a drug price basis, sales in 2018 were ¥25.1 billion.

15052,Roche and GE Healthcare launch NAVIFY Tumor Board with medical imaging capabilities to enable more personalised treatment decisions in cancer care,"<h3><img class=""size-large wp-image-9277 aligncenter"" src=""http://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PR-1024x531.png"" alt="""" width=""747"" height=""387"" /></h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Radiologists can now upload their patient records to the same dashboard as patient files from other disciplines</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>First collaboration product enables tumour boards to have a more comprehensive view of each patient in one place</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Important step in Roche’s personalised healthcare strategy to fit treatments to patients who can benefit most from a specific therapy</strong></li>
</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today the release of NAVIFY Tumor Board 2.0, the first collaboration product from our partnership with GE Healthcare. Incorporating medical image viewing and storage capabilities with other patient data, the product enables tumour boards - multi-disciplinary teams who determine treatment plans for cancer patients - to have a more comprehensive view of each patient in one place.
Bringing together patient medical records from various systems for review by tumour boards can be time-consuming and cumbersome. The integration of GE Healthcare’s medical image viewer into NAVIFY Tumor Board 2.0 enables radiologists to upload their patient records to the same dashboard where patient files from other disciplines in the cancer care team are stored. Having complete patient diagnostic information in one location helps specialists use the limited time they have during tumour boards to review all relevant files quickly and align on the best possible treatment plan for each cancer patient.
“This new version of NAVIFY Tumor Board is the first product developed in partnership with GE Healthcare and demonstrates our shared vision of accelerating personalised healthcare,” said Michael Heuer, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Our mutual focus is on delivering clinical decision support solutions that enable healthcare professionals to make faster, more confident decisions, allowing more personalized treatment based on truly integrated diagnostics.”
“We are delighted to announce the first major milestone of our ongoing collaboration with Roche, as we work together to enable precision healthcare. Workflows around tumour boards can be inefficient, and we hope this single, holistic dashboard - including patient data and images - will enable oncology teams to align more quickly on the most optimal diagnosis and treatment plan for the benefit of each patient,” said Tom McGuinness, President and CEO, GE Healthcare Imaging.
The partnership combines Roche expertise in advanced lab testing and the GE Healthcare leadership in medical imaging and monitoring to provide an ecosystem of workflow solutions and apps on an industry-first shared integrated diagnostics platform. The companies are aiming to design products to enable seamless integration and analysis of comprehensive lab and medical imaging data, patient records, medical best practice, real time monitoring and the latest research outcomes. Clinicians will then have confidence that they are making the best possible treatment decision for each patient.
The new version of NAVIFY Tumor Board is initially available in the United States and Canada with additional markets to follow in the near future.
<h3>About the NAVIFY Decision Support portfolio</h3>
The NAVIFY Decision Support portfolio helps healthcare professionals navigate the increasing complexity of medical and scientific information by transforming large amounts of data into actionable insights -fundamentally changing clinical decision making across the care continuum. NAVIFY Tumor Board, a cloud-based software solution, streamlines and standardizes preparation, facilitation and documentation of treatment decisions by oncology care teams. The NAVIFY portfolio is continuously evolving to include additional solutions that support more personalized, confident treatment decisions for the benefit of each individual patient.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Survival Benefit Now Observed with KEYTRUDA in Combination with Chemotherapy in All Patient Populations (Regardless of PD-L1 Expression) and with KEYTRUDA Monotherapy in Patients Whose Tumors Expressed PD-L1 at CPS =1</b></p>
<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Data Presented Today at 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting</b></p>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the presentation of the final analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 trial investigating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (Abstract #6000). Data include the first-time presentation of certain overall survival (OS) hypotheses from the KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy study arm based on PD-L1 expression and the KEYTRUDA monotherapy study arm in the total patient population. Results of an interim analysis were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2018 Congress and demonstrated superior OS outcomes for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in the total population and KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with Combined Positive Score (CPS) =20 and CPS =1 compared with the EXTREME regimen, the current standard of care.
“It is exciting to see the full results from this trial, which is the first study to show superior overall survival over the current standard of care known as the EXTREME regimen,” said Dr. Danny Rischin, director of the department of medical oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia. “Patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer have a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. These findings underscore the potential of KEYTRUDA monotherapy and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy to become important new treatment options.”
The new findings presented today from the final analysis showed that KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin plus 5-FU) reduced the risk of death by 40% in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with CPS=20, demonstrating significantly longer OS (14.7 months [95% CI, 10.3-19.3]) compared with the EXTREME regimen (cetuximab with carboplatin or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]), the current standard of care (11.0 months [95% CI, 9.2-13.0]) (HR=0.60 [95% CI, 0.45-0.82]; p=0.0004). For the dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), statistical significance was not achieved for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in the CPS=20 population compared with the EXTREME regimen (HR=0.73 [95% CI, 0.55-.97]; p=0.0162). New findings for the CPS =1 population showed KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by 35% in these patients, with significantly longer OS (13.6 months [95% CI, 10.7-15.5]) compared with the EXTREME regimen (10.4 months [95% CI, 9.1-11.7]) (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.53-0.80]; p&lt;0.0001). Per the sequential testing strategy, superiority for PFS was not tested in this population (HR=0.82 [95% CI, 0.67-1.00]). Results for OS with KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the total population were consistent with the previously presented interim analysis, where non-inferiority was demonstrated (HR=0.83 [95% CI, 0.70-0.99]; p=0.0199), with a median OS of 11.5 months (95% CI, 10.3-13.4) for KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the total population compared with 10.7 months (95% CI, 9.3-11.7) for the EXTREME regimen. There was no difference in PFS between KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the total population and the EXTREME regimen (HR=1.34 [95% CI, 1.13-1.59]).
“As a company, Merck is committed to advancing research in this challenging treatment setting through our expansive head and neck cancer clinical research program,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “The full data from KEYNOTE-048 illustrate the impact of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy as potential new first-line treatment options for patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We would like to sincerely thank the patients and investigators for their involvement in KEYNOTE-048.”
As previously announced, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted priority review for a new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking approval for KEYTRUDA as monotherapy or in combination with platinum and 5-FU chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC based in part on data from the second interim analysis of KEYNOTE-048. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of June 10, 2019.
<b>Study Design and Additional Data from KEYNOTE-048 (Abstract #6000)</b>
KEYNOTE-048, a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/"">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, NCT02358031), evaluated KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy or KEYTRUDA monotherapy, compared with the EXTREME regimen, as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. The dual primary endpoints were OS and PFS. The secondary endpoints were PFS (at six months and 12 months), objective response rate (ORR) and time to deterioration in the Quality of Life Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scales of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire and Safety. Duration of response (DOR) was evaluated as part of a pre-specified exploratory analysis. The primary and secondary endpoints, as well as exploratory DOR analysis, were evaluated in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS =20 and CPS =1) and in the total population, based on a fixed sequential testing strategy. Data cutoff for the final analysis was Feb. 25, 2019; data cutoff for the previously presented second interim analysis was June 13, 2018. Details of the OS benefit observed at the final analysis are below:

<b>About Head and Neck Cancer</b>
Head and neck cancer describes a number of different tumors that develop in or around the throat, larynx, nose, sinuses and mouth. Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas that begin in the flat, squamous cells that make up the thin surface layer of the structures in the head and neck. Two substances that greatly increase the risk of developing head and neck cancer are tobacco and alcohol. It is estimated that there were more than 887,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed and over 453,000 deaths from the disease worldwide in 2018. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated that there will be more than 65,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed and over 14,000 deaths from the disease in 2019.
<b>About KEYTRUDA</b> <sup><b>®</b> </sup><b>(pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg</b>
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis, or Hepatoxicity (in Combination With Axitinib)</b>
<i>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</i>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<i>Hepatotoxicity (in Combination With Axitinib)</i>
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and AST were seen in 20% and 13% of patients, respectively. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are used in monotherapy. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less fo",31-05-2019,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/mercks-keytruda-pembrolizumab-demonstrates-improved-overall-survival-as-first-line-treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma-at-final-analysis-of-pivotal-ph/,mercks-keytruda-pembrolizumab-demonstrates-improved-overall-survival-as-first-line-treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma-at-final-analysis-of-pivotal-ph
