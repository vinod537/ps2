DUBLIN, Dec. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for UBRELVY™ (ubrogepant) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. UBRELVY™ is the first and only orally-administered calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant) for the treatment of migraine attacks once they start. Migraine is a neurological disease characterized by intermittent migraine attacks with symptoms that are often incapacitating. Migraine afflicts 31 million Americans and is the third most common disease and second leading cause of disability worldwide.

<div id=""prni_dvprnejpge1e5left"" dir=""ltr""><img id=""prnejpge1e5left"" title=""Allergan plc logo"" src=""https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/222796/allergan_plc_logo.jpg"" alt=""Allergan plc logo"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" /></div>
""The FDA's approval of UBRELVY™, a new oral option that is effective in the acute treatment of migraine attacks, is a much-welcomed development for me and for many who care for patients. I can offer my migraine patients a new treatment option that may work for them,"" said Dr. Peter Goadsby, Neurologist and Professor at King's College, London, and University of California, San Francisco, and a paid consultant for Allergan. ""Perhaps even better, I am able to offer a new sense of hope for my patients who struggle for relief from this highly disabling problem.""
In clinical trials supporting the FDA's approval, UBRELVY™ provided quick pain relief for the majority of migraine patients. UBRELVY™ also met co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from the most bothersome symptom (nausea, hypersensitivity to light, or hypersensitivity to sound), a recent, more stringent standard of efficacy the FDA set in 2018. UBRELVY™ provided lasting relief up to 24 hours as well. UBRELVY™ works in a new way by blocking CGRP, a protein that is released during a migraine attack, from binding to its receptors. It works without constricting blood vessels, which some older treatments are known to do. UBRELVY™ is non-narcotic, not scheduled, and does not have addiction potential. It has been approved with two dose strengths, 50 mg and 100 mg, and is specially designed so healthcare providers can provide a personalized treatment approach for appropriate patients.
""As someone living with migraine for 14 years, my life seems to be on pause when I experience a migraine attack,"" said Kristin Molacek, UBRELVY™ clinical trial patient. ""During the clinical trial, my experience with UBRELVY™ was positive. It relieved the migraine symptoms that bothered me the most without serious side effects. We have needed this type of on-demand oral relief for a very long time, and I look forward to having the ability to better manage my migraine attacks.""
""We are extremely pleased that UBRELVY™ is now approved by the FDA. As the first oral gepant, UBRELVY™ offers a new and different type of acute treatment option for people living with the debilitating pain and other symptoms of migraine,"" said David Nicholson, EVP and Chief R&amp;D Officer, Allergan. ""Its oral administration with two dose strengths allows for treatment flexibility and relief when a migraine attack occurs. As we continue to drive innovation in migraine treatment, we are very proud to offer patients another option, and we are confident that it will make a difference for those in need. At Allergan, we believe that migraine patients deserve access to all new medications for this debilitating disease.""
<b>About UBRELVY™ (ubrogepant)
</b>UBRELVY™ (ubrogepant) is a novel, highly potent, orally-administered calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults that is an option for a wide range of patients who experience migraine attacks. It works in a new way by blocking CGRP, a protein released during a migraine attack, from binding to its receptors. It works without constricting blood vessels, which some older treatments are known to do. CGRP receptor antagonism is a completely new mechanism of action for the acute treatment of migraine.
The FDA approval for UBRELVY™ is based on four clinical studies (ACHIEVE I, ACHIEVE II, UBR-MD-04 and 3110-105-002), which demonstrated efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally-administered UBRELVY™ in the acute treatment of migraine. The two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (ACHIEVE I and ACHIEVE II) established the safety and efficacy profile of UBRELVY™. Both 50 mg and 100 mg dose strengths demonstrated significantly greater rates of pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours, compared with placebo.
Nausea was the most common adverse event reported in 1.7-4.1% of patients at various doses during the pivotal studies, compared to 1.6-2.0% of patients who received placebo. There were no serious adverse events within 48 hours of a dose. Additionally, the safety study (UBR-MD-04) reinforced the long-term safety and tolerability of UBRELVY™ for both the 50 mg and 100 mg dose strengths. Our research shows that UBRELVY™ was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo.

UBRELVY™ will be available in the first quarter of 2020.

<h3><b>First fixed-dose triple-combination therapy in a
pressurised metered-dose inhaler device in China</b></h3>
<h3><b>Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate is known as
PT010 outside of China and as <i>Breztri Aerosphere</i> in Japan

<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca today announced that budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate has been approved in China for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
This is the first approval by the National Medical Products Administration for a triple-combination therapy in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI), which uses the innovative <i>Aerosphere</i> delivery technology.
The approval follows a priority review and is based on results from the Phase III KRONOS trial in which PT010<i></i>demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), the primary endpoint for China, compared with dual-combination therapies <i>Bevespi Aerosphere</i> (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) and PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate).
The safety and tolerability of PT010 were consistent with the known profiles of the dual comparators. Data from the KRONOS trial were published in <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(18)30327-8/fulltext"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The Lancet Respiratory Medicine</i></a> in October 2018.
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affects almost 100 million people in China, and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. With this approval, we are now able to provide a powerful new triple-combination therapy to patients for whom new treatments are critically needed. Our triple-combination therapy is administered in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler, an important device option for clinicians and patients in China.”
Professor Wang Chen, Director of China National Clinical Research Centre for Respiratory Diseases, Director of the Centre for Respiratory Disease at China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and China National Lead Investigator of the KRONOS trial, said: “Addressing the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in China is a public health priority and triple-combination therapy will play an important role in helping patients manage their disease. In the KRONOS trial, budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate provided rapid and sustained lung function improvements in patients with moderate-to-very-severe disease.”
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate<i> </i>was <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/breztri-aerosphere-pt010-approved-in-japan-for-patients-with-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-19062019.html"">approved in Japan</a> in June 2019<i> </i>as <i>Breztri Aerosphere,</i> a triple-combination therapy to relieve symptoms of COPD. The medicine is also under regulatory review in the US and EU, under the name PT010.
<b>About COPD</b>
COPD is a progressive disease which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness.<sup>1</sup> It affects an estimated 384 million people worldwide and approximately 100 million people in China.<sup>2,3</sup>COPD is predicted to be the third leading cause of death globally by 2020.<sup>1</sup> Improving lung function, reducing exacerbations and managing daily symptoms such as breathlessness are important treatment goals in the management of COPD.<sup>1</sup>
<b>About ATHENA</b>
ATHENA is AstraZeneca’s Phase III global clinical trial programme for PT010, including 11 completed trials with more than 15,500 patients.<sup>4,5,6,7 </sup>The four key trials are ETHOS, KRONOS, TELOS and SOPHOS.<sup>4,5,6,7</sup> The ETHOS and KRONOS trials assessed the efficacy and safety of PT010.<sup>4,5</sup> The TELOS and SOPHOS trials characterised PT009 and substantiated it as an active comparator in the PT010 clinical trial programme.<sup>6,7</sup>
In the KRONOS Phase III randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre trial, PT010 met six of seven lung function primary endpoints versus dual-combination therapies <i>Bevespi Aerosphere</i>, <i>Symbicort Turbuhaler</i>(budesonide/formoterol fumarate) and PT009 in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD, in a patient population without a requirement for an exacerbation in the previous year.<sup>5</sup> PT009 also met two non-inferiority endpoints to support its qualification as an active comparator. As published in <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(18)30327-8/fulltext"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The Lancet Respiratory Medicine</i></a>, in a key secondary endpoint, PT010 showed a statistically significant 52% reduction in the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared with <i>Bevespi Aerosphere.</i><sup>5</sup>
In the ETHOS Phase III randomised, double-blinded, multi-centre, parallel-group, 52-week trial, PT010<i> </i>demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with dual-combination therapies <i>Bevespi Aerosphere </i>and PT009 in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD and a history of exacerbation(s) in the previous year.<sup>4 </sup>Full trial design details are published in <a href=""https://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111(19)30267-7/fulltext"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>Respiratory Medicine</i></a>.<sup>8</sup> AstraZeneca <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/breztri-aerosphere-phase-iii-ethos-trial-met-its-primary-endpoint-in-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-28082019.html"">announced</a> results from the Phase III ETHOS trial in August 2019.<sup>9</sup>
<i>Bevespi Aerosphere</i> is a fixed-dose dual bronchodilator in a pMDI, combining glycopyrronium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA). <i>Symbicort Turbuhaler</i> is a single inhaler containing budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and formoterol, a LABA. PT009 is a single inhaler, fixed-dose dual-combination therapy of budesonide, an ICS, and formoterol fumarate, a LABA.
<b>About<i> </i>PT010<i></i></b>
PT010 is a single-inhaler, fixed-dose triple-combination of budesonide, an ICS, with glycopyrronium, a LAMA, and formoterol fumarate, a LABA. The China approval for PT010<i> </i>follows a priority review designated for treatments that utilise advanced dosage technology, innovative treatment measures or clinical treatment advantage.
Under the terms of the agreement to acquire Pearl Therapeutics Inc., AstraZeneca anticipates making a $150m milestone payment upon US regulatory approval of PT010<i> </i>for COPD. This payment would be the final development and regulatory milestone under that agreement.

<h3><b><i>Accelerated Approval of AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo’s Enhertu based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial that showed</i></b><i> <b>clinically meaningful and durable responses
</b></i></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi Sankyo) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved <i>Enhertu</i> (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting.
This indication is approved under Accelerated Approval based on tumour response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.
<i>Enhertu</i> is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and the FDA approval is based on the results of the registrational Phase II trial DESTINY-Breast01 of <i>Enhertu </i>(5.4mg/kg) monotherapy in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. All patients received prior trastuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine and 66% had prior pertuzumab.
The Phase II trial results showed a confirmed objective response rate of 60.3% (n=111, 95% CI 52.9-67.4) including a 4.3% complete response rate (n=8) and a 56.0% partial response rate (n=103). A median duration of response of 14.8 months (95% CI 13.8-16.9) was demonstrated as of 1 August 2019.<sup>1</sup> In addition, a median progression-free survival of 16.4 months (95% CI 12.7-not estimable), based upon a median duration of follow up of 11.1 months, was recently presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium and published online in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1914510?query=featured_home"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>.<sup>2</sup>
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “<i>Enhertu</i> has shown impressive results in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with the majority of women benefiting from treatment and the median duration of the response exceeding 14 months. With this first approval, we are proud to bring <i>Enhertu </i>to patients with high unmet need and we look forward to further exploring its potential in additional settings.”
Antoine Yver, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology R&amp;D, Daiichi Sankyo said: “The approval of <i>Enhertu</i> underscores that this specifically engineered HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate is delivering on its intent to establish an important new treatment for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Since the beginning of our clinical trial programme four years ago, we have focused on the opportunity to transform the treatment landscape for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, and we are extremely proud of how quickly we delivered <i>Enhertu</i> to patients in the US, as <i>Enhertu</i> represents one of the fastest-developed biologics in oncology.”
The safety of <i>Enhertu</i> has been evaluated in a pooled analysis from both the Phase II trial DESTINY-Breast01 and the earlier Phase I trial among a total of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of <i>Enhertu</i> (5.4mg/kg).
The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20% of patients) were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, alopecia and constipation. Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD/pneumonitis occurred in six patients (2.6%) - two deaths previously reported in the Phase I trial and four deaths previously reported in the Phase II trial DESTINY-Breast01. Following an initial ILD management programme already in place, a further monitoring, management and educational campaign on ILD/pneumonitis was launched in 2019. Patients and physicians should be aware of ILD/pneumonitis and patients should be actively screened and monitored for potential signs and symptoms. If ILD/pneumonitis is identified, it should be managed with dose modification and steroid treatment according to management guidelines.<sup>2</sup>
A regulatory submission for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer has also been made to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare based on the DESTINY-Breast01 and Phase I trials.
AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo are exploring the further potential of <i>Enhertu</i> in HER2-breast cancer with three ongoing Phase III trials.
<b>Financial considerations</b>
Following US approval, an amount of $125m is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo as the first milestone payment in HER2-positive breast cancer. Upon approval, this will be capitalised together with the upfront payment already made earlier in the year 2019.
Future sales of <i>Enhertu</i> in the US will be recognised by Daiichi Sankyo. AstraZeneca will report its share of gross profit margin from the sales in the US as collaboration revenue in the Company’s financial statements. For further details on the financial arrangements, please consult the <a href=""https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/astrazeneca/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=1343&amp;newsid=1243761"" rel=""link-confirmation"">announcement</a> of the collaboration agreement from March 2019.
<b>About HER2-positive breast cancer</b>
Approximately one in five breast cancers are HER2-positive.<sup>3,4 </sup>Despite recent improvements and approvals of new medicines, there remains significant unmet needs for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.<sup>5,6</sup> This disease remains incurable with patients eventually progressing after available treatments.<sup>5,6</sup>
<b>About HER2</b>
HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein found on the surface of some cancer cells that is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer.<sup>7</sup> To be considered HER2-positive, tumour cancer cells are usually tested by one of two methods: immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). IHC test results are reported as: 0, IHC 1+, IHC 2+, or IHC 3+.<sup>3</sup> A finding of IHC 3+ and/or FISH amplification is considered positive.<sup>3</sup>
<b>About DESTINY-Breast01</b>
DESTINY-Breast01 is a registrational Phase II, single-arm, open-label, global, multicentre, two-part trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of <i>Enhertu</i> in patients with HER2-positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate, as determined by independent central review. Secondary objectives include duration of response, disease control rate, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival and overall survival. Enrolment into DESTINY-Breast01 was completed in September 2018 with 184 patients at more than 100 sites globally.
<b>About <i>Enhertu</i></b>
<i>Enhertu</i> (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the US only; trastuzumab deruxtecan outside the US) is the lead product in the ADC Franchise of the Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise and the most advanced programme in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells.
<b>About <i>Enhertu</i></b> <b>clinical development</b>
A comprehensive development programme is underway globally with five registrational trials in HER2-expressing metastatic breast and gastric cancers including a trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer and low levels of HER2 expression. Phase II trials are underway for HER2-expressing advanced colorectal cancer, as well as metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.
<b>About the collaboration between AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo</b>
In March 2019, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialise <i>Enhertu</i> worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for manufacturing and supply.

<span class=""xn-location"">TAIPEI, Taiwan</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 26, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- OBI Pharma, Inc., a <span class=""xn-location"">Taiwan</span> biopharma company (TPEx: 4174), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation for OBI-999 for the treatment of Pancreatic Cancer. OBI-999 is a first-in-class antibody drug conjugate targeting Globo H, a glycolipid antigen.
A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of OBI-999 has commenced enrollment at the <span class=""xn-org"">University of Texas</span> M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, with Dr. Apostolia M. Tsimberidou as the Principal Investigator, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including Pancreatic, Gastric, Colorectal and Esophageal Cancers (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04084366). The objective of the trial is to verify the safety and preliminary efficacy profile of OBI-999 in these patient populations.
<span class=""xn-person"">Tillman Pearce</span>, MD, CMO, OBI Pharma noted, ""We are very excited about the potential value that OBI-999 may provide to patients with pancreatic cancer given both the high potency we have observed using OBI-999 in pancreatic cancer xenograft models and because many pancreas cancers highly overexpress Globo H, the glycolipid target of OBI-999, using the validated IHC assay that will be available for selecting patients for the Phase 2 portion of this first-in-human clinical trial.""
<b>About Pancreatic Cancer</b>
Pancreatic Cancer originates in the exocrine or endocrine pancreatic cells and is thought to be caused by poor diet, smoking, and genetic factors. Pancreatic Cancer is a deadly disease that currently affects 69,839 people in the US and has a survival rate of only 8.5% at five years. In addition, treatment options are limited to surgical resection for patients with early stages of the disease and these patients may only have a five-year survival rate of up to 34.3%. As Pancreatic Cancer is asymptomatic in early stages, a majority of patients are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed until advanced stages of the disease. Surgery is no longer effective at this stage of the disease, leaving a large population with limited treatment options.
<b>About Orphan Drug Designation (ODD)</b>
The orphan drug designation provides OBI Pharma with potential benefits, including market exclusivity upon regulatory approval if received, exemption of FDA application fees, and tax credits for qualified clinical trials. The FDA's Office of Orphan Drug Products grants orphan status to support development of medicines for rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.
<b>About OBI-999</b>
OBI-999 is a novel first-in-class Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) with a proprietary linker technology that provides a consistent Drug-to-Antibody ratio (DAR) for cancer treatment that is based on Globo H, an antigen expressed in up to 15 epithelial cancers. OBI-999 uses a Globo H antibody to target cancer cells of high Globo H expression. By releasing a small molecule chemotherapeutic drug through the specificity of the antibody, it directly deploys cytotoxic therapy at the targeted cancer cells. OBI-999 is currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04084366) to test its safety and efficacy as an oncology ADC therapy. In pre-clinical xenograft animal models in multiple tumor types (pancreatic, lung, gastric, and breast), OBI-999 has demonstrated profound tumor shrinkage at various doses. In pre-clinical single and repeated dose toxicology studies, OBI-999 was well-tolerated, and achieved a favorable safety margin which warrants further clinical development. OBI Pharma owns global rights to OBI-999.

<p class=""text-align-center""><em>The acquisition adds talent and proprietary therapeutic platform to accelerate next-generation cancer immunotherapy</em></p>
<p class=""text-align-center""><em>Xyphos shareholders to receive up to $665 million in structured, milestone-based acquisition</em></p>
<strong>TOKYO and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. - December 26, 2019</strong> - Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) and Xyphos Biosciences, Inc. (CEO: James Knighton, “Xyphos”) today announced that Astellas has acquired Xyphos. With the acquisition Astellas will gain Xyphos’ novel and proprietary ACCEL (Advanced Cellular Control through Engineered Ligands) technology platform, as well as industry-leading immuno-oncology talent, to develop new and potentially better ways to mobilize, target and control immune cells to find, modulate and destroy targeted cells throughout the body.
“At Astellas, immuno-oncology is a Primary Focus of our research and development strategy, and we are working on the development of next-generation cancer immuno-therapy using new modalities/technologies,” said Kenji Yasukawa, President and CEO, Astellas. “The innovative technology in development at Xyphos fits perfectly in advancing our immuno-oncology strategy to create and deliver value for patients. Combining this technology with our capabilities in cell therapy that we have been working on so far, we can create next-generation high-function cells and maximize the value of our technology. We look forward to working with Xyphos’ superb team to advance and expand their clinical development programs to bring their novel therapeutics to patients.”
“At Xyphos, we are driven to advance our innovative cell therapy technology platform as an exciting new approach to potentially manage and cure cancer,” said James Knighton, Chief Executive Officer, Xyphos. “Astellas’ commitment to immuno-oncology makes them an ideal partner to advance our proprietary NKG2D-based NK-cell and T-cell platform to the next stage of clinical exploration. Further, we look forward to becoming part of Astellas to accelerate this immuno-oncology research and development in the vibrant South San Francisco community.”
Xyphos has developed a flexible and versatile synthetic biology platform to direct cells of the immune system to target single or multiple tumor antigens while controlling the immune cell proliferation and endurance. Xyphos’s proprietary molecules can be delivered to natural immune cells or to engineered Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) cells to generate immunotherapies for oncology. Xyphos’ patented CAR technology is based on an engineered modification to a natural human receptor named NKG2D. NKG2D exists on natural killer (NK) cells and some T-cells. The designed modification of NKG2D renders it inert, that is, unable to bind to any of its natural ligands, which occur on stressed cells. Through further protein engineering, several natural ligands of NKG2D have been modified to bind exclusively to the otherwise inert NKG2D receptor. Various functional molecules (for example, antibodies that recognize specific tumor antigens) are attached to the modified ligand. The ligand-directed functional molecules then bind exclusively to immune cells expressing the inert CAR on their surface – the proprietary <em>convertible</em>CAR<sup>®</sup>-cells. The CAR-cells can be directed by the ligand-bound antibody to seek, become activated and attacks a targeted cancer cell. Xyphos’ first <em>convertible</em>CAR-T cell product candidate is in preclinical development and scheduled to be tested in a first-in-human clinical study in 2021.
Considering the acquisition, $ 120 million was paid upon closing of the acquisition, and Xyphos became a wholly owned subsidiary of Astellas. In addition to this payment and potential future development milestone payments, it will provide a total transaction value of $ 665 million.
The impact of this transaction on Astellas’ financial results in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 will be limited.

This application is mainly based on the result from Part 1 of CheckMate -227, a global multipart,open-label, randomized Phase III clinical study, conducted by ONO and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY, “BMS”), in patients with chemotherapy-naive Stage IV or recurrent NSCLC. In this result, Opdivo and Yervoy combination therapy achieved a significant improvement in the independent coprimary endpoint of overall survival (OS) in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 ?1%, compared
to chemotherapy.
About Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is considered to be a form of malignant tumor that arises from cells in the trachea, bronchi and alveoli. Lung cancer is divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and NSCLC, depending on the broad histological subtypes. NSCLC is one of the most common types of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of lung cancer1). NSCLC is further classified into adenocarcinoma
(about 40% of lung cancer), squamous cell carcinoma (about 25%) and large cell carcinoma (about 10%) 2). Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer with an estimated 2,090,000 new diagnoses per year worldwide (about 118,000 cases in Japan). It is estimated that approximately 1,760,000 eaths resulting from the disease per year worldwide (approximately 81,000 in Japan), showing the
first leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both cases3). Survival rates vary depending on the stage and type of the cancer when diagnosed. For patients diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer, the five-year survival rate is less than 5%.

About CheckMate-227 study
This study is a global multipart, open-label, randomized Phase III clinical study, evaluating Opdivo, or Opdivo plus Yervoy, or Opdivo plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy compared to platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients with chemotherapy-naive Stage IV or recurrent NSCLC. This study consists
of the following 3 Parts:
1) Part 1a: Evaluating the efficacy and safety of Opdivo, or Opdivo plus Yervoy versus chemotherapy
in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 ?1%
2) Part 1b: Evaluating the efficacy and safety of Opdivo plus Yervoy, or Opdivo plus platinum-doublet
chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 &lt;1%
3) Part 2: Evaluating the efficacy and safety of Opdivo plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy versus
chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1
In Opdivo and Yervoy combination therapy of Part 1, patients received Opdivo 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus Yervoy 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks as a combination therapy up to 24 weeks, until disease progression or onset of unacceptable toxicity is observed. The primary endpoints of Part 1 are overall survival (OS) in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 ?1% in Part 1a, and progression-free
survival (PFS) in patients with tumor mutational burden (TMB) ?10 mut/Mb (mutations/megabase) in Part 1a and 1b.
About Opdivo
Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers since the approval for the treatment of melanoma in Japan in July 2014. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65
countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, the US and European Union. In Japan, ONO launched Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable melanoma in September 2014. Thereafter, Opdivo received an approval for additional indications of unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer in December 2015, unresectable or metastatic renal cell cancer
in August 2016, relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma in December 2016, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer in March 2017, unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer which has progressed after chemotherapy in September 2017, unresectable advanced or recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma which has progressed after chemotherapy and adjuvant treatment of melanoma, etc. in August 2018.
In addition, ONO has submitted supplemental applications for the treatment of microsatellite instable High (MSI-H) colorectal cancer and esophageal cancer, and is conducting clinical development program including esophageal cancer, esophago-gastric junction cancer, small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, urothelial cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer,
colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer, etc.
About Yervoy
Yervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody, and binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyteassociated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4, and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell  function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Yervoy 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Yervoy is now
approved in more than 60 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for
Yervoy spanning multiple tumor types. In Japan, BMSKK received an approval of Yervoy for the treatment of unresectable melanoma in
July 2015. Yervoy was also approved in combination therapy with Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable melanoma in May 2018, followed by unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma in August 2018.
About the ONO and Bristol-Myers Squibb Collaboration
In 2011, through a collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), ONO granted BMS its territorial rights to develop and commercialize Opdivo globally except in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where ONO had retained all rights to Opdivo except the US at the time. In July 2014, ONO and BMS further expanded the companies’ strategic collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize multiple immunotherapies – as single agent and combination regimens – for patients with cancer in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

The PDUFA target action date of the resubmitted BLA is June 2, 2020.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are pleased that the FDA has accepted our resubmission, which was a top priority for us in 2019,” said Dr. Behzad Aghazadeh, executive chairman of Immunomedics. “We look forward to working closely with the FDA to facilitate their review of our BLA to enable us to bring this potentially transformational treatment to patients affected by mTNBC.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Sacituzumab govitecan has been awarded both Fast Track Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">TNBC is an aggressive disease with an annual incidence estimated to be about 40,000 people, approximately 15% of all breast cancer types, in the United States alone. The incidence rate is higher among younger women and highest among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women. TNBC tumors do not have sufficient estrogen, progesterone or HER2 receptor expression to indicate the use of hormonal or HER2-directed therapy. There is currently no standard-of-care chemotherapy for people with relapsed/refractory mTNBC. An overall response rate of about 10% and median progression-free survival of 2-3 months have recently been reported in late-stage mTNBC using single-agent chemotherapy.<sup>1,2</sup></p>

<span class=""xn-location"">SHANGHAI</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 26, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Luye Pharma Group has announced submission of a new drug application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for LY03005, a new chemical drug for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It is also the second U.S. FDA NDA submission in the central nervous system (CNS) filed by the company.
The application was based on the consensus reached with the FDA under End-Of-Phase 2-CMC (EOP2-CMC) meeting and Pre-NDA (PNDA) meeting. LY03005 is an exclusive CNS product developed under Luye Pharma's new chemical/therapeutic entities (NCE/NTE) R&amp;D platform. It is a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine triple reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI), and one of the active metabolites is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).
Depression is one of the most common CNS diseases, with more than 300 million patients around the world. It is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. Today, fewer than 50% of patients are receiving effective treatment, with rates of effective treatment in many countries lower than 10%.
Patients using traditional anti-depressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) typically have certain drawbacks such as anhedonia, sexual dysfunction and inability to improve cognitive impairment, etc. Compared to traditional anti-depressants, SNDRI is expected to help preserve patients' sexual function and produce a more rapid onset with higher efficacy.

Pharming will take control of commercial rights to its product RUCONEST® in all 36
remaining countries
• Pharming will pay a total of €7.5 million in two tranches for a smooth transition of the
existing activity and to terminate the license early
• The transaction will be accretive to earnings immediately
Leiden, The Netherlands, 30 December 2019: Pharming Group N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM)
today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ)
(“Sobi”) to reacquire the commercial rights to Pharming’s product, RUCONEST®, in all remaining
territories, which includes all remaining EU markets. Under the agreement, the license is being
terminated with effect from 1 January 2020 in all 36 countries with a smooth handover planned in the
countries where Sobi has sales activities. Pharming will pay Sobi €7.5 million in two tranches.
Following the strategic decision to reaquire the North American commercial rights for RUCONEST® in
December 2016 from its licensee Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (now “Bausch Health”),
Pharming has increased US sales significantly. It is anticipated that, while not of the same commercial
scale as the US, a growth increase in the additional 36 territories can be expected. The transaction will
be accretive to earnings immediately.
RUCONEST® has been licensed for a total of 60 different countries in this region since 2010, and was
launched in a number of these countries. Commercialization rights for RUCONEST® in 24 of the 60
countries have been returned to Pharming in previous years.
In order to ensure that existing RUCONEST® patients can continue to receive their therapy, Pharming
will be cooperating with Sobi to replace all contracts for distribution and other services as quickly as
possible, and to transfer existing reimbursement approvals where possible. While Pharming will be
responsible for the distribution of RUCONEST® in the 36 reaquired territories from the 1 January 2020,
it may be some time before all activities and full control have been transferred. No personnel will be
transferring between the two companies.
Sijmen de Vries, Chief Executive of Pharming, said:
“Our strategic decision to reacquire the commercial rights to RUCONEST® from Sobi builds
on the commercial success of the product in the US and now means we own commerical
rights to our lead asset for the treatment of HAE in all countries, except some markets in
Latin America, Israel and South Korea. The transaction will enable us to drive further growth
of RUCONEST® and will be accretive to earnings immediately. In addition, we will expand our
existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to support the expected launch of future new
products from our pipeline, including the recently in-licensed, late-stage compound,
leniolisib, for the treatment of APDS.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Pharming will pay a total payment of €7.5 million in two tranches,
the larger part upfront with a final payment once all transition activities are complete or underway.
There are no further future payments under this agreement.

United Kingdom and the United States of America. Pharming holds commercialisation rights in Algeria,
Andorra, Bahrain, Belgium, Ireland, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Portugal, Qatar, Syria,
Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. In some of these countries distribution is
made in association with the HAEi Global Access Program (GAP). As of 1 January 2020 RUCONEST® will
also be distributed by Pharming in the other EU countries as well as Serbia and Norway, and Pharming
will hold commercialization rights in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein,
Russia, Serbia and Ukraine and the remaining countries in the Middle East region. Before 1 January
2020 these territories were licenced to Sobi.

<span class=""xn-location"">WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 27, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Eisai Inc., the U.S. pharmaceutical subsidiary of Eisai Co., Ltd., today announced that <i>JAMA Network Open</i> (<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2679560-1&amp;h=3554662222&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jamanetwork.com%2F&amp;a=www.jamanetwork.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">www.jamanetwork.com</a>) published results of SUNRISE 1 (Study 304), a pivotal Phase 3 head-to-head study that compared DAYVIGO™ (lemborexant) to placebo and an active comparator in patients with insomnia disorder.<sup>1</sup> In this study, DAYVIGO therapy significantly improved both sleep onset and sleep maintenance compared with placebo.
""We are pleased to share these important study results in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Lynn Kramer</span>, MD, Chief Clinical Officer, Neurology Business Group, Eisai. ""The study featured in this publication provides insights into why this agent may make an important difference for patients living with insomnia.""
SUNRISE 1 was a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator parallel-group study of 1,006 adults 55 years of age or older with insomnia disorder receiving DAYVIGO 5 mg or 10 mg, an active comparator or placebo for one month at bedtime. The primary study endpoint was the change from baseline in latency to persistent sleep for DAYVIGO therapy versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints were changes from baseline in sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset compared with placebo, and wake after sleep onset in the second half of the night compared with the active comparator. Treatment-emergent adverse events reported in =2% of participants in any active treatment group included headache (6.2% for placebo, 5.3% for active comparator, 6.4% for DAYVIGO 5 mg, and 4.9% for DAYVIGO 10 mg) and somnolence (1.9% for placebo, 1.5% for active comparator, 4.1% for DAYVIGO 5 mg, and 7.1% for DAYVIGO 10 mg). Full study results can be accessed in the <i>JAMA Network Open</i> publication.
DAYVIGO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on <span class=""xn-chron"">December 20, 2019</span> for the treatment of adult patients with insomnia, characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance.<sup>2</sup> The FDA has recommended that DAYVIGO be classified as a controlled substance and this recommendation has been submitted to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). DAYVIGO will be commercially available following scheduling by the DEA, which is expected to occur within 90 days of the product's approval. The Full Prescribing Information is available <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2679560-1&amp;h=2294459359&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fus.eisai.com%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FEisai%2FPrescribingInformation.pdf&amp;a=here"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.

<b>1.     About Lemborexant<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Lemborexant is a small-molecule compound, discovered and developed by Eisai in-house scientists, that inhibits orexin signaling by binding competitively to both orexin receptor subtypes (orexin receptor 1 and 2). In individuals with normal daily sleep-wake rhythms, orexin signaling is believed to promote periods of wakefulness. In individuals with sleep-wake disorders, it is possible that orexin signaling that regulates wakefulness is not functioning normally.
<b>INDICATION</b>
DAYVIGO (lemborexant) is an orexin receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of adult patients with insomnia, characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>
<b>CONTRAINDICATIONS</b>
<ul>
 	<li>DAYVIGO is contraindicated in patients with narcolepsy.</li>
</ul>
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressant Effects and Daytime Impairment:<br class=""dnr"" /><br class=""dnr"" /></b>DAYVIGO can impair daytime wakefulness. CNS depressant effects may persist in some patients up to several days after discontinuing DAYVIGO. Prescribers should advise patients about the potential for next-day somnolence.<br class=""dnr"" /> <br class=""dnr"" />Driving ability was impaired in some subjects taking DAYVIGO 10 mg. Risk of daytime impairment is increased if DAYVIGO is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining or at a higher than recommended dose. If taken in these circumstances, patients should not drive or engage in activities requiring mental alertness.<br class=""dnr"" /> <br class=""dnr"" />Use with other classes of CNS depressants increases the risk of CNS depression. Dosage adjustments of DAYVIGO and concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary when administered together. Use of DAYVIGO with other insomnia drugs is not recommended. Patients should be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with DAYVIGO.<br class=""dnr"" /> <br class=""dnr"" />Because DAYVIGO can cause drowsiness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at a higher risk of falls.</li>
 	<li><b>Sleep Paralysis, Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations, and Cataplexy-Like Symptoms: <br class=""dnr"" /></b>Sleep paralysis, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and symptoms similar to mild cataplexy can occur with the use of DAYVIGO. Prescribers should explain these events to patients.</li>
 	<li><b>Complex Sleep Behaviors:<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Complex sleep behaviors have been reported to occur with the use of hypnotics such as DAYVIGO. Events can occur in hypnotic-naïve and hypnotic-experienced persons. Patients usually do not remember these events. Complex sleep behaviors may occur following the first or any subsequent use of DAYVIGO, with or without the concomitant use of alcohol and other CNS depressants. Discontinue DAYVIGO immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior.</li>
 	<li><b>Patients with Compromised Respiratory Function:<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The effect of DAYVIGO on respiratory function should be considered for patients with compromised respiratory function. DAYVIGO has not been studied in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</li>
 	<li><b>Worsening of Depression/Suicidal Ideation:<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Incidence of suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior, as assessed by questionnaire, was 0.3% for DAYVIGO 10 mg, 0.4% for DAYVIGO 5 mg, and 0.2% for placebo. In primarily depressed patients treated with hypnotics, worsening of depression and suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides) have been reported. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required. Intentional overdose is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the lowest number of tablets that is feasible should be prescribed at any one time. The emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.</li>
 	<li><b>Need to Evaluate for Co-Morbid Diagnoses:<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient. Re-evaluate for comorbid conditions if insomnia persists or worsens after 7 to 10 days of treatment.</li>
</ul>
<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>
<ul>
 	<li>The most common adverse reaction (reported in 5% of patients treated with DAYVIGO and at least twice the rate of placebo) with DAYVIGO was somnolence (10% for DAYVIGO 10 mg, 7% for DAYVIGO 5 mg, 1% for placebo).</li>
</ul>
<b>DRUG INTERACTIONS</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>CYP3A inhibitors:</b> The maximum recommended dose of DAYVIGO is 5 mg no more than once per night when co-administered with weak CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid concomitant use of DAYVIGO with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors.</li>
 	<li><b>CYP3A inducers:</b> Avoid concomitant use of DAYVIGO with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers.</li>
</ul>
<b>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Pregnancy and Lactation:</b> There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women who are exposed to DAYVIGO during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients in the DAYVIGO pregnancy registry by calling 1-888-274-2378. There are no available data on DAYVIGO use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.<br class=""dnr"" /> <br class=""dnr"" />There are no data on the presence of lemborexant in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.  Infants exposed to DAYVIGO through breastmilk should be monitored for excess sedation.</li>
 	<li><b>Geriatric Use:</b> Exercise caution when using doses higher than 5 mg in patients =65 years old.</li>
 	<li><b>Renal impairment:</b> Patients with severe renal impairment may experience an increased risk of somnolence.</li>
 	<li><b>Hepatic impairment:</b> The maximum recommended dose of DAYVIGO is 5 mg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. DAYVIGO is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients with mild hepatic impairment may experience an increased risk of somnolence.</li>
</ul>
<b>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Controlled substance scheduling of DAYVIGO is pending review by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).</li>
 	<li>Because individuals with a history of abuse or addiction to alcohol or other drugs may be at increased risk for abuse and addiction to DAYVIGO, follow such patients carefully.</li>

<b>2.     About Sleep Disorders</b><b><sup> <br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>Population studies show that sleep disorders affect many more people worldwide than previously thought.<sup>3</sup> Insomnia symptoms affect approximately 30% of the adult population worldwide.<sup>4</sup> Insomnia disorder is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or both, despite an adequate opportunity to sleep, which can lead to daytime consequences, such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and irritability.<sup>5,6</sup>
Sleeping well is essential for good health, including brain health. Poor sleep is associated with a wide range of health consequences.<sup>5</sup>
Experimental studies in animals and humans provide evidence of associations between sleep and disease risk factors, diseases, and mortality.<sup>7</sup> Studies suggest an optimal sleep duration between seven and eight hours.<sup>8</sup>
Women are 1.4 times more likely than men to suffer from insomnia.<sup>9</sup> Older adults also have higher prevalence of insomnia; aging is often accompanied by changes in sleep patterns, including disrupted sleep, frequent waking, and early waking, that can lead to less sleep time.<sup>10</sup>

<p align=""center""><em>ZEJULA is a potential best-in-class PARP inhibitor for ovarian cancer patients due to its compelling clinical data<sup>1</sup>, once-daily dosing and pharmacokinetic properties</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>ZEJULA is the first approval for Zai Lab in Mainland China</em></p>
<p align=""left"">SHANGHAI, China and SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 27, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ: ZLAB), a China and U.S.-based innovative commercial stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved the New Drug Application (NDA) for ZEJULA (niraparib), an oral, once-daily poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor as maintenance therapy for adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. ZEJULA is a potent and highly selective PARP1/2 inhibitor that does not require BRCA mutation or other biomarker testing prior to administration.</p>
<p align=""left"">“The NMPA approval of ZEJULA, our first product to be approved in Mainland China, is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the entire Zai Lab team,” said Dr. Samantha Du, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Zai Lab. “We are grateful to all of the patients and investigators who contributed to the success of the ZEJULA clinical development program. Additionally, we appreciate the NMPA for their partnership through this rapid and thorough assessment of the ZEJULA application, recognizing the high unmet medical need it serves. As the first PARP inhibitor with Category 1 designation and manufactured in Mainland China, we are very excited to bring ZEJULA to Chinese patients following the successful launch in Hong Kong. With enrollment completed with 265 patients, we remain committed to finish our pivotal trial for maintenance therapy for Chinese patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (the NORA study) by third quarter of next year.”</p>
<p align=""left"">“The approval of ZEJULA in Mainland China is welcoming news for the ovarian cancer community, where advances in treatment have been very limited despite the clinical need,” said Dr. Xiaohua Wu, Professor and Chair of Gynecologic Oncology Department of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Centre. “The NOVA study shows that ZEJULA is a potential best-in-class PARP inhibitor for ovarian cancer patients, regardless of BRCA mutation or biomarker status, due to its compelling clinical data, convenience of once-daily dosing and attractive pharmacokinetic properties, including its ability to cross the blood brain barrier.”</p>
<p align=""left"">The Committee of Gynecological Oncology, Chinese Anti-Cancer Association (CACA) has updated its clinical practice guidelines in <em>Consensus of Chinese Experts on Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</em> to recommend ZEJULA (I/A category) as a maintenance treatment option for platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.</p>
<p align=""left"">“Ovarian cancer is a devastating disease with a 5-year survival rate that hasn’t improved in a decade,” said Dr. Lingying Wu, Director of the Department of Gynecologic Oncology of the Cancer Hospital of China Academy of Medical Sciences. “In addition to helping patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, ZEJULA’s recent PRIMA study demonstrated significant PFS improvement when given as monotherapy in women with first-line platinum responsive ovarian cancer, resulting in a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the overall study population. Clinically meaningful reduction in risk of disease progression or death was further demonstrated with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.40, 0.43 and 0.68 for BRCA mutant, HRD positive and HRD negative tumors, respectively. This study showed ZEJULA as the first PARP inhibitor to significantly improve PFS in this setting, regardless of biomarker status.”</p>
<p align=""left"">Zai Lab anticipates filing a supplemental NDA for ZEJULA (niraparib) with the NMPA as a first-line monotherapy maintenance treatment of platinum-responsive ovarian cancer patients soon after GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) files with the relevant global health authorities.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Ovarian cancer in China</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynecologic cancers in China with more than 52,000 newly diagnosed cases and 23,000 deaths in China each year. The 5-year overall survival rate of ovarian cancer patients is 46% across all stages, but only 29% in patients diagnosed with distant metastatic disease. While platinum-based chemotherapy is effective at inducing an initial response in ovarian cancer, the disease will recur in the majority of women. Effective treatment options for patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer remain limited. New agents that prolong the duration of response following platinum-based treatment and delay the inevitable relapse of ovarian cancer will benefit patients with ovarian cancer in China.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>About ZEJULA (niraparib)</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">ZEJULA (niraparib, ZL-2306) is a potential best-in-class PARP inhibitor for ovarian cancer patients due to its compelling clinical data<sup>1</sup>, once-daily dosing and pharmacokinetic properties, including its ability to cross the blood brain barrier. As maintenance therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer (the NOVA study), ZEJULA treatment reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 73% in patients with germline BRCA mutations (HR 0.27) and by 55% in patients without germline BRCA mutations (HR 0.45).</p>
<p align=""left"">Zai Lab also conducted a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study of niraparib in Chinese patients with ovarian cancer. This study was published in August 2019 in <em>The Oncologist</em> and demonstrated that the PK profile of niraparib in Chinese patients were comparable to that of patients evaluated in ZEJULA’s global PK study. Zai Lab in-licensed rights to ZEJULA from GSK for Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
<p align=""left"">The NDA was accepted by the NMPA on December 12, 2018 and granted priority review status on January 29, 2019. Zai Lab has now obtained approvals for marketing ZEJULA in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau for maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer.</p>
<p align=""left"">Since the Hong Kong launch of ZEJULA in October 2018, it has rapidly gained market share in the region despite being launched more than two years behind Lynparza<sup>®</sup>. Based on IQVIA (formerly IMS) data, ZEJULA is now the market leading PARP inhibitor with market share in Hong Kong of 77% by value in the third quarter of 2019.</p>
<p align=""left"">ZEJULA is also being evaluated in China in pivotal studies as first-line maintenance therapy in small-cell lung cancer.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">The most common side effects for patients taking ZEJULA include heart not beating regularly, nausea, constipation, vomiting, pain in the stomach area, mouth sores, diarrhea, indigestion or heartburn, dry mouth, tiredness, loss of appetite, urinary tract infection, shortness of breath, cough, rash, changes in liver function or other blood tests, pain in your joints, muscles, and back, headache, dizziness, change in the way food tastes, trouble sleeping, anxiety, sore throat and changes in the amount or color of your urine. Other potential serious side effects include bone marrow problems called Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or a type of blood cancer called Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), symptoms of low blood cell counts (which can be a sign of serious bone marrow problems) and high blood pressures. Patients should take a few medical tests before they are treated with ZEJULA. Healthcare providers should periodically monitor their patients’ blood cell counts and blood pressures.</p>

<h3><b><i>Lynparza reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47% in patients
whose disease had not progressed on at least 16 weeks of a 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen</i></b></h3>
<h3><b><i>Only PARP inhibitor approved in germline BRCA-mutated
metastatic pancreatic cancer</i></b>.</h3>
AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced that <i>Lynparza </i>(olaparib) has been approved in the US for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (pancreatic cancer) whose disease has not progressed on at least 16 weeks of a 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients will be selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for <i>Lynparza</i>.
The approval follows the <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/lynparza-recommended-by-fda-advisory-committee-for-1st-line-maintenance-treatment-of-germline-brca-mutated-metastatic-pancreatic-cancer.html"">recommendation</a> from the US FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) on 17 December for <i>Lynparza </i>in this indication, and was based on results from the pivotal <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2019/lynparza-nearly-doubled-the-time-patients-lived-without-disease-progression-from-germline-brca-mutated-metastatic-pancreatic-cancer02062019-2.html"">Phase III POLO trial</a> published in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1903387"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a><i> </i>and presented at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting<i>.</i>
Results showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival, where <i>Lynparza</i> nearly doubled the time patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer lived without disease progression or death to a median of 7.4 months vs. 3.8 months on placebo. The safety and tolerability profile of <i>Lynparza </i>in the POLO trial was in line with that observed in prior clinical trials.
Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer historically have faced poor outcomes due to the aggressive nature of the disease and limited treatment advances over the last few decades. <i>Lynparza</i> is now the only approved targeted medicine in biomarker-selected patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.”
Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “<i>Lynparza</i> embodies MSD’s and AstraZeneca’s commitment to advance the treatment of challenging types of cancer, including metastatic pancreatic cancer. The expanded approval of <i>Lynparza</i> represents a significant milestone for patients and supports the value of germline BRCA testing in patients with this disease.”
Hedy L. Kindler, Co-Principal Investigator of the POLO trial and Professor of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, said: “Today’s approval of olaparib based on the POLO results gives clinicians an important 1st-line maintenance treatment option which nearly doubled the progression-free survival benefit in patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer.”
Julie Fleshman, President and CEO, Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, said: “Metastatic pancreatic cancer patients have been waiting a long time for new therapy options for their devastating disease. Today’s approval of <i>Lynparza</i> provides an exciting new treatment option for patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer.”
The <a href=""https://www.pancan.org/"" rel=""link-confirmation"">Pancreatic Cancer Action Network</a> (PanCAN) is a US-based organisation that supports and advocates on behalf of the patients, caregivers and communities affected by pancreatic cancer.
<b>About pancreatic cancer</b>
Pancreatic cancer is a deadly cancer with a high unmet medical need. It is the 12th most commonly occurring cancer<sup>2 </sup>and the 7th leading cause of cancer death globally.<sup>3</sup> The disease has the lowest survival rate of the most common cancers<sup>4,5</sup> and is the only major cancer with a single-digit five-year survival rate (2-9%) in nearly every country.<sup>5</sup> There were approximately 460,000 new cases worldwide in 2018<sup>6.</sup> As there are often no symptoms, or symptoms may be non-specific in the early stages<sup>7</sup>, it is most commonly diagnosed at an incurable stage.<sup>8 </sup>Around 80% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed when the disease has metastasised and for these the average survival is less than a year.<sup>9</sup> Despite advances in treatment<sup>10</sup>, few improvements have been made in diagnosis and treatment over the decades.<sup>11,12</sup> Current treatment is surgery (for which approximately only 10-20% of patients are eligible), chemotherapy and radiotherapy, highlighting a critical unmet medical need for more effective treatment options.<sup>13</sup>
<b>About POLO</b>
POLO is a Phase III randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial of <i>Lynparza</i> tablets (300mg twice daily) as maintenance monotherapy vs. placebo. The trial randomised 154 patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progressed on 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomised (3:2) to receive <i>Lynparza</i> or placebo until disease progression. The primary endpoint was PFS and key secondary endpoints included overall survival, time to second disease progression, overall response rate and health-related quality of life.<sup>1</sup>
The results showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival, where <i>Lynparza</i> nearly doubled the time patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer lived without disease progression or death to a median of 7.4 months vs. 3.8 months on placebo and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47% (HR 0.53 [95% CI, 0.35-0.81], p=0.0035). The benefit of maintenance with <i>Lynparza </i>was seen consistently across a range of clinically meaningful endpoints. In patients with measurable disease at baseline, 23% responded to <i>Lynparza </i>vs.12% on placebo (odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 0.89 to 6.76) and had a median duration of treatment in excess of two years (24.9 months; 95% CI, 14.8 to could not be calculated) vs 3.7 months on placebo (95% CI, 2.1 to could not be calculated). Overall survival (OS), a secondary endpoint, at interim analysis was 18.9 months for <i>Lynparza</i> vs. 18.1 months for placebo but did not reach statistical significance (HR=0.90; p=0.68).
The safety and tolerability profile of <i>Lynparza</i> in the POLO trial was in line with that observed in prior clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions (ARs) =10% were fatigue (60%), nausea (45%), abdominal pain (34%), diarrhoea (29%), anaemia (27%), decreased appetite (25%), constipation (23%), vomiting (20%), back pain (19%), arthralgia (15%), rash (15%), thrombocytopenia (14%), dyspnoea (13%), nasopharyngitis (12%), neutropenia (12%), dysgeusia (11%) and stomatitis (10%). Grade 3 or above ARs were anaemia (11%), fatigue (5%), neutropenia (4%), decreased appetite (3%), thrombocytopenia (3%), abdominal pain (2%), vomiting (1%) and arthralgia (1%). ARs led to dose reduction in 23% of patients on <i>Lynparza </i>while 6% of patients discontinued treatment.
Based on the results of POLO, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines were updated in July 2019 to recommend <i>Lynparza </i>as maintenance treatment for gBRCAm pancreatic cancer.<sup>14</sup>
In the US, eligible metastatic pancreatic cancer patients will be selected for therapy based on the FDA-approved companion diagnostic, BRACAnalysis CDx, a genetic test that detects the presence of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. BRACAnalysis CDx is owned and commercialised by Myriad Genetics, Inc.
<b>About BRCA mutations</b>
BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility genes 1/2) are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role in maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.
<b>About <i>Lynparza</i></b>
<i>Lynparza</i> (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with <i>Lynparza</i> leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. <i>Lynparza</i> is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.
<i>Lynparza</i> is currently approved in 65 countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance
treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, regardless of BRCA status. It is
approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in 44 countries, including the US and Japan, for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in other jurisdictions for ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancers.
<i>Lynparza</i>, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, is approved for advanced ovarian cancer and metastatic breast cancer and has been used in over 25,000 patients worldwide. <i>Lynparza</i> has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. <i>Lynparza</i> is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.
<b>About the AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration</b>
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise <i>Lynparza</i>, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

<p class=""subtitle"">LIBRETTO-531 is first ever Phase 3 trial in RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer</p>
<p class=""subtitle"">- Randomized trial will examine selpercatinib against standard of care in 400 patients with advanced or metastatic treatment-naïve RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer.</p>
<span class=""xn-location"">INDIANAPOLIS</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Dec. 30, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lilly-opens-phase-3-clinical-trial-in-ret-mutant-medullary-thyroid-cancer-300979626.html#financial-modal"">LLY</a>) today announced the opening of the LIBRETTO-531 clinical trial <span id=""spanHghlt334d"">[NCT04211337]</span> for selpercatinib, also known as LOXO-292, for treatment-naïve <i>RET</i>-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) patients. This is the second Phase 3 trial to open for selpercatinib, a highly selective and potent, oral investigational new medicine in clinical development for the treatment of patients with cancers that harbor abnormalities in the rearranged during transfection (RET) kinase. Enrolled trial participants will be randomized to receive either selpercatinib or physician's choice of cabozantinib or vandetanib as initial treatment of their advanced or metastatic <i>RET</i>-mutant MTC.
""Approximately 60 percent of people with medullary thyroid cancer have an activating <i>RET </i>point mutation, yet the current therapeutic options are not ideal for many patients,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Lori Wirth</span>, MD, medical director of the Center for Head and Neck Cancer, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. ""This Phase 3 trial of selpercatinib in patients with advanced or metastatic <i>RET</i>-mutant MTC seeks to confirm a new standard of care that we hope will provide a more effective treatment option for this patient population.""
""While medullary thyroid cancer is rare, the occurrence of <i>RET </i>mutations in MTC is high,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Gary Bloom</span>, executive director for ThyCa: Thyroid Cancer Survivors' Association, Inc. ""For that reason, we are very excited about the opening of this Phase 3 trial because it shows promise for patients with advanced and metastatic <i>RET</i>-mutant MTC. Due to new treatment options, it is imperative that MTC patients discuss with their medical doctors if and when they should undergo genomic testing of their tumors. This will ensure that people with <i>RET</i> tissue mutations have access to potential treatments and clinical trials such as this one for selpercatinib.""
<b>Trial Background<br class=""dnr"" /></b>LIBRETTO-531 is a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of patients with treatment-naïve <i>RET-</i>mutant MTC. The trial will enroll 400 patients with advanced or metastatic <i>RET</i>-mutant MTC who have received no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Enrolled trial participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive either selpercatinib or physician's choice of cabozantinib or vandetanib as initial treatment of their advanced or metastatic <i>RET</i>-mutant MTC. <i>RET</i> mutations may be identified using local testing. This trial's efficacy endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS), treatment failure-free survival (TFFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DoR). For patients randomized to the control arm, crossover is allowed at progression.
<b>About </b><b>Selpercatinib (LOXO-292)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Selpercatinib, also known as LOXO-292, is a highly selective and potent, oral investigational new medicine in clinical development for the treatment of patients with cancers that harbor abnormalities in the rearranged during transfection (RET) kinase. <i>RET</i> fusions and mutations occur across multiple tumor types with varying frequency. Selpercatinib was designed to inhibit native RET signaling as well as anticipated acquired resistance mechanisms.
Selpercatinib has received breakthrough designations in <i>RET</i> fusion-positive NSCLC, <i>RET</i>-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and <i>RET</i> fusion-positive thyroid cancers.
<b>About </b><b><i>RET</i></b><b>-Altered Cancers<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Genomic alterations in RET kinase, which include fusions and activating point mutations, lead to overactive RET signaling and uncontrolled cell growth. <i>RET</i> fusions have been identified in approximately 2 percent of non-small cell lung cancer, 10-20 percent of papillary and other thyroid cancers and a subset of other cancers. Activating <i>RET</i> point mutations account for approximately 60 percent of MTC. <i>RET</i> fusion cancers and <i>RET</i>-mutant MTC are primarily dependent on this single activated kinase for their proliferation and survival. This dependency, often referred to as ""oncogene addiction,"" renders such tumors highly susceptible to small molecule inhibitors targeting RET.

 	<li><em>Second BeiGene-discovered drug to receive regulatory approval, first in China
</em></li>
 	<li><em>Tislelizumab is an anti–PD-1 antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc?R on macrophages</em></li>
</ul>
BEIJING, China and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 27, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative molecularly-targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer, today announced that its anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab has received approval from the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) as a treatment for patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL) who have received at least two prior therapies. The new drug application (NDA) was previously granted priority review by the NMPA. Following the recent approval of BRUKINSA™ (zanubrutinib) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), tislelizumab is BeiGene’s first drug approved in China.
Developed by BeiGene scientists, tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc?R, which is believed to play an essential role in activating phagocytosis in macrophages to minimize its negative impact on T effector cells.
“We’ve been working to develop improved therapies for cancer patients around the world. The discovery of immunotherapy revolutionized the cancer treatment paradigm and has since brought new treatment options and hope to people with cancer,” commented John V. Oyler, Chairman, Co-Founder, and CEO of BeiGene. “Tislelizumab is a differentiated anti-PD-1 antibody and has demonstrated encouraging clinical efficacy and safety in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL. We look forward to its further development in a broad array of solid tumors and hematological malignancies.”
Professor Jun Zhu, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Lymphoma Department at Beijing Cancer Hospital commented, “Anti-PD-1 antibodies are becoming a new treatment option for lymphoma patients. With a complete response rate of more than 60%, BeiGene’s tislelizumab has demonstrated significant efficacy and a good safety profile as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL. The approval of tislelizumab will bring a meaningful treatment option for those patients with cHL in China.”
“Currently, BeiGene is conducting 15 registration-enabling clinical trials to evaluate tislelizumab in 23 countries and regions globally in prevalent cancer types such as lung, liver, esophageal and gastric cancers, with over 4,800 patients enrolled to date in its broad development program. We are grateful to the dedicated clinicians and particularly the patients who participated in these clinical studies,” said Wendy Yan, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Regulatory Affairs at BeiGene.
In addition, a supplementary new drug application (sNDA) for tislelizumab in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma has been accepted and granted priority review by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) at the NMPA.
Tislelizumab is a biologic product approved under the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) pilot program in China, and will be manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim at its facility in Shanghai as the commercial supplier. Established in 1885, Boehringer Ingelheim has over 35 years of biotechnology experience, and with more than 3,600 employees and a global network its contract biopharmaceutical manufacturing business has helped to bring more than 30 molecules to the market globally.
The NMPA approval is based on the clinical results from a single-arm, multi-center, pivotal Phase 2 trial BGB-A317-203 (NCT03209973). Among the patients who were evaluable for responses, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months and a median follow-up of 14 months, the independent review committee (IRC)-assessed objective response rate (ORR) was 76.9% and the complete response (CR) rate was 61.5%.
In the R/R cHL trial BGB-A317-203, the most common adverse reactions (= 10%) reported were pyrexia, hypothyroidism, weight increase, pruritus, decreased white blood cell count, upper respiratory tract infection, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), rash, decreased neutrophil count, cough, fatigue, and increased blood bilirubin. Grade 3 and above adverse reactions occurring in = 2% of patients included pneumonitis, weight increase, severe skin reactions and hypertension. There was no fatal adverse reaction case reported from BGB-A317-203.
Like other immune checkpoint inhibitors, tislelizumab could cause immune- related adverse events (irAE) that mainly include pneumonitis, diarrhea and colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and other thyroid disorders, adrenocortical insufficiency, hyperglycemia and type 1 diabetes mellitus) and skin adverse reactions. Occasionally, nephritis, pancreatitis, myocarditis and other irAE were also reported.
The recommended dose of tislelizumab is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion every three weeks, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
BeiGene is currently working with Boehringer Ingelheim to prepare for the commercial supply to launch of tislelizumab in China.
<strong>About Classical Hodgkin’s Lymphoma</strong>
Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a group of malignancies that affects the lymph nodes and the tissues of the lymphatic system. The most common form is classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL), which accounts for 95% of all Hodgkin’s lymphoma incidences<sup>1</sup>. It is most commonly diagnosed in young adults between the ages of 15 and 35 and in older adults over age 55<sup>2</sup>. Enlarged lymph nodes are typically the initial symptom, but cancer cells can be detected in liver, spleen, and bone marrow in late stage disease. Although first-line chemo-radiotherapy has demonstrated significant improvement in the survival of patients with cHL, patients with primary refractory disease (approximately 5-10%) or those who relapse after responding to initial treatment (approximately 10-30%), usually have poor prognosis and traditional treatments have shown limited efficacy, representing an unmet medical need.
<strong>About Tislelizumab</strong>
Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is a humanized IgG4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc?R on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to Fc?R on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Tislelizumab is the first drug from BeiGene’s immuno-oncology biologics program and is being developed as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers.
Tislelizumab is approved by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) as a treatment for patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma who received at least two prior therapies. A supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for tislelizumab in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma has been granted priority review by the Center for Drug Evaluation at the NMPA and is currently under review.
Tislelizumab will be manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim at its facility in Shanghai as the commercial supplier. Following required qualifications and approvals, BeiGene plans to provide additional commercial supply through its commercial-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, which completed its initial phase of construction in September this year.
<p align=""justify"">Tislelizumab is being studied in a broad clinical program as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers. Currently, 15 registration-enabling clinical trials are being conducted in China and globally, including 11 Phase 3 trials and four pivotal Phase 2 trials.</p>
Tislelizumab is not approved for use outside China.

BEIJING--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, today announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase III trial of SCB-808, a proposed biosimilar to Enbrel<sup>®</sup> (etanercept) being developed in the prefilled syringe formulation for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“More importantly, we hope that SCB-808 will meaningfully impact the lives of many patients in China who suffer from autoimmune diseases, and the initiation of this Phase III trial brings us one step closer to this goal.”</p>
<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191230005088/en/Clover-Biopharmaceuticals-Initiates-Phase-III-Study-Etanercept#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
The Phase III, multi-center trial in China is designed to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of SCB-808 and originator drug Enbrel<sup>®</sup> in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) via<i> </i>subcutaneous administration.
“The treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and other rheumatic diseases remains a high unmet medical need in China, as the majority of patients remain severely undertreated. Currently, the lack of affordable, convenient and high-quality biologics therapies presents a major hurdle to wide patient adoption and compliance,” said Dr. Feng Huang of Beijing 301 Hospital and leading principal investigator of this trial. “My team and I look forward to evaluating SCB-808 as a potential new and convenient therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases in China.”
“We are excited to work with Dr. Huang and these world-class investigators and sites participating in this study,” said Dr. Min Dong, Executive Vice President, Global Clinical Development at Clover. “More importantly, we hope that SCB-808 will meaningfully impact the lives of many patients in China who suffer from autoimmune diseases, and the initiation of this Phase III trial brings us one step closer to this goal.”
Currently available etanercept biosimilars in China were all developed and approved prior to the implementation of the CFDA’s <i>Technical Guideline for Development and Evaluation of Biosimilars</i> and were not compared to the originator drug Enbrel<sup>®</sup> in clinical trials to demonstrate their bioequivalence. Furthermore, they are currently only approved in the lyophilized powder formulation, which must be reconstituted typically by trained medical personnel before being subcutaneously injected into patients. SCB-808 is being developed in the prefilled syringe formulation, which is ready-for-injection and can potentially be self-administered by patients in the convenience of their own homes. Thus, in the Western world, ready-for-injection formulations constitute the overwhelming majority of Enbrel<sup>®</sup> prescriptions. As such, Clover’s SCB-808 has the potential to address the unmet needs of Chinese patients for this class of drugs.
“Having compared SCB-808 to both Enbrel<sup>®</sup> and other Chinese etanercept biosimilars in preclinical studies, we believe that the advantages of our robust biomanufacturing process, head-to-head comparisons to Enbrel<sup>®</sup> in clinical trials and the convenient ready-for-injection prefilled syringe formulation will allow us to potentially have meaningful commercial advantages once SCB-808 is brought to the market,” said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. “With a new state-of-the-art 35,000m<sup>2</sup> cGMP biomanufacturing facility, with initial 2 x 2,000L bioreactor capacity and further expandable, Clover certainly has the vision and capacity to make a positive impact on the millions of suffering autoimmune patients in China.”

Planegg/Munich, Germany, December 30, 2019
<b>MorphoSys Announces Submission of Biologics License Application for Tafasitamab in r/r DLBCL to the FDA</b>
&nbsp;
MorphoSys AG (FSE: MOR; Prime Standard Segment; MDAX &amp; TecDAX; NASDAQ: MOR) announced today that it has submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for tafasitamab, an anti-CD19 antibody, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL). The BLA submission is based on the primary analysis data from the L-MIND trial of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in patients with r/r DLBCL and the retrospective observational matched control cohort Re-MIND evaluating efficacy outcomes of r/r DLBCL patients who received lenalidomide monotherapy.
""The BLA submission marks a significant milestone in MorphoSys' history and demonstrates our dedication to address the high medical need in relapsed or refractory DLBCL,"" said Dr. Malte Peters, Chief Development Officer of MorphoSys. ""If approved, tafasitamab and lenalidomide could become an alternative treatment option for patients with this serious disease.""
The FDA has a 60-day filing review period to determine whether the BLA is complete and acceptable for filing. MorphoSys will communicate the agency's decision.
<u>About L-MIND</u>
L-MIND is a single arm, open-label phase 2 study, investigating the combination of tafasitamab and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) after up to two prior lines of therapy, including an anti-CD20 targeting therapy (e.g. rituximab), who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation. The study's primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcome measures include duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In May 2019, the study reached its primary completion. Primary analysis data with a cut-off date of November 30, 2018 included 80 patients enrolled into the trial who had received tafasitamab and lenalidomide and had been followed-up as per protocol for at least one year. Efficacy results in this update were based on response rates assessed by an independent review committee for all 80 patients. Based on earlier reported interim data from L-MIND, in October 2017 the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tafasitamab plus lenalidomide in this patient population.
<u>About Re-MIND</u>
Re-MIND, an observational retrospective study, was designed to isolate the contribution of tafasitamab in the combination with lenalidomide and to prove the combinatorial effect. The study compares real-world response data of patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who received lenalidomide monotherapy with the efficacy outcomes of the tafasitamab-lenalidomide combination, as investigated in MorphoSys's L-MIND trial. Re-MIND collected the efficacy data from 490 r/r DLBCL patients in the U.S. and EU. Qualification criteria for matching patients of both studies were pre-specified. As a result, 76 eligible Re-MIND patients were identified and matched 1:1 to 76 of 80 L-MIND patients based on important baseline characteristics. Objective response rates (ORR) were validated based on this subset of 76 patients in Re-MIND and L-MIND, respectively. The primary endpoint of Re-MIND has been met and shows a statistically significant superior best ORR of the tafasitamab/lenalidomide combination compared to lenalidomide monotherapy.
<u>About tafasitamab (MOR208)</u>
Tafasitamab (MOR208) is an investigational humanized Fc-engineered monoclonal antibody directed against CD19. Fc-modification of tafasitamab is intended to lead to a significant potentiation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), thus aiming to improve a key mechanism of tumor cell killing. Tafasitamab has been observed in preclinical models to induce direct apoptosis by binding to CD19, which is assumed to be involved in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling.
MorphoSys is clinically investigating tafasitamab as a therapeutic option in B cell malignancies in a number of ongoing combination trials. An open-label phase 2 combination trial (L-MIND study) is investigating the safety and efficacy of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Based on interim data from L-MIND, in October 2017 the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tafasitamab plus lenalidomide in this patient population. Re-MIND, the real-world data lenalidomide alone matched control cohort met its primary endpoint in October 2019, demonstrating clinical superiority of the tafasitamab/lenalidomide combination compared to lenalidomide alone. The ongoing phase 3 study B-MIND assesses the combination of tafasitamab and bendamustine versus rituximab and bendamustine in r/r DLBCL. In addition, tafasitamab is currently being investigated in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL after discontinuation of a prior Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy (e.g. ibrutinib) in combination with idelalisib or venetoclax.

<p align=""justify"">NEW YORK, Dec. 30, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: AXSM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that AXS-07, Axsome’s novel, oral, multi-mechanistic investigational medicine for the acute treatment of migraine, met the two regulatory co-primary endpoints and significantly improved migraine pain and most bothersome symptoms as compared to placebo in the MOMENTUM Phase 3 trial. AXS-07 also met the key secondary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant superiority to the active comparator rizatriptan on sustained freedom from migraine pain.</p>
<p align=""justify"">MOMENTUM was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial which enrolled only patients with a history of inadequate response to prior acute migraine treatments, assessed using the Migraine Treatment Optimization Questionnaire (mTOQ-4). A total of 1,594 patients were randomized in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to AXS-07 (20 mg MoSEIC™ meloxicam/10 mg rizatriptan), rizatriptan (10 mg), MoSEIC™ meloxicam (20 mg), or placebo, to treat a single migraine attack of moderate or severe intensity. In addition to a history of inadequate response, enrolled patients exhibited a high rate of characteristics that are strongly associated with poor treatment outcomes including cutaneous allodynia (75.4%), severe migraine pain intensity (41.2%), obesity (43.7%), and morning migraine (36.6%). The study was conducted pursuant to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). Rizatriptan, an active comparator in the trial, is considered to be the fastest acting oral triptan and one of the most effective medications currently available for the acute treatment of migraine [1].</p>
<p align=""justify"">AXS-07 met the two regulatory co-primary endpoints by demonstrating, with high statistical significance, a greater percentage of patients as compared to placebo achieving pain freedom (19.9% versus 6.7%, p&lt;0.001) and absence of most bothersome symptom (36.9% versus 24.4%, p=0.002), 2 hours after dosing. Superiority of AXS-07 to rizatriptan and MoSEIC™ meloxicam (component contribution) was established as specified in the SPA, by demonstration of a greater percentage of AXS-07 patients achieving sustained pain freedom from 2 to 24 hours after dosing, compared to rizatriptan and MoSEIC™ meloxicam, as well as to placebo (16.1%, 11.2%, 8.8% and 5.3%, respectively; p=0.038, p=0.001, and p&lt;0.001, respectively versus AXS-07). The positive results on both co-primary endpoints along with the demonstration of component contribution support the filing of an NDA for AXS-07 in the acute treatment of migraine.</p>
<p align=""justify"">AXS-07 provided substantially greater and more sustained migraine pain relief compared to placebo and rizatriptan, which translated to a significant reduction in rescue medication use for AXS-07 compared to placebo and rizatriptan. The percentage of patients experiencing sustained pain relief from 2 to 24 hours after dosing was 53.3% for AXS-07, compared to 33.5% for placebo and 43.9% for rizatriptan (p&lt;0.001, p=0.006, respectively versus AXS-07). Sustained pain relief from 2 to 48 hours was also experienced by a statistically significantly greater proportion of AXS-07 patients (46.5%), compared to placebo (31.1%) and rizatriptan (36.5%) patients (p&lt;0.001, p=0.003, respectively versus AXS-07). Rescue medication was used by 23.0% of AXS-07 patients, compared to 43.5% of placebo and 34.7% of rizatriptan patients (p&lt;0.001 for each group versus AXS-07).</p>
<p align=""justify"">AXS-07 provided rapid relief of migraine pain with the percentage of patients achieving pain relief with AXS-07 being numerically greater than with rizatriptan at every time point measured starting at 15 minutes, and statistically significantly greater than with rizatriptan by 60 minutes (p=0.04). The proportions of patients experiencing pain relief 1.5 hours after dosing were 60.5% for AXS-07 compared to 52.5% for rizatriptan and 48.3% for placebo (p=0.019, p=0.004, respectively versus AXS-07). AXS-07 was statistically significantly superior to rizatriptan on several other secondary endpoints including Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) (p=0.022), and return to normal functioning at 24 hours (p=0.027).</p>
<p align=""justify"">“In the MOMENTUM trial, AXS-07 provided greater and more lasting migraine pain relief than rizatriptan. Given that rizatriptan is one of the most effective triptans and that the study enrolled patients with difficult-to-treat migraine, this finding is impressive,” said Richard B. Lipton, M.D., Professor and Vice Chair of Neurology, and Director of the Montefiore Headache Center, at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. “Many patients experience a suboptimal response to their current acute migraine treatments, placing them at increased risk of headache related disability and progression to chronic migraine, factors associated with increased healthcare costs. The results of this study suggest that AXS-07 may provide an important treatment option for people with difficult-to-treat migraine.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">AXS-07 was safe and well tolerated in the trial. The most commonly reported adverse events with AXS-07 were nausea, dizziness and somnolence, none of which occurred at a rate greater than placebo or greater than 3%. There was one serious adverse event in the AXS-07 arm which was deemed by the investigator not to be related to study drug.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The results of MOMENTUM demonstrate the ability of AXS-07 to provide unique benefits to migraine patients, with fast, strong, and durable relief of migraine pain as compared to a potent active comparator in a stringently designed trial enriched with patients with difficult-to-treat migraine,” said Herriot Tabuteau, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Axsome. “These data have potentially important implications for patient care based on the high rate of inadequate response to and patient dissatisfaction with current treatments. With these positive results, we look forward to filing an NDA for AXS-07 in the acute treatment of migraine in 2020.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The MOMENTUM study was conducted pursuant to an SPA with the FDA. The SPA provides agreement that the overall MOMENTUM trial design (e.g., entry criteria, dose selection, endpoints) and planned analysis adequately address objectives that, if met, will support the regulatory submission for approval of AXS-07 for the indication of acute treatment of migraine in adults with or without aura. Based on FDA feedback, Axsome believes that MOMENTUM will be the only efficacy trial required to support an NDA filing for AXS-07 for the acute treatment of migraine. Axsome plans to file the NDA in the second half of 2020.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The World Health Organization categorizes the disability from severe migraine attacks on the same level as that from quadriplegia, dementia, and acute psychosis. The debilitating pain of migraine damages family life, social life and employment,” said Cedric O’Gorman, MD, Senior Vice President of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs of Axsome. “AXS-07 incorporates multiple mechanisms of action to address various migraine processes with the goal of providing enhanced effectiveness. The results of the MOMENTUM trial validate this approach, demonstrating that AXS-07 can provide significant benefit that is greater than that of currently available treatment, even in patients with difficult-to-treat migraine.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">AXS-07 is a novel, oral, rapidly absorbed, multi-mechanistic investigational medicine for the acute treatment of migraine, consisting of MoSEIC™ meloxicam and rizatriptan. AXS-07 is thought to act by inhibiting CGRP release, reversing CGRP-mediated vasodilation, and inhibiting neuro-inflammation, pain signal transmission, and central sensitization. Axsome’s MoSEIC™ technology significantly increases the speed of absorption of the meloxicam component after oral administration while maintaining a long plasma half-life. AXS-07 is covered by 21 issued U.S. and international patents providing protection out to 2036, and Axsome maintains worldwide rights.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Detailed study results, including additional secondary endpoints, will be submitted for presentation at upcoming medical meetings and for publication. AXS-07 is also being evaluated in the INTERCEPT Phase 3 trial which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the early treatment of migraine with AXS-07. In contrast to the ongoing MOMENTUM trial in which patients with a history of inadequate response treated migraine attacks once they have become of moderate or severe intensity, in the INTERCEPT trial, patients are to administer AXS-07 at the earliest sign of migraine pain.</p>

<p align=""justify""><strong>About the MOMENTUM Trial</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">MOMENTUM (Maximizing Outcomes in Treating Acute Migraine) was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of AXS-07 in the acute treatment of moderate and severe migraine. Eligible patients must have had a history of inadequate response to prior acute migraine treatments, assessed using the Migraine Treatment Optimization Questionnaire (mTOQ-4). A total of 1,594 patients were randomized in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to treatment with AXS-07, rizatriptan, MoSEIC™ meloxicam, or placebo. The two co-primary endpoints of the trial were the proportion of patients who are free from headache pain two hours after dosing, and the proportion of patients who no longer suffered from their most bothersome migraine-associated symptom (nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia) two hours after dosing, for AXS-07 as compared to placebo. Superiority of AXS-07 to the rizatriptan and MoSEIC™ meloxicam arms (component contribution) was to be established based on sustained freedom from headache pain from two to 24 hours after dosing (key secondary endpoint). The MOMENTUM study was conducted pursuant to an FDA Special Protocol Assessment (SPA).</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Migraine</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Over 37 million Americans suffer from migraine according to the Centers for Disease Control, and it is the leading cause of disability among neurological disorders in the United States according to the American Migraine Foundation. Migraine is characterized by recurrent attacks of pulsating, often severe and disabling head pain associated with nausea, and sensitivity to light and or sound. It is estimated that migraine accounts for $78 billion in direct (e.g. doctor visits, medications) and indirect (e.g. missed work, lost productivity) costs each year in the United States [5]. Published surveys of migraine sufferers indicate that more than 70% are not fully satisfied with their current treatment, that nearly 80% would try a new therapy, and that they desire treatments that work faster, more consistently, and result in less symptom recurrence [6,7].</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About AXS-07</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">AXS-07 is a novel, oral, investigational medicine with distinct dual mechanisms of action under development for the acute treatment of migraine. AXS-07 consists of MoSEIC™ meloxicam and rizatriptan. Meloxicam is a new molecular entity for migraine enabled by Axsome’s MoSEIC (Molecular Solubility Enhanced Inclusion Complex) technology, which results in rapid absorption of meloxicam while maintaining a long plasma half-life. Meloxicam is a COX-2 preferential non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and rizatriptan is a 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> agonist. AXS-07 is designed to provide rapid, enhanced and consistent relief of migraine, with reduced symptom recurrence. AXS-07 is not approved by the FDA.</p>

On December 30, 2019, Aridis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) announced the development of a novel monoclonal antibody (“mAb”)
discovery, antibody production and yield maximizing technology called APEX
TM and a collaboration with Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc, a company
incorporated in the U.S. (“MappBio”).
APEX
TM is a technology suite comprising of a monoclonal antibody discovery platform technology that enables the screening and single cell
cloning of antibody producing B-cells using microarrays (‘APEX
TM NanoArrays’), a proprietary mAb cell line technology called BREATH
TM CHO that
enables gene editing-assisted gene swapping of the candidate antibody genes with endogenous versions to generate a high mAb productivity cell line, and a
gene editing-based technology to activate endogenous genes in antibody production cell lines to increase mAb production. A schematic representation of
APEX
TM is shown in figure below
APEX
TM builds upon the Company’s original hybridoma-based technology platform, MabIgX
®, which allows for rapid fusion and production of
mAbs directly from patients antibody-producing B-cells.
MappBio agreed to enter into research collaborations with the Company whereby the Company will apply its APEX
TM technology to develop mAb
productivity enhanced versions of an undisclosed number of CHO cell lines that were originally developed by MappBio.

</ul>
NESS ZIONA, Israel, Dec. 30, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Sol-Gel Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ: SLGL) today announced top-line results from two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for Twyneo®, an investigational, combination of microencapsulated tretinoin 0.1% and microencapsulated benzoyl peroxide 3% cream, which demonstrated statistically significant improvement on all co-primary endpoints in the treatment of patients with acne vulgaris. Twyneo was also found to be well-tolerated.
The primary endpoints for both trials included: the proportion of patients who succeeded in achieving at least a two grade reduction from baseline and Clear (grade 0) or Almost Clear (grade 1) at Week 12 on a 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale; an absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion count at Week 12; and an absolute change from baseline in non-inflammatory lesion count at Week 12.
“We are excited to share these robust results which further demonstrate the potential of our microencapsulation technology to deliver first-of-its kind efficacy in a topical acne treatment,” said Dr. Alon Seri-Levy, Chief Executive Officer of Sol-Gel. “We thank the patients and investigators involved in the Twyneo trials. We look forward to submitting our NDA in the second half of 2020 and to working with the FDA through their review of our application, with a view to making Twyneo available to physicians and patients in the second half of 2021.”
If approved, Twyneo has the potential to be the first acne vulgaris treatment to bring together benzoyl peroxide and a potent retinoid, tretinoin, in a once-daily cream – enabled using the Company’s proprietary microencapsulation technology.
“Twyneo combines, for the first time, two of the safest and most effective topical agents available for the treatment of acne into a single application.  Due to stability issues these products don’t play well together and we were never able to recommend even consecutive co-application of the two agents; Sol-Gel’s technology has solved that,” said Hilary Baldwin, M.D., Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson School of Medicine, Medical Director, The Acne Treatment and Research Center, Past President the American Acne and Rosacea Society. “The data presented today show that this unique formulation offers superior efficacy without compromising tolerability in a very convenient treatment. I believe physicians will look forward to adding Twyneo to their acne treatments toolbox.”
<strong>SGT-65-04 and SGT-65-05 Trials Design</strong>
To assess the efficacy and safety of Twyneo, 858 subjects, aged nine and older, with moderate-to-severe acne were enrolled in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled trials (SGT-65-04 and SGT-65-05) at 63 sites across the U.S. Subjects were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to be treated once-daily with either Twyneo (n=571) or vehicle cream (n=287) for 12 weeks. The co-primary endpoints for both trials included: the proportion of patients who succeeded in achieving at least a two grade reduction from baseline and Clear (grade 0) or Almost Clear (grade 1) at Week 12 on a 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale; an absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion count at Week 12; and an absolute change from baseline in non-inflammatory lesion count at Week 12.
<strong>Co-Primary Endpoint Results (Intention-to-Treat Population)</strong>
In trial SGT-65-04, 38.5% of patients treated with Twyneo achieved success in IGA versus 11.5% in the vehicle treated group (P&lt;0.001). In trial SGT-65-05, 25.4% of patients treated with Twyneo achieved success in IGA versus 14.7% in the vehicle group (P=0.017).
In trial SGT-65-04, the absolute change from baseline of inflammatory lesion count for Twyneo was -21.6 versus -14.8 for the vehicle group (P&lt;0.001). In trial SGT-65-05, the absolute change from baseline of inflammatory lesion count for Twyneo was -16.2 versus -14.1 for the vehicle group (P=0.021).
In trial SGT-65-04, the absolute change from baseline of non-inflammatory lesion count for Twyneo was -29.7 versus -19.8 for the vehicle group (P&lt;0.001). In trial SGT-65-05, the absolute change from baseline of non-inflammatory lesion count for Twyneo was -24.2 versus -17.4 for the vehicle group (P&lt;0.001).
<strong>Safety and Tolerability</strong>
In both trials, Twyneo was found to be well-tolerated and the majority of local skin reactions, when reported, were mild and improved over time. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events and 4 unrelated serious adverse events (1 Twyneo, 3 vehicle) were reported across both trials.

<strong>About Twyneo</strong>
Twyneo is an investigational, antibiotic-free, fixed-dose combination of microencapsulated tretinoin 0.1% and microencapsulated benzoyl peroxide 3% cream. Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin are widely prescribed and considered to be highly effective in the treatment for acne vulgaris; however, benzoyl peroxide causes degradation of the tretinoin, thereby reducing its effectiveness. Twyneo overcomes this degradation through the use of Sol-Gel’s microencapsulation technology platform, thereby allowing for a stable drug combination, extending drug delivery time of the active ingredients, and reducing potential irritation caused by direct application of the drug to the skin.
<strong>About Acne Vulgaris</strong>
Acne vulgaris is a common multifactorial skin disease that according to the American Academy of Dermatology affects approximately 40 to 50 million people in the United States. The disease occurs most frequently during childhood and adolescence (affecting approximately 80% of all adolescents) but it may also appear in adults. Acne patients suffer from the appearance of lesions on areas of the body with a large concentration of oil glands, such as the face, chest, neck and back. These lesions can be inflamed (papules, pustules, nodules) or non-inflamed (comedones). Acne can have a profound effect on the quality of life of those suffering from the disease. In addition to carrying a substantial risk of permanent facial scarring, the appearance of lesions may cause psychological strain, social withdrawal and lowered self-esteem.
<strong>About Sol-Gel Technologies</strong>
Sol-Gel is a clinical-stage dermatology company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing branded and generic topical drug products for the treatment of skin diseases. In addition to Twyneo, Sol-Gel’s current branded product candidate pipeline consists of Epsolay®, a late-stage branded product candidate for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea that also leverages - the proprietary microencapsulation technology platform, and SGT-210, a topical epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor for the treatment of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I.

<b>Forward-Looking Statements
</b>This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of the BeiGene strategic collaboration, including the impact on non-GAAP EPS, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies or in support of products we have acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","LEXINGTON, Mass., Jan. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Pulmatrix, Inc. (NASDAQ: PULM), a clinical-stagebiopharmaceutical company developing innovative inhaled therapies to address serious pulmonary diseases, today announced that it has entered into a licensing and development agreement with the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson*.  Through the agreement, the Lung Cancer Initiative gains an option to access a portfolio of narrow spectrum kinase inhibitors intended for development in lung cancer interception.
“Pulmatrix’s iSPERSE™ platform has the ability to enhance the safety and efficacy profile of promising drug candidates,” said Ted Raad, Chief Executive Officer of Pulmatrix. “We applied the iSPERSE™ technology to RV1162/PUR1800, the lead in-licensed inhibitor and helped unlock its clinical potential by improving the product’s profile from the original formulation.  In 2020, we anticipate clinical data from the first of these inhibitors in a disease area with significant unmet medical need. We look forward to collaborating with the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson as we advance this important program.  Additionally, in 2020, we anticipate data from our phase 2 Pulmazole program and we plan to introduce new proprietary, wholly owned iSPERSE enabled 505(b)(2) assets to our pipeline.”
Under the terms of the agreement, the Lung Cancer Initiative will pay a $7.2 million upfront payment and an additional $2 million milestone payment upon completion of the ongoing Phase 1b study of RV1162/PUR1800 in stable COPD patients, on-track for year-end 2020.  If the Lung Cancer Initiative exercises the option on RV1162/PUR1800 and the portfolio of these kinase inhibitors, Pulmatrix is eligible for up to $91M in additional development and commercial milestones, as well as royalty payments.

<p class=""bwalignc""><i>GRAVITAS-301 results show that treatment with itacitinib in combination with corticosteroids did not statistically improve overall response rate or non-relapse mortality compared to placebo plus corticosteroids</i></p>
<p class=""bwalignc"">- <i>Conference call scheduled today at 5:00 p.m. ET</i></p>
<div class=""bw-release-story"">
WILMINGTON, Del.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Incyte Corporation (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced that the pivotal Phase 3 GRAVITAS-301 study evaluating itacitinib in combination with corticosteroids in patients with treatment-naïve acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) did not meet the primary endpoint of improving overall response rate (ORR) at Day 28 compared to placebo plus corticosteroids (74.0 percent vs. 66.4 percent, p=0.08, respectively). Itacitinib added to corticosteroids improved the overall response rate in patients with treatment-naïve acute GVHD; however, the difference versus placebo plus corticosteroids was not statistically significant. In addition, there was no difference observed in non-relapse mortality (NRM) at Month 6, the study’s key secondary endpoint, between the treatment and placebo arms.
The safety profile observed in GRAVITAS-301 was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies of itacitinib in combination with corticosteroids. The most common adverse events were thrombocytopenia (34.9 percent for itacitinib and 34.7 percent for placebo) and anemia (29.8 percent for itacitinib and 25.0 percent for placebo).
“The result of this study is disappointing. However, we remain committed to building on the success of the REACH program for ruxolitinib, which showed positive results in steroid refractory acute GVHD. Additionally we will continue to study the role of JAK inhibition in chronic GVHD and in the prophylactic setting, as we seek to develop treatments for patients with this debilitating and often fatal disease,” said Steven Stein, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Incyte.
Incyte will inform investigators of the results and work with them to appropriately conclude the study in a manner consistent with the best interest of each patient. Data from this study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting.
<b>About GRAVITAS-301</b>
GRAVITAS-301 (NCT03139604) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 study evaluating itacitinib or placebo, in combination with corticosteroids, as a first-line treatment for patients with acute GVHD. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) at Day 28, defined as the proportion of subjects demonstrating a complete response, very good partial response, or partial response. The key secondary endpoint is non-relapse mortality at Month 6, defined as the proportion of subjects who died due to causes other than malignancy relapse. Other secondary endpoints include duration of response.

MARSEILLE, France, Jan. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <strong><a href=""https://www.biospace.com/employer/534521/innate-pharma/"">Innate Pharma SA</a></strong> (Euronext Paris: IPH – ISIN: FR0010331421; Nasdaq: IPHA) (“<strong>Innate</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”) today announced that the <strong><a href=""https://www.biospace.com/employer/545052/european-medicines-agency-ema-/"">European Medicines Agency</a></strong> (EMA) has accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Lumoxiti<sup>®</sup> (moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk), a first-in-class medicine indicated for adult patients with relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia (HCL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including treatment with a purine nucleoside analog.
<em>“If approved by the EMA, Lumoxiti will be the first treatment available in Europe for relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia patients in more than twenty years, </em><em>potentially changing the standard of care for these patients</em><em>,”</em> <strong>commented Pierre Dodion, MD, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma. </strong><em>“We are dedicated in addressing the unmet need in this rare form of cancer that can result in serious and life-threatening conditions, and as such, are hopeful we can bring this important medicine to patients in Europe as soon as possible.” </em>
The EMA filing is based on the final analysis of the pivotal Phase III trial of Lumoxiti, presented at ASH 2019<sup>*</sup>. These data showed that 36 percent (29/80) of the relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia patients achieved durable complete response, defined as a CR with a hematological remission maintained for at least 180 days. The objective response rate (ORR) was at 75 percent. Eighty-one percent of patients with CR experienced eradication of minimal residual disease as reflected by MRD-negative status. In addition, there was a 61 percent probability that patients who achieved a CR would maintain it after five years.
The EMA filling acceptance follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Lumoxiti in September 2018.
<strong>About Lumoxiti (moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk):</strong>
Lumoxiti is a CD22-directed immunotoxin and a first-in-class treatment in the US for adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) hairy cell leukemia (HCL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including treatment with a purine nucleoside analog. Lumoxiti is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl = 29 mL/min). It comprises the CD22 binding portion of an antibody fused to a truncated pseudomonas exotoxin. The toxin inhibits protein synthesis and ultimately triggers apoptotic cell death. Lumoxiti received U.S. FDA approval in September 2018 and has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of r/r HCL. AstraZeneca is the current Biologics License Application (BLA) holder for Lumoxiti in the US, and is also the marketing authorization applicant for the EU filing.
<strong>About the ‘1053’ Phase III trial:</strong>
The approval of Lumoxiti was based on data from the AstraZeneca-sponsored, open-label ‘1053’ trial, which was a single-arm, multi-center Phase III clinical trial assessing the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of Lumoxiti monotherapy in patients with r/r HCL who have received at least two prior therapies, including one purine nucleoside analog. The trial enrolled 80 patients and was conducted across 34 sites in 14 countries. The primary endpoint was durable complete response (CR), defined as CR with hematologic remission (blood count normalization) for more than 180 days. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, relapse-free survival, progression-free survival, time to response, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenic potential.
<strong>About Innate Pharma:</strong>
Innate Pharma S.A. is a commercial stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.
Innate Pharma’s commercial-stage product, Lumoxiti, in-licensed from AstraZeneca in the US, EU and Switzerland, was approved by the FDA in September 2018.

<strong>TEL-AVIV, Israel and RALEIGH, N.C., January 2, 2020</strong> <a href=""https://www.redhillbio.com/RedHill/"">RedHill Biopharma Ltd.</a> (Nasdaq: <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RDHL?p=RDHL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"">RDHL</a>) (Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange: <a href=""https://info.tase.co.il/Eng/General/Company/Pages/companyMainData.aspx?subDataType=0&amp;companyID=001573&amp;shareID=01122381"">RDHL</a>) (“RedHill” or the “Company”), a specialty biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on commercialization and development of proprietary drugs for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, today announced that it has provided Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Salix) with a notice of termination of their 2014 license agreement and has regained the worldwide exclusive rights to RHB-106, a proprietary encapsulated formulation for bowel preparation, currently under development.
“We are pleased to regain the rights to RHB-106, which aligns well with our expanded gastrointestinal-focused commercial activities in the U.S., and to pursue its development toward potential U.S. FDA approval,” <strong>said Dror Ben-Asher, RedHill’s CEO. </strong>“The quality of a bowel preparation, defined by its safety, palatability and efficacy, directly impacts the success of a colonoscopy. We believe RHB-106’s novel flavorless solid oral pill formulation holds significant potential advantages over current bowel preparations and could ease patient burden and improve the likelihood of a successful outcome.”
It is estimated that approximately 19 million colonoscopies are performed annually in the U.S.<sup>1</sup> The annual number of procedures in the U.S. is increasing, presumably due to the rising awareness of colorectal cancer. The 2019 sales of bowel preparations in the U.S. are estimated at approximately $580 million<sup>2</sup>.
<strong>About RHB-106
</strong>RHB-106 is a proprietary, flavorless, odorless, solid oral encapsulated formulation intended for the preparation and cleansing of the gastrointestinal tract prior to the performance of abdominal procedures and diagnostic tests, such as colonoscopies, barium enemas or virtual colonoscopies, as well as surgical interventions, such as laparotomies. RHB-106 can be taken with water and avoids patient exposure to the often unpalatable taste of current products. A Phase 2a study with a previous formulation of the RHB-106 actives was concluded in Australia with 62 patients demonstrating significantly improved patient response and comparable bowel cleansing, potentially allowing for an unobstructed procedure with reduced side-effects and improved compliance.

During the option period, Leap has agreed to study the combination of DKN-01 and tislelizumab. Leap plans to evaluate DKN-01 with tislelizumab in approximately 40 patients with second-line gastric cancer (GC) / gastroesophageal junction cancer (GEJ) whose tumors express high levels of <span class=""xn-money"">DKK1</span> to build upon the the positive clinical experience of DKN-01 in combination with PD-1 inhibitors in these patients. In addition, Leap plans to evaluate the combination of DKN-01 with tislelizumab and chemotherapy in approximately 20 patients with first-line GC/GEJ. Leap expects to initiate these clinical trials in the first half of 2020.

Upon stockholder approval and conversion of the preferred stock, the investors will also receive warrants to purchase up to an equal number of shares of common stock at an exercise price of <span class=""xn-money"">$2.11</span> per share. The aggregate gross proceeds to Leap from this offering are approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$27 million</span>, before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by Leap, and not including proceeds from the exercise of any warrants. Subject to customary closing conditions, the equity financing is scheduled to close on or before <span class=""xn-chron"">January 8, 2020</span>.
Leap plans to hold a special meeting of stockholders to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of <span id=""spanHghlt82ea"">common</span> stock, the conversion of the convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock, the issuance of the warrants, and related matters. In connection with such stockholder meeting, Leap entered into a voting agreement with entities affiliated with HealthCare Ventures holding an aggregate of 29.3% of the company's outstanding common stock to vote all of their beneficially owned shares in favor of the matters to be proposed at the special meeting of stockholders.

<b>About DKN-01</b>
DKN-01 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks the activity of the Dickkopf-1 <span class=""xn-money"">(DKK1)</span> protein, a modulator of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling, a signaling pathway frequently implicated in tumorigenesis and suppressing the immune system. <span class=""xn-money"">DKK1</span> has an important role in tumor cell signaling and in mediating an immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment through enhancing the activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and downregulating NK ligands on tumor cells.
<b>About gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) /gastric adenocarcinoma</b>
The gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is the area where the esophagus and stomach join together. Given its anatomic location, GEJ adenocarcinomas have often been grouped together with either esophageal or gastric cancers in large. Gastric adenocarcinoma (gastric cancer) remains one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide, especially among older males<sup>i</sup>. Based on GLOBOCAN 2018 data, stomach cancer is the 5<sup>th </sup>most common neoplasm and the 3<sup>rd </sup>most deadly cancer, with an estimated 783,000 deaths in 2018<sup>i</sup>. Gastric cancer incidence and mortality are highly variable by region and highly dependent on diet and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection<sup>i</sup>.

AstraZeneca today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) and granted Priority Review for <i>Farxiga</i> (dapagliflozin) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death or the worsening of heart failure (HF) in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with and without type-2 diabetes (T2D).<i> Farxiga</i> is a first-in-class, oral once-daily selective inhibitor of human sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2).<i></i>
The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for this supplemental application, is scheduled for the second quarter of 2020.
The sNDA was based on results from the landmark Phase III DAPA-HF trial published in September 2019 in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1911303?query=main_nav_lg"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>, which showed <i>Farxiga</i> on top of standard of care reduced the incidence of the composite outcome of CV death or the worsening of HF versus placebo.
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “<i>Farxiga</i> is well established in the treatment of type-2 diabetes and this Priority Review shows its potential to also impact millions of patients with heart failure. If approved, <i>Farxiga</i> will be the first and only medicine of its kind indicated to treat patients with heart failure.”
<a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-for-farxiga-in-heart-failure.html"">In September 2019</a>, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the development of <i>Farxiga</i> in HF. <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-for-farxiga-in-chronic-kidney-disease-27082019.html"">In August 2019</a>, the FDA also granted Fast Track designation for the development of <i>Farxiga</i> to delay the progression of renal failure and prevent CV and renal death in patients with chronic kidney disease, with and without T2D.
<i>Farxiga</i> is indicated as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapies to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D. <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2019/farxiga-approved-in-the-us-to-reduce-the-risk-of-hospitalisation-for-heart-failure-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes-21102019.html"">In October 2019</a>, the FDA also approved <i>Farxiga</i> to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure in patients with T2D and established cardiovascular disease or multiple CV risk factors.
<b>Heart failure</b>
Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening disease in which the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body.<sup>1</sup> It affects approximately 64 million people worldwide (at least half of which have a reduced ejection fraction) and is a chronic and degenerative disease where half of patients will die within five years of diagnosis.<sup>2,3,4</sup> HF remains as fatal as some of the most common cancers in both men (prostate and bladder cancers) and women (breast cancers).<sup>5</sup> It is the leading cause of hospitalisation for those over the age of 65 and represents a significant clinical and economic burden.<sup>6</sup>
<b>DAPA-HF</b>
DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure) is an international, multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised, double-blinded trial in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (LVEF = 40%), with and without T2D, designed to evaluate the effect of <i>Farxiga</i> 10mg, compared with placebo, given once daily in addition to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint was time to the first occurrence of a worsening heart failure event (hospitalisation or equivalent event; i.e. an urgent heart failure visit), or cardiovascular death.
<b><i>Farxiga</i></b>
<i>Farxiga</i> (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor indicated as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapies to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction, as an adjunct to diet and exercise in adults with T2D. <i>Farxiga</i> has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

About istradefylline
Istradefylline is an orally administered, selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist. Istradefylline
was approved in Japan (product name: NOURIAST®) in March 2013 for improving the “wearing-off”
phenomenon in patients with Parkinson’s disease on levodopa-containing preparations. Istradefylline
was also approved in the US (product name: NOURIANZTM) in August 2019 for use as adjunctive
treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease experiencing “off”
episodes.
About Parkinson's disease
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms
such as tremors, rigidity, slow movement and postural instability. It is thought to be caused by
progressive degeneration associated with decreased levels of dopamine in certain parts of the brain,
i.e., the substantia nigra and striatum.

<h3><b><i>Patients in China will benefit from Lokelma’s rapid reduction
of potassium in the blood and the sustained treatment effect
</i></b></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca’s <i>Lokelma</i> (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) has been approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with hyperkalaemia (elevated levels of potassium in the blood).
The approval by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) was based on positive results from the extensive <i>Lokelma</i> clinical trial programme and a pharmacodynamic study in China which showed that patients receiving Lokelma experienced a significant, rapid and sustained reduction of potassium in the blood.
In 2019, the NMPA included <i>Lokelma</i> on the Accelerated Approval list of “Overseas New Drugs in Clinical Urgent Needs for China”, recognising the significant unmet need for effective medicines treating hyperkalaemia.
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “This approval marks an important milestone for more than two million patients in China who suffer from hyperkalaemia. <i>Lokelma</i> will offer the opportunity for patients and physicians to achieve long-term disease control and potentially reduce the risk of acute episodes, which can have serious, even life-threatening consequences.”
The <i>Lokelma</i> clinical trials programme includes three double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials and one open-label trial, where patients with hyperkalaemia were treated for up to 12 months. These trials showed that for patients receiving <i>Lokelma,</i> the median time to achieving normal potassium levels in the blood was 2.2 hours, with 98% achieving normal levels within 48 hours from baseline.<sup>1-3</sup> <i>Lokelma</i> also demonstrated a rapid reduction of potassium in the blood as early as one hour with one dose and a sustained treatment effect for up to one year.<sup>1,2,4</sup> <i>Lokelma</i> was well tolerated, with few serious adverse events.<sup>2</sup>
<i>Lokelma</i> is approved in the US, the EU and Canada for the treatment of hyperkalaemia. It is undergoing separate regulatory review in Japan, with a decision expected in the first half of 2020.
<b>Hyperkalaemia</b>
Hyperkalaemia is characterised by high levels of potassium in the blood (generally classified as &gt;5mmol/l).<sup>1</sup> The risk of hyperkalaemia increases significantly for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and for those who take common medications for heart failure (HF), such as RAAS inhibitors, which can increase potassium in the blood. Hyperkalaemia occurs in 23% to 47% of patients with CKD and/or HF, with an estimated 200 million and 64 million people, respectively, living with each condition worldwide.<sup>5-7</sup> Hyperkalaemia may lead to cardiac arrest and death, with mortality being up to 30% in patients with severe hyperkalaemia, if not treated rapidly.<sup>8</sup>
<b><i>Lokelma</i></b>
<i>Lokelma</i> is an insoluble, non-absorbed sodium zirconium silicate, formulated as a powder for oral suspension, that acts as a highly selective potassium-removing medicine. It is administered orally, is odourless, tasteless and stable at room temperature. It has been evaluated in three double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials and in one 12-month open-label trial in patients with hyperkalaemia.

<span class=""xn-location"">SHANGHAI</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Jan. 3, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- I-Mab Biopharma (""I-Mab""), a global biopharmaceutical company based in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> and focused on the discovery and development of novel or highly differentiated biologics in immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases today announced the dosing of the first patient in mainland <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> in its registrational study evaluating its human CD38 antibody (TJ202/MOR202) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM).
I-Mab initiated two registrational trials with TJ202/MOR202 in relapsed or refractory MM in <span class=""xn-location"">Taiwan</span> in early 2019 and expanded these trials into mainland <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> in late 2019, after receiving IND clearance from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). The first trial (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03860038?term=tj202&amp;rank=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">NCT03860038</a>), a Phase 2 trial, is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TJ202/MOR202 as a third-line treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory MM, while the second trial (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03860038?term=tj202&amp;rank=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">NCT03952091</a>) is assessing the efficacy and safety of the combination of TJ202/MOR202 plus lenalidomide (LEN) and dexamethasone (DEX) versus the combination of LEN and DEX in patients with relapsed or refractory MM who received at least one prior line of treatment. Site preparations in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> have proceeded well with the first patient being dosed on schedule in the Phase 2 study. Under I-Mab's fast-to-market development strategy, both studies have been designed as pivotal trials, which, if successful, could pave the way for new drug applications (NDA) for TJ202/MOR202 in <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span>.
""We are pleased that the first patient has been successfully dosed in mainland <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jingwu Zang</span>, MD., PhD., Founder and Honorary Chairman of I-Mab Biopharma. ""The initiation of enrollment in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> of TJ202/MOR202 is an important milestone. We look forward to accelerating TJ202/MOR202 clinical program significantly towards registration, which will benefit the patients with multiple myeloma in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span><span id=""spanHghltd8f5"">,"" added</span> Dr. Zang.
TJ202/MOR202 is a differentiated antibody originally developed by MorphoSys AG that has shown promise in preclinical animal studies and early human clinical trials. I-Mab licensed the product from MorphoSys and owns the exclusive rights for its development and commercialization in mainland <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Hong Kong</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Macao</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Taiwan</span>. I-Mab is developing this product in multiple myeloma and in certain autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus.
<b>About TJ202/MOR202</b>
TJ202/MOR202 is an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody derived from the MorphoSys HuCAL antibody technology. The antibody is directed against CD38 on the surface of multiple myeloma cells, which has been characterized as one of the most strongly and uniformly expressed antigens on the surface of malignant plasma cells. According to its suggested mechanism of action, the antibody recruits cells of the body's immune system to kill the tumor through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). The antibody does not involve complement dependent cytotoxicity, or CDC, an additional immune mechanism involved in tumor cell killing. Scientific research suggests that anti-CD38 antibodies may have therapeutic potential in other cancers and autoimmune diseases. Based on a license agreement between MorphoSys and I-Mab signed in <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2017</span>, I-Mab owns the exclusive rights for the development and commercialization of TJ202/MOR202 in mainland <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Taiwan</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Hong Kong</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Macao</span>.

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced an exclusive worldwide research collaboration and license agreement with Taiho Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd., (“Taiho”) and Astex Pharmaceuticals (UK), a wholly owned subsidiary of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Astex”), focused on the development of small molecule inhibitors against several drug targets, including the KRAS oncogene, which are currently being investigated for the treatment of cancer.
“At Merck we continue to pursue new regimens designed to extend the benefits of highly selective therapies to more patients with cancer,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “This agreement with Taiho and Astex combines our respective small molecule assets and industry-leading expertise in cancer cell signaling to enable development of the most promising drug candidates.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Merck, Taiho and Astex will combine preclinical candidates and their data with knowledge and expertise from their respective research programs. In exchange for providing Merck an exclusive global license to their small molecule inhibitor candidates, Taiho and Astex will receive an aggregate upfront payment of $50 million and will be eligible to receive approximately $2.5 billion contingent upon the achievement of preclinical, clinical, regulatory and sales milestones for multiple products arising from the agreement, as well as tiered royalties on sales. Merck will fund research and development and will be responsible for commercialization of products globally. Taiho has retained co-commercialization rights in Japan and an option to promote in specific areas of South East Asia.
“Taiho has used its unique and proprietary drug discovery platform to generate a number of small molecule inhibitors,” said Teruhiro Utsugi, Ph.D., managing director at Taiho. “This alliance builds on our KRAS research up to now and together with Merck, allows us to combine our expertise to significantly accelerate the global research, development, and commercialization of a number of our mutant KRAS programs by accessing external talent and resources.”
“Together with our Taiho colleagues we are delighted to be working with Merck, one of the global leaders in oncology drug development, on this strategic alliance. This collaboration is another testament to Astex’s position as the leader in fragment-based drug discovery,” said Harren Jhoti, Ph.D., president and CEO of Astex.
KRAS is among the most frequently mutated oncogenes in cancer. It is estimated to occur in more than 90% of pancreatic cancers and approximately 20% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and is associated with poorer outcomes.

<span class=""xn-location"">SHANGHAI</span>, <span id=""spanHghlt864b""><span class=""xn-chron"">Jan. 6</span></span>, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- InxMed (<span class=""xn-location"">Shanghai</span>) Co., Ltd., a clinical stage biotech company dedicated to developing innovative, individualized medicines with international impact, today announced that the company has entered into a clinical collaboration with a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co, Inc. <span class=""xn-location"">Kenilworth, NJ</span> U.S.A., known as MSD outside <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, to evaluate  IN10018, an investigational proprietary focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor in combination with  pembrolizumab, MSD's  anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with pancreatic cancer. InxMed will be the study sponsor and MSD will provide pembrolizumab to InxMed to use in the clinical study. This is the first global clinical collaboration between the two companies.
Dr. Zaiqi Wang, InxMed's Chairman and CEO, commented: ""IN10018 is an innovative best-in-class FAK inhibitor with significant effect on tumor micro-environment, a<span id=""spanHghltce33""> critical</span> component to conquer tumor. We are very excited that MSD has collaborated with InxMed with the goal of developing additional treatment options for patients with pancreatic cancer through the evaluation of IN10018 in combination with <span id=""spanHghlt3c49"">pembrolizumab</span>. This collaboration marks an important step forward for InxMed to <span id=""spanHghlta150"">steadily</span> implement its best in disease combination strategy.

Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Manuel Hidalgo Medina</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and Senior Member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and a world leading expert in pancreatic cancer, said: ""There is a huge <span id=""spanHghlt2468"">unmet</span> medical need for pancreatic cancer patients and we need to tackle both cancer cells and tumor stroma to make future therapeutics work. FAK inhibitors could <span id=""spanHghlt8358"">enhance</span> pancreatic cancer treatment in combination with other therapeutic <span id=""spanHghlt34e4"">modalities</span>.""
""Stroma is a significant issue for pancreatic cancer patients. Our recent research has indicated that, mechanistically, FAK inhibitors could significantly reduce the level of stroma and fibrosis and therefore enable the penetration of therapeutic agents to render/sensitize pancreatic cancers to either chemotherapy or immunotherapy,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Paul Timpson</span>, Professor at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in <span id=""spanHghltf88e""><span class=""xn-location"">Sydney</span></span>, a leading expert in the studies of tumor stroma and therapeutic resistance, and author in Science and Translational Research and Nature Communication.

<p align=""left"">SAN DIEGO, Jan. 06, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sorrento Therapeutics (Nasdaq: SRNE) announced today that its partner Mabpharm (HK:2181) filed recently a New Drug Application for the Infliximab biosimilar antibody in China. Sorrento plans to file a Biologics License Application (BLA) for the Infliximab biobetter antibody in the United States in 2020.</p>
Infliximab (currently commercialized under the trade name Remicade<sup>®</sup> - trademark of Janssen) is an injectable monoclonal antibody prescription drug that's used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis (a type of spinal arthritis), psoriatic arthritis, and the red, scaly skin patches of plaque psoriasis. Usually prescribed when other medicines or treatments have failed, infliximab belongs to a class of drugs called tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFs), which work by suppressing the action of a protein called TNF, which has been tied to inflammation.
Sorrento, through a global licensing agreement with Mabpharm, owns the global rights to the Mabpharm Infliximab biobetter antibody outside of China. Mabpharm recently submitted a new drug application with the National Medical Products Administration (the NMPA) for a recombinant anti-TNF-alpha chimeric monoclonal antibody based on infliximab. This variant uses CHO expression system, resulting in a potentially better safety profile and lower immunogenicity when compared to the currently marketed competitive drugs.
Sorrento is planning to file all the required document for a Biologics License Application (BLA) by the end of 2020.

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(<a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-604 trial investigating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with chemotherapy met one of its dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) in the first-line treatment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). In the study, treatment with KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (etoposide plus cisplatin or carboplatin) resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to chemotherapy alone (HR=0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.91]), which was observed at a prior interim analysis. At the final analysis of the study, there was also an improvement in overall survival (OS) for patients treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone; however, these OS results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical plan (HR=0.80 [95% CI, 0.64-0.98]). The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and discussed with regulatory authorities.
“Results of KEYNOTE-604 demonstrated the potential of KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy, to improve outcomes for patients newly diagnosed with extensive stage small cell lung cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We sincerely thank the patients and investigators for their participation in this study and are committed to helping patients who face difficult-to-treat types of lung cancer.”
In addition to KEYTRUDA’s five current indications in lung cancer, Merck is continuing to study KEYTRUDA across multiple settings and stages of lung cancer through a broad clinical program, which is comprised of more than 10,000 patients enrolled or expected to be enrolled across 20 Merck-sponsored clinical studies.
<b>About KEYNOTE-604</b>
KEYNOTE-604 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03066778) investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed ES-SCLC. The dual primary endpoints were OS and PFS. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), safety and quality of life (QoL). The study enrolled 453 patients who were randomized to receive either:
<ul>
 	<li class=""bwlistitemmargb"">KEYTRUDA (200 mg fixed dose on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle) in combination with etoposide (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Days 1, 2 and 3) and investigator's choice of platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin titrated to AUC 5 on Day 1 or cisplatin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Day 1); or</li>
 	<li class=""bwlistitemmargb"">Placebo in combination with etoposide (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Days 1, 2 and 3) and investigator's choice of platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin titrated to AUC 5 mg/mL/min on Day 1 or cisplatin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Day 1).</li>
</ul>
<b>About Lung Cancer</b>
Lung cancer, which forms in the tissues of the lungs, usually within cells lining the air passages, is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than die of colon and breast cancers combined. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of all cases. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 10 to 15% of all lung cancers. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed in the U.S. with any stage of SCLC is estimated to be 6%.
<b>About KEYTRUDA</b> <sup><b>®</b> </sup><b>(pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg</b>
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>
<b>Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)</b>
<i>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</i>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib</i>
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
<b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b>
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.
<b>Adverse Reactions</b>

Rockland, MA and New York, US, January 6, 2020 – EMD Serono, the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany in the US and Canada, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced the Phase III JAVELIN Bladder 100 study met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) at the planned interim analysis. In this study, patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) whose disease did not progress on induction chemotherapy and who were randomized to receive first-line maintenance therapy with BAVENCIO® (avelumab)* and best supportive care (BSC) lived significantly longer than those who received BSC only. A statistically significant improvement in OS was demonstrated in the BAVENCIO arm in each of the co-primary populations: all randomized patients and patients with PD-L1–positive tumors. The safety profile for BAVENCIO in the trial was consistent with that in the JAVELIN monotherapy clinical development program. The results of the study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical congress and shared with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health authorities.
“BAVENCIO is the first immunotherapy to demonstrate in a clinical trial a statistically significant improvement in overall survival as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma,” said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “These latest positive data from the JAVELIN clinical development program add to the body of evidence for BAVENCIO in the treatment of genitourinary cancers, and we look forward to discussing these results with health authorities.”
UC accounts for about 90% of all bladder cancer.<sup>1</sup> When bladder cancer is metastatic, the five-year survival rate is 5%.<sup>2</sup> Combination chemotherapy is currently the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced disease, but despite high initial response rates, durable and complete responses following first-line chemotherapy are uncommon, and most patients will ultimately experience disease progression within nine months after initiation of treatment.<sup>3,4</sup>
“Our unique maintenance approach with BAVENCIO has significantly prolonged survival for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in this trial,” said Luciano Rossetti, Head of Global R&amp;D for EMD Serono. “We believe this approach could become part of routine clinical practice, as these results are a major advance on the existing standard of care.”
In 2017, the FDA approved BAVENCIO for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response and duration of response. JAVELIN Bladder 100 is the confirmatory study for the conversion to full approval.
*BAVENCIO is under clinical investigation for the first-line maintenance treatment of advanced UC. There is no guarantee that BAVENCIO will be approved for first-line maintenance treatment of UC by any health authority worldwide.
<strong>About JAVELIN Bladder 100</strong>
JAVELIN Bladder 100 (NCT02603432) is a Phase III, multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study investigating first-line maintenance treatment with BAVENCIO plus BSC versus BSC alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC whose disease did not progress after completion of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy. A total of 700 patients whose disease had not progressed after induction chemotherapy as per RECIST v1.1 were randomly assigned to receive either BAVENCIO plus BSC or BSC alone. The primary endpoint is OS in co-primary populations of all patients and patients with PD-L1-positive tumors. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, anti-tumor activity, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, predictive biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes in the co-primary populations.
<strong>About Urothelial Carcinoma</strong>
Bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer worldwide.<sup>5</sup> In 2018, there were over half a million new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed, with around 200,000 deaths from the disease globally.<sup>5</sup> UC accounts for about 90% of all bladder cancers.<sup>6</sup> This subtype becomes harder to treat as it advances, spreading through the layers of the bladder wall.<sup>7</sup> For patients with metastatic bladder cancer, the five-year survival rate is 5%.<sup>2</sup> Given the poor prognosis for patients with advanced bladder cancer whose disease progresses after first-line chemotherapy, there is an urgent need for additional treatment options that improve overall survival.<sup>8</sup>
<strong>About the JAVELIN Clinical Development Program</strong>
The clinical development program for BAVENCIO, known as JAVELIN, involves more than 10,000 patients evaluated across more than 15 different tumor types. In addition to urothelial carcinoma, these tumor types include head and neck cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma.
<strong>About BAVENCIO® (avelumab)</strong>
BAVENCIO is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. BAVENCIO has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, BAVENCIO has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.<sup>9-11</sup> In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize BAVENCIO.
<strong>BAVENCIO Approved Indications</strong>
BAVENCIO® (avelumab) in combination with axitinib is indicated in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
In the US, the FDA granted accelerated approval for BAVENCIO for the treatment of (i) adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Avelumab is currently approved for patients with MCC in 50 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.
<strong>BAVENCIO Important Safety Information from the US FDA-Approved Label</strong>
BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis, and evaluate suspected cases with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis. Pneumonitis occurred in 1.2% of patients, including one (0.1%) patient with Grade 5, one (0.1%) with Grade 4, and five (0.3%) with Grade 3.
BAVENCIO can cause <strong>hepatotoxicity and immune-mediated hepatitis</strong>, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) immune-mediated hepatitis until resolution and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred with BAVENCIO as a single agent in 0.9% of patients, including two (0.1%) patients with Grade 5, and 11 (0.6%) with Grade 3.
<p class=""rteindent1"">BAVENCIO<em> in combination with axitinib</em> can cause <strong>hepatotoxicity</strong> with higher than expected frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are used as monotherapy. Withhold BAVENCIO and axitinib for moderate (Grade 2) hepatotoxicity and permanently discontinue the combination for severe or life-threatening (Grade 3 or 4) hepatotoxicity. Administer corticosteroids as needed. In patients treated with BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and AST occurred in 9% and 7% of patients, respectively, and immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% of patients, including 4.9% with Grade 3 or 4.</p>
BAVENCIO can cause <strong>immune-mediated colitis</strong>. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold BAVENCIO until resolution for moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) colitis until resolution. Permanently discontinue for life-threatening (Grade 4) or recurrent (Grade 3) colitis upon reinitiation of BAVENCIO. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.5% of patients, including seven (0.4%) with Grade 3.
BAVENCIO can cause<strong> immune-mediated endocrinopathies</strong>, including adrenal insufficiency, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.
<p class=""rteindent1"">Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of <strong>adrenal insufficiency</strong> during and after treatment, and administer corticosteroids as appropriate. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency was reported in 0.5% of patients, including one (0.1%) with Grade 3.</p>
<p class=""rteindent1""><strong>Thyroid disorders</strong> can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Manage hypothyroidism with hormone replacement therapy and hyperthyroidism with medical management. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) thyroid disorders. Thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis, were reported in 6% of patients, including three (0.2%) with Grade 3.</p>
<p class=""rteindent1""><strong>Type 1 diabetes mellitus</strong> including diabetic ketoacidosis: Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Withhold BAVENCIO and administer antihyperglycemics or insulin in patients with severe or life-threatening (Grade =3) hyperglycemia, and resume treatment when metabolic control is achieved. Type 1 diabetes mellitus without an alternative etiology occurred in 0.1% of patients, including two cases of Grade 3 hyperglycemia.</p>
BAVENCIO can cause <strong>immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction</strong>. Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) nephritis until resolution to Grade 1 or lower. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.1% of patients.
BAVENCIO can result in <strong>other severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions </strong>involving any organ system during treatment or after treatment discontinuation. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, evaluate to confirm or rule out an immune-mediated adverse reaction and to exclude other causes. Depending on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue BAVENCIO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and initiate hormone replacement therapy, if appropriate. Resume BAVENCIO when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or lower following a corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for any severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of 1738 patients treated with BAVENCIO as a single agent or in 489 patients who received <em>BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib</em>: myocarditis including fatal cases, pancreatitis including fatal cases, myositis, psoriasis, arthritis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, pemphigoid, hypopituitarism, uveitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and systemic inflammatory response.
BAVENCIO can cause severe or life-threatening <strong>infusion-related reactions</strong>. Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to the first 4 infusions and for subsequent infusions based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 25% of patients, including three (0.2%) patients with Grade 4 and nine (0.5%) with Grade 3.
<em>BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib </em>can cause <strong>major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)</strong> including severe and fatal events. Consider baseline and periodic evaluations of left ventricular ejection fraction. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular events. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue BAVENCIO and axitinib for Grade 3-4 cardiovascular events. MACE occurred in 7% of patients with advanced RCC treated with BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib compared to 3.4% treated with sunitinib. These events included death due to cardiac events (1.4%), Grade 3-4 myocardial infarction (2.8%), and Grade 3-4 congestive heart failure (1.8%).
BAVENCIO can cause <strong>fetal harm</strong> when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus including the risk of fetal death. Advise females of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BAVENCIO and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO. It is not known whether BAVENCIO is excreted in human milk. Advise a lactating woman <strong>not to breastfeed</strong> during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.

 	<li><strong>ADDING CELL TYPES SUPPORTS DISCOVERY OF DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPIES FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES AND TRIGGERS US$ 6 M PAYMENT TO EVOTEC</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<strong>Hamburg, Germany, 07 January 2020:</strong>
Evotec SE (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: EVT, MDAX/TecDAX, ISIN: DE0005664809) announced today that the Company received a US$ 6 m payment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) following the decision to expand the collaboration to include additional cell lines.
Evotec and Celgene, which is now a Bristol-Myers Squibb company, initiated the collaboration in December 2016 to identify disease-modifying treatments for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently approved drugs only offer short-term management of patients’ symptoms and there is a huge unmet medical need for therapies that slow down or reverse disease progression in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. This collaboration pursues an innovative approach to the discovery and development of novel medicines by leveraging several of Evotec’s unique technology platforms in conjunction with the human iPSC based platform, which is one of the largest and most sophisticated platforms in the industry. The iPSC partnership between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Evotec has already been expanded with additional cell lines several times.
<strong>Dr Cord Dohrmann, Chief Scientific Officer of Evotec, commented:</strong> “We are very pleased about this latest expansion of our iPSC-alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Patient-derived disease models will be instrumental to improving the translatability of pre-clinical discovery efforts into clinical benefits and we are proud to leverage our proprietary iPSC platform together with Bristol-Myers Squibb for the benefit of the patients.”

<h5><em>About Evotec and iPSC</em></h5>
<em>Induced pluripotent stem cells (also known as iPS cells or iPSCs) are a type of pluripotent stem cell that can be generated directly from adult cells. The iPSC technology was pioneered by Shinya Yamanaka’s lab in Kyoto, Japan, who showed in 2006 that the introduction of four specific genes encoding transcription factors could convert adult cells into pluripotent stem cells. He was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize along with Sir John Gurdon “for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent”. Pluripotent stem cells hold great promise in the field of regenerative medicine. Because they can propagate indefinitely, as well as give rise to every other cell type in the body (such as neurons, heart, pancreatic and liver cells), they represent a single source of cells that could be used to replace those lost to damage or disease. Evotec has built an industrialised iPSC infrastructure that represents one of the largest and most sophisticated iPSC platforms in the industry. Evotec’s iPSC platform has been developed over the last years with the goal to industrialise iPSC-based drug screening in terms of throughput, reproducibility and robustness to reach the highest industrial standards.</em>

LONDON &amp; CAMBRIDGE, England &amp; BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 2020-- <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bicycletherapeutics.com%2F&amp;esheet=52154161&amp;newsitemid=20200107005285&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Bicycle+Therapeutics+plc&amp;index=1&amp;md5=7e2ed3732803d862e8b6e5b14f76e76c"" rel=""nofollow"">Bicycle Therapeutics plc</a> (NASDAQ: BCYC), a biotechnology company pioneering a new and differentiated class of therapeutics based on its proprietary bicyclic peptide (<i>Bicycle®</i>) technology, today announced a second collaboration with Cancer Research UK, the world’s largest independent funder of cancer research, in which Cancer Research UK will fund and sponsor development of BT7401, a multivalent <i>Bicycle</i> CD137 agonist, through a Phase IIa clinical study.
“The modular nature of the Bicycle platform enables a number of opportunities to generate new therapeutics that could address unmet need in oncology and other serious diseases,” said Kevin Lee, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Bicycle. “This new collaboration marks yet another initiative designed to help us bring a potentially important <i>Bicycle</i>-based therapy to patients more efficiently. We are excited to extend our relationship with Cancer Research UK by collaborating with them on BT7401. Cancer Research UK is a partner of choice, with a broad network of collaborators and extensive expertise in cancer treatment. Through our collaboration, we believe we will be able to characterize the biologic and therapeutic profile of BT7401, which we’re pleased to add to our growing portfolio of novel immuno-oncology assets.”
Dr. Nigel Blackburn, Cancer Research UK's director of drug development, said: ""We’re delighted to be partnering again with Bicycle, building on our continuing relationship. Based on the preclinical data, we believe that BT7401 could offer improved anti-tumor activity with fewer side effects compared with antibody-based approaches, which so far have been limited by toxicity.”
Dr. Blackburn continued: “Looking to the future, we believe BT7401 has the potential to open up new treatment options for the large numbers of patients who stop responding to checkpoint inhibitors, and we look forward to working with Bicycle in this new endeavor.”
BT7401 is a chemically synthesized, multivalent small molecule agonist of CD137, comprised of <i>Bicycles </i>connected by stable linkers through a central hinge. Though prior programs using antibodies to agonize CD137 have demonstrated robust and durable anti-tumor effects, they have been limited by severe hepatotoxicity observed in clinical trials. Preliminary toxicology studies suggest BT7401 may circumvent this limitation. In addition, BT7401 has shown significant pharmacologic activity in preclinical models. These findings indicate that BT7401 may offer an improved therapeutic index compared to that of antibody-based approaches.
Under the terms of the Clinical Development Partnerships agreement, Cancer Research UK’s Centre for Drug Development will fund and sponsor development of BT7401 from current preclinical studies through the completion of a Phase IIa trial. Bicycle retains the right to advance the BT7401 program further, at which point an undisclosed payment split between cash and equity, success-based milestones and royalty payments would be made to Cancer Research UK.

NEW YORK &amp; WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--<b>Tyme Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: TYME) (""TYME""), </b>an emerging biotechnology company developing cancer metabolism-based therapies (CMBTs™), and <b>Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: EGRX) (“Eagle”), </b>today announced the formation of a U.S. strategic collaboration focused on the co-promotion of TYME’s lead CMBT candidate oral SM-88 in advanced cancers. CMBTs are proprietary investigational compounds that are believed to disrupt cancer cells’ protein synthesis, leading to a breakdown of the cancer’s key defenses and cell death. In clinical trials, oral SM-88 has demonstrated complete or partial responses across 15 different cancers, including pancreatic, prostate, sarcoma, breast, lung, and blood cancers with minimal serious grade 3 or higher adverse events.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">
“TYME’s approach is unique and transformational. Targeting cancer’s metabolism by disrupting protein synthesis has advantages over existing treatment approaches in terms of both efficacy and safety,” said Scott Tarriff, Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Pharmaceuticals. “This collaboration provides an excellent opportunity to continue expanding our presence in the oncology space, as well as to evaluate potential combination opportunities with SM-88 in our existing pipeline. We look forward to leveraging our oncology sales infrastructure to maximize the commercialization of SM-88 in the U.S., if approved. As always, our goal remains to deliver innovative, next-generation therapeutics to address patient needs and to create value for our shareholders,” concluded Tarriff.

In addition, TYME will receive a $20 million milestone payment upon the successful completion of the first to occur of the following three events: (1) achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in its TYME-88-Panc pivotal trial; or (2) achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the PanCAN Precision Promise? SM-88 registration arm; or (3) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of SM-88 in any cancer. This payment would be split into a $10 million milestone cash payment and a $10 million investment in TYME at a 15% premium to the then prevailing market price. Eagle’s shares will be restricted from sale until the earlier of three months following the milestone event or the three-year anniversary of the agreement.
Under the terms of the co-promotion agreement, Eagle Pharmaceuticals will undertake 25% of the promotional sales effort for SM-88 in the U.S. oncology market and receive 15% of the net U.S. revenues of SM-88, and TYME will be responsible for the remaining promotional effort. TYME will also be responsible for clinical development, regulatory approval, commercial strategy, marketing, reimbursement and manufacturing of SM-88. TYME retains the remaining 85% of net U.S. revenues and reserves the right to repurchase Eagle’s co-promotion right for $200 million.
As part of this partnership between TYME and Eagle, there is also the potential to evaluate oral SM-88 in combination therapy or as monotherapy through leveraging Eagle’s oncology pipeline and expertise in oncology settings, which may include trials in breast or lung cancers and other tumor types.
“We are extremely pleased to establish this collaboration with Eagle Pharmaceuticals who shares our passion and commitment to improving the lives of patients with advanced cancers. After a thorough due diligence process by both parties, each came away with great respect for each organization’s capabilities and potential,” said Steve Hoffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TYME. “This alliance provides TYME with the commercial and capital resources to advance our leadership position in the field of cancer metabolism and the potential to expand our capabilities and accelerate clinical programs that will create value for all of our stakeholders, most importantly for the patients we serve.”
<b>About SM-88</b>
SM-88 is an oral investigational modified proprietary tyrosine derivative that is believed to interrupt the metabolic processes of cancer cells by breaking down the cells’ key defenses and leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. Clinical trial data have shown that SM-88 has demonstrated encouraging tumor responses across 15 different cancers, including pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate and sarcoma cancers with minimal serious grade 3 or higher adverse events.
Clinical results of SM-88, based on data as of April 25, 2019, from the Phase II portion of the TYME-88-Panc study, were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology <strong>21st World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer in </strong>Barcelona, Spain on Wednesday, July 4, 2019 (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fs22.q4cdn.com%2F265040820%2Ffiles%2Fdoc_downloads%2Fscientific-presentations%2F2019%2F06%2FESMO_poster2019_90x120cm_vFinal_Jun22%255b1%255d%255b2%255d.pdf&amp;esheet=52154202&amp;newsitemid=20200107005551&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=TYME-88-Panc+poster&amp;index=1&amp;md5=71120c03e3f5c29c80e62364f4e161b8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">TYME-88-Panc poster</a>). The study demonstrated a median overall survival in evaluable patients (38 of 49) of 6.4 months. These survival results compare very favorably to the analysis of 19 prospective pancreatic cancer trials where the median reported survival after progressing on second-line therapy was 2.0 – 2.5 months<sup>1</sup> based on reported historical trials. In the Phase II portion of the TYME-88-Panc study, a RECIST CBR of stable disease or better was achieved by 44% of patients (11 of 25) with available imaging. Patients achieving stable disease or better demonstrated a statistically significant (p=0.02) improvement in survival with a 92% reduction in risk of death (hazard ratio=0.08). The CBR was durable with a majority of patients remaining in stable disease or better for more than 7 months after receiving treatment with SM-88. The study showed a median reduction of 63% in CTC burden in evaluable patients. Patients (10 of 24) with available results reaching an 80% reduction or greater in CTCs demonstrated a 60% decrease in risk of death (hazard ratio=0.40).
The Phase II portion of the TYME-88 Panc study reported that SM-88 was well tolerated with only 4.0% of patients (2 of 49) who experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) deemed at least possibly related to SM-88 (abdominal pain, arthralgia, and hypotension). One patient with reported SAEs continued on treatment.
<b>About Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</b>
Advanced pancreatic cancer is a difficult-to-treat cancer with the lowest survival rates among all cancer types. Across all patients with pancreatic cancer, relative 5-year survival is 8% and is less than 3% for those with advanced disease.<sup>2</sup> The median survival for patients in end-stage of the disease is approximately 3 months. There are two main types of pancreatic cancer - adenocarcinomas, which accounts for approximately 90% of all pancreatic cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors. Pancreatic cancer is relatively uncommon with new cases accounting for only 2.1% of all newly diagnosed cancers. However, pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death for men and women in the United States.
<b>About Precision Promise?</b>
Precision Promise? is an adaptive randomized Phase III registration-ready clinical trial. The objective of Precision Promise? is to expedite the study and approval of promising therapies for pancreatic cancer by bringing multiple stakeholders together, including academic, industry and regulatory entities. The primary goal of SM-88’s inclusion is to study SM-88 as a monotherapy treatment arm for patients who have failed one prior line of chemotherapy. Additionally, it is planned that SM-88 will be evaluated in combination with gemcitabine (Gemzar ®) and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane ®) for first-line patients. The primary end point of these randomized trials is overall survival.
<b>About Tyme Technologies</b>
Tyme Technologies, Inc., is an emerging biotechnology company developing cancer therapeutics that are intended to be broadly effective across tumor types and have low toxicity profiles. Unlike targeted therapies that attempt to regulate specific mutations within cancer, the Company’s therapeutic approach is designed to take advantage of a cancer cell’s innate metabolic weaknesses to compromise its defenses, leading to cancer cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system.

SUZHOU, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, Jan. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (""Innovent"") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, autoimmune, metabolic and other major diseases, and Sirnaomics Inc. (""Sirnaomics""), a leading biopharmaceutical company in discovery and development of RNAi therapeutics against cancer and fibrotic diseases, jointly announced today that the two companies have entered a strategic collaboration to conduct clinical studies, using Innovent's antibody drug Tyvyt<sup>®</sup> (sintilimab injection) and Sirnaomics' RNAi drug candidate STP705 (cotsiranib), for combination treatment in advanced cancers, such as Hepatocellular Carcinomas (HCC), with high unmet need in the US.
Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Hui Zhou</span>, Vice President and Head of Oncology Strategy and Medical Sciences of Innovent, stated, ""Sintilimab was granted marketing approval by the NMPA in 2018 and has been the only PD-1 inhibitor included in the NRDL since 2019. Sintilimab has gained broad recognition by the market, due to its profiles in safety and efficacy. Through partnership with other companies, we are exploring more sintilimab-based combination therapies and have seen some promising results. Developing a combination therapy, comprised of an antibody drug and a RNAi drug, may provide more comprehensive and effective treatments for patients. The potential clinical value of the combination therapy of sintilimab and cotsiranib will be evaluated and we hope more patients will benefit from this potential therapy globally.""
<span class=""xn-person"">Patrick Lu</span>, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sirnaomics, stated, ""This collaborative effort between Sirnaomics and Innovent will be the first example of a combination strategy using an RNAi drug candidate together with an approved immune checkpoint antibody drug for the treatment of liver cancers. This represents an important clinical approach for combating these deadly diseases where the silencing of gene targets that reduce T-cell access and activity may augment the activity of checkpoint inhibitors in liver cancer.""
<span class=""xn-person"">Michael Molyneaux</span>, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Sirnaomics, stated, ""Sirnaomics is very excited to enter into this collaboration agreement with Innovent to potentially bring lifesaving therapies to patients with Hepatocellular Cancers. It is well known that, despite recent advances in cancer therapies, HCC is still a deadly form of liver cancer with high unmet need. Our pre-clinical Proof of Concept oncology data has consistently demonstrated single agent efficacy with STP705 in HCC and our most recent work on mechanism of action strongly suggest that the use of our lead asset (STP705) in combination with antibody therapies could greatly benefit patients with HCC. Innovent has a very strong track record for innovation and execution in the clinical space and a shared vision of bringing lifesaving therapies to their patients. We believe that combining Sirnaomics novel siRNA technology with Innovent's cutting edge antibody therapies has the potential to significantly improve the current treatment landscape for patients with Hepatocellular Cancer.""
<b>About Tyvyt<sup>®</sup> (Sintilimab Injection)</b>
Tyvyt<sup>®</sup> (sintilimab injection), an innovative drug jointly developed in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> by Innovent and Lilly, was granted marketing approval by the NMPA for r/r cHL in 2018, and included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (""CSCO"") for Lymphoid Malignancies. Tyvyt<sup>®</sup> (sintilimab injection) has been the only anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody included in the NRDL since 2019.
Tyvyt<sup>®</sup> (sintilimab injection) is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1/ PD-1 Ligand-1 (PD-L1) pathway and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies for sintilimab injection to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including eight registration or pivotal clinical trials. Innovent is also conducting clinical studies of sintilimab injection in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>.
<b>About STP705 (Cotsiranib)</b>
Sirnaomics' leading product candidate, STP705, is an siRNA (small interfering RNA) therapeutic which takes advantage of a dual-targeted inhibitory property and polypeptide nanoparticle (PNP)-enhanced delivery to directly knock down both TGF-ß1 and COX-2 gene expression. The product candidate has received multiple IND approvals from both the US FDA and Chinese NMPA, including treatments of Cholangiocarcinoma, Non-Melanoma skin cancer and Hypertrophic Scar. STP705 has also received Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of Cholangiocarcinoma and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis. STP705 has demonstrated a dramatic improvement in T-cell penetration into tumors in the liver with single agent action as well as improvement in the efficacy of an anti-PD-L1 antibody checkpoint inhibitor in an HCC model. This effect may improve other immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacies in addition to those targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis.

<p class=""subtitle"">For people battling advanced heart failure, Abbott's HeartMate 3 heart pump can now be implanted through an incision in the chest wall versus open heart surgery</p>
<p class=""subtitle"">- New, less invasive technique provides cardiac surgeons with the ability to choose the optimal surgical method for their patients</p>
ABBOTT PARK, Ill., <span class=""xn-chron"">Jan. 7, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-less-invasive-surgical-approach-for-abbotts-heart-pump-to-help-patients-avoid-open-heart-surgery-300982723.html#financial-modal"">ABT</a>) today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a new alternative surgical technique for Abbott's HeartMate 3 heart pump that will allow more advanced heart failure patients to avoid open heart surgery. The new, less invasive approach is designed to provide surgeons a choice in surgical method for patients receiving the HeartMate 3™ Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD), the industry's leading heart pump.
Approximately 615,000 people in the U.S. are living with heart failure and nearly 40% are considered to have reached an advanced stage where traditional therapies no longer work. Heart pumps are small, implantable mechanical devices that pump blood through the body in people whose heart is too weak to do so on its own. People living with a heart pump may be waiting for a heart transplant or may not be candidates for a transplant and will live with the device for the rest of their life.
Historically, heart pumps have been implanted via open heart surgery. With approval for an alternative surgical technique, Abbott's HeartMate 3 heart pump can now be implanted via lateral thoracotomy – a surgical approach where an incision is made between a patient's ribs to access the heart. Physicians believe that for many patients this technique has advantages over open heart surgery because it can result in less bleeding and a shorter recovery time for patients.
""This is a significant advancement for patients who can now receive a life-saving LVAD through an alternative procedure that can yield shorter hospital stays and a faster recovery,"" said heart transplant surgeon <span class=""xn-person"">Igor Gosev</span>, M.D., University of Rochester Medical Center in <span class=""xn-location"">Rochester, New York</span>. ""Heart failure is a crippling and costly disease so being able to offer patients the HeartMate 3 heart pump with this less-invasive approach gives them the opportunity to return to a better quality of life more quickly.""
The approval is based on two studies – the ELEVATE study: a multi-center, voluntary, observational registry collecting post-marketing data, and the LAT Feasibility study: a single arm, prospective, multicenter study. Results of the two trials found that bleeding (requiring surgery), infection and arrhythmias were lower in the group implanted via the less-invasive surgical approach than those who underwent open heart surgery.
""We continue to focus on advancing our heart failure devices and techniques to make life better for the patients we serve,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Robert L. Kormos</span>, M.D., medical director for mechanical circulatory support at Abbott. ""The first approved LVAD—HeartMate I—was approved more than 25 years ago. Since that time, the technology has evolved immensely. Today's HeartMate 3 device, including its design and size, allows physicians to successfully implant it without having to perform open heart surgery and offers survival rates, as demonstrated in the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2683616-1&amp;h=2436435293&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fabbott.mediaroom.com%2F2018-03-11-New-Long-Term-Data-Show-Improved-Survival-and-Lower-Rates-of-Stroke-and-Pump-Thrombosis-for-Abbotts-HeartMate-3-Heart-Pump&amp;a=MOMENTUM+3+clinical+trial"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">MOMENTUM 3 clinical trial</a>, at two-years that are comparable to heart transplants.""
The HeartMate 3 received approval from the FDA in 2017 for patients with advanced heart failure whose hearts are unable to circulate blood through the body, and are waiting for a transplant, known as bridge to transplant. In 2018, HeartMate 3 was approved as a destination therapy for those individuals who are in need of a new heart but are not eligible for a transplant.
<b>ABOUT ABBOTT'S HEARTMATE 3 LVAD</b><br class=""dnr"" />Abbott's HeartMate 3 LVAD is a small, implantable mechanical circulatory support device for advanced heart failure patients who are awaiting transplantation or are not candidates for heart transplantation. It is the first commercially approved (CE Mark and FDA approved) LVAD with Full MagLev<sup>™</sup> technology, which allows the device's rotor to be ""suspended"" by magnetic forces. This design aims to reduce trauma to blood passing through the pump and improve outcomes for patients. In the largest LVAD trial in the world, HeartMate 3 LVAD showed a survival rate of <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2683616-1&amp;h=355019671&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fabbott.mediaroom.com%2F2018-03-11-New-Long-Term-Data-Show-Improved-Survival-and-Lower-Rates-of-Stroke-and-Pump-Thrombosis-for-Abbotts-HeartMate-3-Heart-Pump&amp;a=82.8+percent"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">82.8 percent</a> at two years.

CAMBRIDGE, England--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--PhoreMost Limited, the UK-based biopharmaceutical company dedicated to drugging ‘undruggable’ disease targets, today announced it has entered into a multi-project drug discovery collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, one of the world-leading pharmaceutical companies developing innovative therapies for diseases with unsatisfactory treatments. Under the terms of the agreement, PhoreMost will receive an upfront payment and research funding together with downstream success-based milestones. Further financial terms are not disclosed.
PhoreMost will deploy its in-house expertise and next-generation phenotypic screening platform, SITESEEKER<sup>®</sup>, towards disease relevant pathways nominated by Boehringer Ingelheim. Novel targets identified will be further validated and characterised by Boehringer Ingelheim as part of its internal Discovery Research pipeline. Boehringer Ingelheim’s Research programme is active in the fields of immunology and respiratory diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, oncology research and immuno-oncology, as well as diseases of the central nervous system.
The SITESEEKER platform is based on PhoreMost’s core proprietary protein interference, or ‘PROTEINi’, technology. Using SITESEEKER, PhoreMost probes the entire proteome in a live cell environment for novel druggable targets linked to any chosen disease, using the vast 3-D shape diversity of natural protein fragment (sub-domain) libraries. This enables the systematic unmasking of cryptic druggable sites, directly linking them to useful therapeutic functions.
<b>Dr Chris Torrance, CEO of PhoreMost, said: </b><i>“We are delighted that Boehringer Ingelheim has chosen to work with PhoreMost to enhance its drug discovery pipeline with attractive biological starting points. The collaboration is further recognition of the ability of PROTEINi and SITESEEKER to identify novel targets, and we look forward to working with the Boehringer Ingelheim team on these projects.”</i>

MONROVIA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 8, 2020-- Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ:XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune disease, asthma and allergic diseases, today announced it has entered into a technology license agreement in which Gilead Sciences, Inc., will access Xencor’s Xtend™ extended half-life and Cytotoxic XmAb<sup>®</sup> Fc technologies for developing and commercializing GS-9722, Gilead’s first-in-class effector-enhanced broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibody, which is currently in Phase 1 clinical development.
“Xencor’s plug-and-play antibody engineering platform enables selective licensing of our Fc domain technologies to partners to improve drug candidate properties in their own antibody development programs,” said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer at Xencor. “This agreement with Gilead expands the potential of XmAb technologies to create new therapies for people living with HIV.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Xencor has granted Gilead an exclusive license for GS-9722 and up to three additional anti-HIV antibodies. Xencor retains the right to grant licenses for other antibodies directed to the target. Gilead will be solely responsible for the activities and costs related to research, development, regulatory and commercial activities. Xencor will receive an upfront payment and is eligible to receive milestones and royalties for the successful development and commercialization of these products.
<b>About Xtend™ XmAb<sup>®</sup> Fc Technology</b>
Xencor’s Xtend™ XmAb<sup>®</sup> Fc domains increase circulating half-life by increasing binding affinity to the receptor FcRn. FcRn is present inside lysosomes in endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and functions to rescue antibodies from the degradation that makes most proteins short-lived in circulation. Half-life extension can be exploited to potentially improve therapeutic antibody performance in several ways, such as increasing dosing interval or decreasing drug quantities at the same dosing interval compared to a parent antibody. Xtend technology is currently in multiple clinical-stage programs and one approved therapy, Alexion’s Ultomiris<sup>®</sup> (ravulizumab-cwvz).
<b>About Cytotoxic XmAb<sup>®</sup> Fc Technology</b>
Xencor’s Cytotoxic XmAb<sup>®</sup> Fc domain is designed to improve the immune system’s elimination of tumor and other pathologic cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The Cytotoxic Fc domain is engineered to increase binding affinity to activating Fc? receptors to enhance activation of natural killer (NK) cells and other immune cells such as macrophages, which play a role in immunity by engulfing and digesting foreign material.
<b>About Xencor, Inc.</b>
Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases. Currently, 15 candidates engineered with Xencor's XmAb<sup>®</sup> technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor's XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>KEYTRUDA Is the First Anti-PD-1 Therapy Approved for Certain Patients With High-Risk, Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</b></p>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy.
“Today’s approval of KEYTRUDA reinforces our company’s commitment to expanding existing treatment options for certain patients with high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “As the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in this setting, KEYTRUDA will be a new clinical option for a patient population that previously had limited FDA-approved therapies available.”
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.
“High-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is a serious disease, characterized by frequent recurrences and progression,” said Arjun V. Balar, M.D., associate professor of Medicine and director of Genitourinary Medical Oncology at NYU Langone Health’s Perlmutter Cancer Center. “Historically, patients with high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer with CIS whose cancer is unresponsive to BCG treatment had limited non-surgical treatment options. As a physician who specializes in the management of bladder cancer, it is encouraging to now have a new treatment option for these patients.”
<b>Data Supporting the Approval</b>
The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-057 (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT02625961&amp;esheet=52155574&amp;newsitemid=20200108005864&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT02625961&amp;index=1&amp;md5=9f7c8fcee22bd5fa1701fadb69fbf581"" rel=""nofollow"">NCT02625961</a>), a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial in 96 patients with BCG-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy. In this study, BCG-unresponsive high-risk NMIBC was defined as persistent disease despite adequate BCG therapy, disease recurrence after an initial tumor-free state following adequate BCG therapy, or T1 disease following a single induction course of BCG. Adequate BCG therapy was defined as administration of at least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus either of: at least two of three doses of maintenance therapy or at least two of six doses of a second induction course. Prior to treatment, all patients had undergone transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove all resectable disease (Ta and T1 components). Residual CIS (Tis components) not amenable to complete resection was allowed. The trial excluded patients with muscle invasive (i.e., T2, T3, T4) locally advanced non-resectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, concurrent extra-vesical (i.e., urethra, ureter or renal pelvis) non-muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium, or autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression.
Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every three weeks until unacceptable toxicity, persistent or recurrent high-risk NMIBC, or progressive disease. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 12 weeks for two years and then every 24 weeks for three years, and patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. The major efficacy outcome measures were complete response (as defined by negative results for cystoscopy [with TURBT/biopsies as applicable], urine cytology, and computed tomography urography [CTU] imaging) and duration of response.
The study population characteristics were: median age 73 years (range: 44 to 92); 44% age =75; 84% male; 67% White; and 73% and 27% with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, respectively. Tumor pattern at study entry was CIS with T1 (13%), CIS with high grade TA (25%), and CIS (63%). Baseline high-risk NMIBC disease status was 27% persistent and 73% recurrent. The median number of prior instillations of BCG was 12.
The median follow-up time was 28.0 months (range: 4.6 to 40.5 months). KEYTRUDA demonstrated a complete response rate of 41% (range: 31 to 51). Among the 39 patients who achieved a complete response, the median duration of response was 16.2 months (range: 0.0+ to 30.4+), and 46% (n=18) had a response of 12 months or longer.
The safety of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-057, which enrolled 148 patients with high-risk NMIBC, 96 of whom had BCG-unresponsive CIS with or without papillary tumors. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 4.3 months (range: 1 day to 25.6 months).
KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 11% of patients. The most common adverse reaction (&gt;1%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 22% of patients; the most common (=2%) were diarrhea (4%) and urinary tract infection (2%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of KEYTRUDA-treated patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (=2%) in KEYTRUDA-treated patients were pneumonia (3%), cardiac ischemia (2%), colitis (2%), pulmonary embolism (2%), sepsis (2%), and urinary tract infection (2%). The most common adverse reactions (=20%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (29%), diarrhea (24%) and rash (24%).
<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong>
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>
<b>Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)</b>
<i>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</i>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib</i>
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
<b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b>
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

New five-year, multi-target alliance aims to translate first-in-class science and drug discovery into new drugs for polycystic ovary syndrome / Partners will have access to big data-driven target identification as highly promising approach via Evotec’s alliance with Celmatix Inc. / Milestone payments potentially more than EUR 330 million and EUR 16.5 million upfront and research payments.
<b>Hamburg and Berlin, Germany, January 9, 2020</b> – Evotec SE (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: EVT, MDAX/TecDAX, ISIN: DE0005664809) and Bayer AG today announced the expansion of their partnership in women’s health indications with a new five-year, multi-target collaboration to develop multiple clinical candidates for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Under the terms of the agreement, both companies will contribute drug targets and a comprehensive set of high-quality technology platforms to jointly develop innovative treatment options. The strategic alliance will also have access to targets from the recently formed partnership between Celmatix Inc. and Evotec. Celmatix is the world leader in big data-driven target discovery focused on fertility and women’s health.
“Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common, underdiagnosed and undertreated disease among women, with several serious co-morbidities. The currently available treatment options are also limited and insufficient,” said Dr. Cord Dohrmann, Chief Scientific Officer of Evotec. “Our long-term partnership with Bayer and the progression of multiple clinical candidates has been very successful and we look forward to continuing the relationship to deliver novel therapies for the benefit of patients with PCOS.”
“There is a high unmet medical need for women worldwide suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome. This new research alliance will perfectly complement Bayer's research activities in the area of women’s health,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “We look forward to joining our forces with Evotec in PCOS to develop new treatment options for women living with this often devastating condition.”
Bayer and Evotec will share responsibilities during the pre-clinical development of potential clinical candidates. Bayer will be responsible for any subsequent clinical development and commercialization. Evotec will receive EUR 6.5 million upfront payment and EUR 10 million research payments over five years. In addition, Evotec might be eligible to receive pre-clinical, clinical and sales milestones of potentially over EUR 330 million as well as royalties up to low double-digit percentage of net sales.
In 2012, Bayer and Evotec entered their first strategic five-year, multi-target alliance. The collaboration was successfully completed resulting in three clinical and one pre-clinical drug candidate currently advancing through development for the treatment of endometriosis. A second research alliance was initiated in 2016 to develop multiple clinical candidates for the treatment of kidney diseases.
<b>About polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</b>
PCOS is the most frequent endocrine disorder in women linked to metabolic dysfunction and the most frequent cause of female infertility. 83 percent of infertility or pregnancy complications may be caused by PCOS. It is estimated that PCOS occurs in 5-10 percent of women. PCOS has a high unmet medical need due to limited treatment options. PCOS is characterised by high levels of androgens (male hormones such as testosterone) produced in the ovaries, adrenals and fat tissue leading to the typical skin signs of androgen access such as hair loss and acne. Ovarian cysts give the syndrome its name and are associated with irregular menstrual cycle and the above described infertility. 80 percent of PCOS patients suffer from obesity and more than half are afflicted with insulin resistance, both driven by this endocrinological disorder. While the underlying cause of PCOS is largely unknown, genomic studies underpin a strong genetic background.
<b>About the Evotec-Celmatix partnership in women’s health</b>
In October 2019, Evotec and Celmatix, a precision medicine company with a proprietary multi-omics platform, announced a partnership to develop pre-clinical programmes in prevalent but underserved conditions affecting women’s reproductive health, including PCOS, endometriosis, and infertility. In this research collaboration, Evotec is responsible for medicinal chemistry, in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, in addition to its broad development capabilities and expertise, while Celmatix contributes novel drug target discovery, powered by its proprietary multi-omics Reproductive Atlas™ platform. The partnership was expanded in December 2019 with Evotec participating in a funding round.

<em>Heidelberg, Germany, January 9<sup>th</sup>, 2020</em> – BioMed X announced today the start of a new joint research group in collaboration with Merck. With this new group, BioMed X and Merck extend their ongoing collaboration to a total of six joint research projects at the BioMed X Innovation Center in Heidelberg, Germany. The new project will focus on the role of the intestinal epithelial barrier in the development and exacerbation of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS).
Loss of intestinal barrier function is correlated with several autoimmune diseases. The main objective of the new group supported by Merck is to understand the molecular mechanisms of the interactions between intestinal epithelial barrier and immune cells in autoimmune diseases, in particular the interactions between dendritic cells and intestinal enterocytes. Studies will involve the use of conventional and high-throughput metagenomics, generation of intestinal organoids from murine and human subjects, isolation of immune cells and establishing a three dimensional in-vitro co-culture model to observe interactions of the intestinal epithelial barrier with immune cells. The goal of the project is to identify novel biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for the treatment of intestinal barrier loss to prevent the development and progression of autoimmune diseases.
“We are excited to further extend our collaboration with Merck”, said Christian Tidona, founder and Managing Director of BioMed X. “This is our first joint research group with Merck beyond the field of oncology and we are looking forward to working with Merck’s Translational Innovation Platform Immunology in Billerica near Boston.”

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 9, 2020-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) announced today that the company has licensed The Rockefeller University’s portfolio of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV, including the two clinical-stage agents 3BNC117 and 10-1074. These investigational agents have potential for use in HIV long-acting therapies for treatment and prevention, as well as cure strategies.
HIV bNAbs are a class of immunotherapy agents that were originally derived from HIV-infected individuals with a strong anti-HIV immunologic response and were designed to target HIV, particularly originating from the latent viral reservoir. Initial pre-clinical and clinical research has shown that HIV bNAbs can produce an enhanced, prolonged immune response to HIV, representing a promising new approach for HIV treatment or prevention in combination with other long-acting agents, or prolonged virologic remission in the absence of antiretroviral use. This licensing agreement provides an additional pathway for innovations in Gilead’s HIV pipeline in areas of evolving and unmet medical need.
“The Rockefeller University’s broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies are well studied and have shown exceptional promise in early clinical trials,” said Diana Brainard, MD, Senior Vice President, HIV and Emerging Viruses, Gilead Sciences. “By harnessing the body’s own immune system against HIV, we seek to continue driving scientific innovation that will transform care and improve overall outcomes for all people living with HIV.”
“Our scientists have amassed an extensive body of research showing that neutralizing antibodies have the potential to transform HIV therapy for many people living with the disease,” said Jeanne Farrell, PhD, Associate Vice President for Technology Advancement at The Rockefeller University. “We are committed to ensuring that this and other promising discoveries realize their promise to impact healthcare, by partnering with commercial stewards capable of advancing academic programs into potential future products that may benefit patients.”
Under the agreement, Gilead acquires exclusive global licenses to develop and commercialize Rockefeller’s full portfolio of HIV bNAbs. Rockefeller will receive an upfront payment and is eligible to receive cumulative milestone payments, as well as royalties on net sales. Additionally, Rockefeller will retain rights to perform non-clinical and early-stage clinical research on the portfolio of HIV antibodies.
Antibodies 3BNC117 and 10-1074 are investigational therapies and are not approved by any regulatory body globally; their safety and efficacy have not been established. There is no cure for HIV or AIDS.

LEXINGTON, Mass., Jan. 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: KLDO), a clinical-stage healthcare company with a chemistry-driven approach to leveraging the microbiome organ to treat disease and improve human health, today announced the initiation of a research collaboration with Janssen’s World Without Disease Accelerator*, part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson. The collaboration will explore the potential for Kaleido’s Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (MMT™) to prevent the onset of childhood allergy and other atopic, immune and metabolic conditions by driving specific microbiome features which support an appropriate maturation of the infant immune system. The agreement was facilitated by Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation.
A primary focus of the research will be to utilize Kaleido’s proprietary ex vivo screening platform to identify MMTs candidates that support the growth of specific beneficial microbes. These MMTs will then be further evaluated for their ability to prevent atopic conditions such as infant allergy.
“Research has shown the microbiome has the potential to impact a broad range of diseases, so the ability of our MMTs to drive the composition and function of the gut resident microbes could hold significant promise for improving health,” said Johan van Hylckama Vlieg, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Kaleido. “We are excited to apply our platform and extend our research in microbiome-driven immune modulation into infant health together with Janssen. This program will build on and deepen our understanding of how MMTs promote the growth of beneficial microbes driving the gut ecosystem to support immune homeostasis and reduce the risk of onset for allergies and other health conditions.”
About Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (MMT™)
Kaleido’s Microbiome Metabolic Therapies, or MMTs, are designed to drive the function and distribution of the microbiome organ’s existing microbes in order to decrease or increase the production of metabolites, or to advantage or disadvantage certain bacteria in the microbiome community. The Company’s initial MMT candidates are targeted glycans that are orally administered, have limited systemic exposure, and are selectively metabolized by enzymes in the microbiome. Kaleido utilizes its human-centric discovery and development platform to study MMTs in microbiome samples in an ex vivo setting, followed by advancing MMT candidates rapidly into clinical studies in healthy subjects and patients. These human clinical studies are conducted under regulations supporting research with food, evaluating safety, tolerability and potential markers of effect. For MMT candidates that are further developed as therapeutics, the Company conducts clinical trials under an Investigational New Drug (IND) or regulatory equivalent outside the U.S., and in Phase 2 or later development.
About Kaleido Biosciences
Kaleido Biosciences is a clinical-stage healthcare company with a differentiated, chemistry-driven approach to leveraging the microbiome organ to treat disease and improve human health. The Company has built a human-centric proprietary product platform to enable the rapid and cost-efficient discovery and development of novel Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (MMT™). MMTs are designed to modulate the metabolic output and profile of the microbiome by driving the function and distribution of the organ’s existing microbes. Kaleido is advancing a broad pipeline of MMT candidates with the potential to address a variety of diseases and conditions with significant unmet patient needs.

<strong>SAN DIEGO, Jan. 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —</strong> eFFECTOR Therapeutics, Inc., a leader in the development of selective translation regulators (STRs) for the treatment of cancer, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement to develop small-molecule inhibitors of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a key oncogenic driver located downstream from both the RAS and PI3K signaling pathways. eIF4E is an effector protein that is activated in a variety of human cancers and is linked to poor prognosis and resistance to certain therapies.
Under terms of the agreement, eFFECTOR will receive a $15 million payment upfront, and will be eligible for additional potential $492M in R&amp;D funding, development and sales milestone payments. eFFECTOR will receive royalties on sales of any products that may result from this collaboration if the program reaches commercialization and has an option to enter into a co-promotion and profit and loss share arrangement in the United States.
“This collaboration underscores the importance of the emerging field of translation regulation as an exciting new therapeutic approach,” said Steve Worland, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of eFFECTOR. “It will leverage our collective development capabilities and Pfizer’s global commercial resources to build momentum around eIF4E inhibitor development and maximize the potential impact for cancer patients. Importantly, we believe that this agreement validates eFFECTOR’s pursuit of eIF4E, which has been a protein of interest for drug development for many years but has been very challenging to develop small molecules to target due to the nature of its binding site.”
“We look forward to working with eFFECTOR with the goal of bringing a promising new therapy to patients with various treatment-refractory cancers,” said Jeff Settleman, Ph.D., senior vice president and chief scientific officer, oncology, worldwide research, development &amp; medical, Pfizer.
<strong>The Role of eIF4E in Cancer</strong>
eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E) is a highly oncogenic and historically intractable target that is activated in a variety of human cancers and is linked to poor prognosis and resistance to certain therapies. eIF4E is an effector protein integrating signals from multiple important oncogenes and tumor suppressor proteins in the PI3K and RAS oncogenic pathways (including PI3K, AKT, mTOR, PTEN and BRAF), and selectively regulates the translation of a set of target mRNA distinct from those regulated by MNK1/2 and eIF4A. This may expand the potential patient population that may benefit from translation regulation therapy.
<strong>About eFFECTOR Therapeutics</strong>
eFFECTOR Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company at the forefront of an emerging class of therapeutics known as selective translation regulators or STRs. By acting on key biological mechanisms responsible for tumor growth and immune suppression, STRs represent a promising small molecule approach for treating cancer. eFFECTOR’s most advanced program, tomivosertib (eFT508), is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of several types of cancer. eFFECTOR has entered into clinical collaboration agreements with a strategic alliance between Pfizer and Merck KGaA to study tomivosertib in combination with avelumab and separately with Merck &amp; Co to evaluate tomivosertib in combination with KEYTRUDA.

<strong>NEW YORK, January 8, 2020 – Immunic, Inc. (Nasdaq: IMUX), </strong>a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing best-in-class, oral therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, today announced that its subsidiary, Immunic AG, under the terms of its existing option and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. (hereinafter, Daiichi Sankyo), has exercised its exclusive global option to license a group of compounds, designated by Immunic as IMU-856. The company intends to begin phase 1 clinical studies for this program in the first half of 2020. IMU-856 is an orally available, small molecule modulator that targets a yet undisclosed protein which serves as a transcriptional regulator of the intestinal barrier function. As such, IMU-856 represents a new and potentially disruptive approach for the treatment of intestinal diseases with the potential to restore the intestinal barrier function while maintaining immunocompetency.
IMU-856 was discovered and developed by Daiichi Sankyo. The option and license agreement gives Immunic the exclusive rights to commercialization of IMU-856 in all countries, including the United States, Europe and Japan. The option also includes exclusivity on a patent application filed by Daiichi Sankyo, covering IMU-856’s composition of matter. Concurrent with the option exercise, Immunic will pay to Daiichi Sankyo a one-time upfront licensing fee. Going forward, Daiichi Sankyo is eligible to receive certain future development, approval and sales milestone payments, as well as royalties related to IMU-856. Financial terms of the agreement have not been disclosed.
“Exercising this option is an important milestone, as it indicates that we are convinced of the preclinical safety profile of IMU-856 and are ready to take this program into phase 1 clinical trials, which we intend to initiate during the first half of 2020,” stated Daniel Vitt, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Immunic. “Our recently presented preclinical data reinforced our belief that IMU-856 has disease-modifying properties for a variety of intestinal diseases and demonstrates potential significant advantages over current immunosuppressive treatments which address inflammation while unintentionally decreasing the body’s immune surveillance. We are hopeful that the planned phase 1, single and multiple ascending dose studies will serve as a further important step in the development of IMU-856 as a safe treatment option for patients suffering from gastrointestinal diseases by restoring function to the intestinal barrier without impairing the immune system.”
“We are delighted that Immunic executed the option right for IMU-856,” said Junichi Koga, Senior Executive Officer and Global Head of R&amp;D, Daiichi Sankyo. “Daiichi Sankyo is committed to delivering innovative medicines to patients across the world as quickly as possible, either by ourselves or through strategic partnerships. We are confident that Immunic is our best partner and will rapidly drive the development of this novel compound for patients with intestinal diseases.”

<b>Berlin, January 9, 2020</b> – Bayer and Exscientia Ltd., a UK-based Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery company, have entered into a three-year, multi-target collaboration. The partners will work on early research projects combining Exscientia’s proprietary AI drug discovery platform and drug design know-how with Bayer’s data and drug discovery capabilities. They aim to identify and optimize novel lead structures for potential drug candidates to treat cardiovascular and oncological diseases. Exscientia may be eligible to receive up to EUR 240 million, including upfront and research payments, near term and clinical milestones. As part of the agreement, Exscientia may also receive sales royalties. Bayer owns the rights to novel lead structures generated as part of the collaboration.
AI has the potential to accelerate drug discovery and improve the drug development productivity in terms of quality, cost and cycle time. Up to now, it takes 12 to 15 years from early research to marketing approval of a new drug. The collaboration focuses on early stage research by using an AI-based algorithm to predict potential drug molecules. Exscientia’s AI-driven drug discovery technology provides novel chemical matter for difficult-to-address targets and could identify novel drug candidates more efficiently through less optimization cycles.
“We are driving forward digital transformation in R&amp;D as we believe that digital technologies such as AI can simplify and speed up the discovery and development of new drugs for patients,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG's Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “The collaboration with Exscientia is expected to help us to achieve project milestones earlier and at the same time accelerate timelines by enabling more precise identification of suitable drug targets and lead structures.”
“We’re delighted to collaborate with Bayer, a globally recognized pharmaceutical company who has already committed significant investment to treating challenging diseases,” said Professor Andrew Hopkins, CEO of Exscientia. “Since our pioneering Nature papers demonstrated the automated design of small-molecules, we have enhanced our platform and exemplified it commercially, by accelerating the discovery of future drug molecules with partners. We’re excited to now work with Bayer researchers to drive this transformational change in key therapeutic areas.”
The Pharmaceuticals Business Development &amp; Licensing team of Bayer facilitated this collaboration.

The revision to the strategic collaboration agreement includes a new joint development plan under which Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb will expand the active clinical development program for bempeg plus nivolumab from three ongoing registrational trials in first-line metastatic melanoma, first-line cisplatin-ineligible metastatic urothelial cancer and first-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to include two additional registrational trials in adjuvant melanoma and in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. In addition, a Phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion study will be initiated to evaluate bempeg plus nivolumab in combination with axitinib in first-line RCC in order to support a future registrational trial. The costs for these studies will be shared based upon the cost-sharing outlined in the terms of the original collaboration agreement. Also as part of the new strategic collaboration agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb will independently conduct and fund a Phase 1/2 dose optimization and expansion study in first-line non-small-cell lung cancer with bempeg and nivolumab<i>.</i>
“Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar view bempeg as an important asset and IL-2 as an important target,” said Fouad Namouni, M.D., head of oncology development, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “We look forward to expanding the registrational program currently underway for bempeg and are committed to the development of potential new combination therapies to address the unmet needs of patients living with cancer.”
“We are pleased to move forward with this new set of registrational trials for bempeg, including the addition of an important Phase 3 study in adjuvant melanoma which builds on the existing metastatic melanoma study and our Breakthrough Therapy Designation,” said Nektar President &amp; CEO Howard W. Robin. “We now have a comprehensive plan to target multiple indications and have the opportunity to continue to collaborate on development with other companies in indications outside of those in the BMS and Nektar joint development program.”
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Opdivo
</i></span></b><i>Opdivo</i> is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, <i>Opdivo</i> has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.
<i>Opdivo</i>’s leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the <i>Opdivo</i> clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The <i>Opdivo</i> trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from <i>Opdivo</i> across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
In July 2014, <i>Opdivo</i> was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. <i>Opdivo</i> is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Yervoy </i>combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Yervoy

CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. <i>Yervoy</i> binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <i>Yervoy</i> 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. <i>Yervoy</i> is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for <i>Yervoy</i> spanning multiple tumor types.

<b>Immune-Mediated Encephalitis</b>
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated encephalitis. Evaluation of patients with neurologic symptoms may include, but not be limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Withhold OPDIVO in patients with new-onset moderate to severe neurologic signs or symptoms and evaluate to rule out other causes. If other etiologies are ruled out, administer corticosteroids and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for immune-mediated encephalitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, encephalitis occurred in 0.2% (3/1994) of patients. Fatal limbic encephalitis occurred in one patient after 7.2 months of exposure despite discontinuation of OPDIVO and administration of corticosteroids. Encephalitis occurred in one patient receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg (0.2%) after 1.7 months of exposure. Encephalitis occurred in one RCC patient receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg (0.2%) after approximately 4 months of exposure. Encephalitis occurred in one MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patient (0.8%) receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg after 15 days of exposure.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in &lt;1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
<b>Infusion Reactions</b>
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in &lt;1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate study in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.
<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>
Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone</b>
In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
<b>Lactation</b>
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.

<p align=""left"">SAN CARLOS, Calif., Jan. 12, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: IOVA), a late-stage biotechnology company developing novel T cell-based cancer immunotherapies, today announced that the company has obtained a license from Novartis to develop and commercialize an antibody cytokine engrafted protein, referred to as IOV-3001. Under the agreement, Iovance will pay an upfront payment to Novartis as well as low single digit milestones involved in initiation of patient dosing in various phases of clinical development for IOV-3001 and approval of the product in the U.S., EU and Japan. Novartis is also entitled to low-to-mid single digit royalties from commercial sales of the product.</p>
“As we progress our development efforts to commercialize TIL, we continue exploring ways to optimize the TIL treatment regimen which includes administration of IL-2,” said Maria Fardis, Ph.D., MBA, Iovance’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We therefore see a great strategic and long-term fit for Iovance to pursue development of a targeted and selective IL-2 analog with better pharmacokinetic properties. This product further adds to our research efforts in making safe and more potent TIL products with the potential opportunity for chronic administration.”
IOV-3001 is an engineered IL-2 CDR graft which targets IL2R beta-gamma-expressing cells and limits IL2R alpha-beta-gamma-dependent Treg activation. The protein has an improved half-life leading to a better exposure while minimizing Cmax possibly reducing the side effects associated with IL-2 protein. Iovance will focus on GMP manufacturing of IOV-3001 during 2020 and may initiate IND-enabling activities as early as 2021.
<strong>About Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc.</strong>
Iovance Biotherapeutics aims to improve patient care by making T cell-based immunotherapies broadly accessible for the treatment of patients with solid tumors and blood cancers. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy uses a patient’s own immune cells to attack cancer. TIL cells are extracted from a patient’s own tumor tissue, expanded through a proprietary process, and infused back into the patient. After infusion, TIL reach tumor tissue, where they attack tumor cells. The company is currently conducting pivotal studies in patients with metastatic melanoma and advanced cervical cancer. In addition, the company’s TIL therapies are being investigated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic cancers including head and neck and non-small cell lung cancer. A clinical study to investigate Iovance’s T cell therapy for blood cancers called peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) therapy is being initiated.

<h3><b><i>Submission based on Phase III PAOLA-1 trial for patients with advanced
ovarian cancer regardless of biomarker status or surgical outcome
</i></b></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced that a supplemental New Drug Application for <i>Lynparza</i> (olaparib) in combination with bevacizumab has been accepted and granted Priority Review in the US for the maintenance treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who are in complete or partial response to 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab.
A Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date is set for the second quarter of 2020.
The Priority Review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on results from the pivotal Phase III PAOLA-1 trial, which were published in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1911361"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>. The trial compared <i>Lynparza</i> when added to standard-of-care (SoC) bevacizumab vs. bevacizumab alone in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in the 1st-line maintenance setting, regardless of their biomarker status or outcome from previous surgery.<i></i>
The investigator-assessed results showed <i>Lynparza</i> added to bevacizumab reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 41% based on a hazard ratio of 0.59 (p&lt;0.0001) and improved progression-free survival (PFS) to a median of 22.1 months vs. 16.6 months for patients treated with bevacizumab alone.
At two years after trial initiation, 46% of patients treated with <i>Lynparza</i> added to bevacizumab showed no disease progression vs. 28% of patients treated with bevacizumab alone. The safety and tolerability profiles of <i>Lynparza</i> and bevacizumab were consistent with previous trials for each medicine and showed no detriment to quality of life.
<i>Lynparza </i>is the only PARP inhibitor with two positive randomised Phase III trials in the 1st-line maintenance setting for advanced ovarian cancer. It is the only PARP inhibitor <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2018/lynparza-approved-by-us-fda-for-1st-line-maintenance-therapy-in-brca-mutated-advanced-ovarian-cancer19122018.html"">approved in the US</a> as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for patients with BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer, based on the SOLO-1 trial. If approved, this would be the fourth indication for ovarian cancer patients in the US for <i>Lynparza</i>.
<b>Ovarian cancer</b>
Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide. In 2018, there were nearly 300,000 new cases diagnosed and around 185,000 deaths.<sup>1</sup> Most women are diagnosed with advanced (Stage III or IV) ovarian cancer and have a five-year survival rate of approximately 30%.<sup>2</sup> For newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, the primary aim of treatment is to delay progression of the disease for as long as possible and maintain the patient’s quality of life with the intent of achieving complete remission or cure.<sup>3,4,5,6</sup>
<b>PAOLA-1</b>
PAOLA-1 is a double-blind Phase III trial testing the efficacy and safety of <i>Lynparza</i> added to standard-of-care bevacizumab vs. bevacizumab alone, as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for newly diagnosed advanced FIGO Stage III-IV high-grade serous or endometroid ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer patients who had a complete or partial response to 1st-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab.
Results showed <i>Lynparza </i>added to bevacizumab demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 41% and improving PFS to a median of 22.1 months versus 16.6 months for those treated with bevacizumab alone (HR 0.59 [95% CI, 0.49-0.72], p&lt;0.0001). The sensitivity analysis of blinded independent central review (BICR) of PFS was consistent, showing a similar improvement with a median of 26.1 months for <i>Lynparza</i> added to bevacizumab vs. 18.3 months for bevacizumab alone (HR 0.63 [95% CI, 0.51-0.77], p&lt;0.0001).
Overall Grade 3 or above adverse events (AEs) were 57% for <i>Lynparza</i> added to bevacizumab and 51% for bevacizumab alone. The most common AEs =20% were nausea (53%), fatigue (53%), hypertension (46%), anaemia (41%), lymphopenia (24%), vomiting (22%) and arthralgia (22%). Grade 3 or above AEs were hypertension (19%), anaemia (17%), lymphopenia (7%), neutropenia (6%), fatigue (5%), nausea (2%), diarrhoea (2%), leukopenia (2%) vomiting (1%) and abdominal pain (1%). AEs led to dose interruption in 54% of patients on <i>Lynparza</i> added to bevacizumab while 20% of patients discontinued treatment.
PAOLA-1 is an ENGOT (European Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups) trial, sponsored by ARCAGY Research (Association de Recherche sur les CAncers dont GYnécologiques) on behalf of GINECO (Groupe d’Investigateurs National des Etudes des Cancers Ovariens et du sein). ARCAGY-GINECO is an academic group specialising in clinical and translational research in patients’ cancers and a member of the GCIG (Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup).
<b><i>Lynparza</i></b>
<i>Lynparza </i>(olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair, such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with <i>Lynparza</i> leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. <i>Lynparza </i>is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.
<i>Lynparza</i> is currently approved in 65 countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, regardless of BRCA status. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in 44 countries, including the US and Japan, for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. It is approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in other jurisdictions for ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancers.
<i>Lynparza</i>, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, is approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic pancreatic cancer and has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. <i>Lynparza</i> has the broadest and most advanced clinical-trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. <i>Lynparza</i> is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.
<b>The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration</b>
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise <i>Lynparza</i>, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.
<b>AstraZeneca in oncology</b>

MorphoSys AG (FSE: MOR; Prime Standard Segment; MDAX &amp; TecDAX; NASDAQ: MOR) and Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY) announced today that the companies have entered into a collaboration and license agreement to further develop and commercialize MorphoSys' proprietary anti-CD19 antibody tafasitamab (MOR208) globally. Tafasitamab is an Fc-engineered antibody against CD19 currently in clinical development for the treatment of B cell malignancies. MorphoSys and Incyte will co-commercialize tafasitamab in the U.S., while Incyte has exclusive commercialization rights outside of the U.S.
""The global partnership with Incyte is an important step towards unlocking the full potential of tafasitamab and achieving our goal of rapidly bringing tafasitamab to patients inside and outside of the U.S.,"" said Jean-Paul Kress, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of MorphoSys. ""The combination of our strong antibody and drug development expertise partnered with Incyte's well-established hematology-oncology experience and their commercial operations in key territories has the potential to significantly broaden the tafasitamab opportunity. We are pleased to work with Incyte to jointly improve the lives of patients suffering from DLBCL and other devastating diseases.""
""Bringing together Incyte's expertise and MorphoSys' commitment to innovation will allow us to make tafasitamab widely available to patients with cancer, upon approval,"" said Hervé Hoppenot, CEO of Incyte. ""We look forward to collaborating closely with the team at MorphoSys and adding tafasitamab to our portfolio of oncology candidates as part of our committment to bringing new, advanced treatment options to patients and the clinical community around the world.""
Under the terms of the agreement, MorphoSys will receive an upfront payment of $750 million and, in addition, Incyte will make an equity investment into MorphoSys of $150 million in new American Depositary Shares (ADS) of MorphoSys at a premium to the share price at signing of the agreement. Depending on the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, MorphoSys will be eligible to receive milestone payments amounting to up to $1.1 billion. MorphoSys will also receive tiered royalties on ex-U.S. net sales of tafasitamab in a mid-teens to mid-twenties percentage range of net sales.
In the U.S., MorphoSys and Incyte will co-commercialize tafasitamab, with MorphoSys leading the commercialization strategy and booking all revenues from sales of tafasitamab. Incyte and MorphoSys will be jointly responsible for commercialization activities in the U.S. and will share profits and losses on a 50:50 basis. Outside the U.S., Incyte will have exclusive commercialization rights, and will lead the commercialization strategy and book all revenues from sales of tafasitamab, paying MorphoSys royalties on ex-U.S. net sales.
Furthermore, the companies will share development costs associated with global and U.S.-specific trials at a rate of 55% (Incyte) to 45% (MorphoSys); Incyte will cover 100% of the future development costs for trials that are specific to ex-U.S. countries.
Both parties have agreed to co-develop tafasitamab broadly in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL), frontline DLBCL as well as additional indications beyond DLBCL, such as follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Incyte will be responsible for initiating a combination study of its investigational PI3K-delta inhibitor parsaclisib and tafasitamab in r/r B cell malignancies. Further, Incyte will be responsible for leading any potential registration-enabling studies in CLL and a phase 3 trial in r/r FL/MZL. MorphoSys will continue to be responsible for its currently ongoing clinical trials of tafasitamab in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), CLL, r/r DLBCL and frontline DLBCL. The parties will share responsibility in starting additional global trials, and Incyte intends to pursue development in additional territories including Japan and China.
MorphoSys recently submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) for tafasitamab, in combination with lenalidomide, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of r/r DLBCL; the FDA decision regarding a potential approval is expected by mid-2020. The submission of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in r/r DLBCL is planned for mid-2020.
The agreement between MorphoSys and Incyte, including the equity investment, is subject to clearance by the U.S. antitrust authorities under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act as well as by the German and Austrian antitrust authorities, and will become effective as soon as these conditions have been met.
MorphoSys and Incyte will host a joint conference call on January 13, 2020 at 7:00am PST/ 4:00pm CET.

<u>About Tafasitamab</u>
Tafasitamab is an investigational humanized Fc-engineered monoclonal antibody directed against CD19. In 2010, MorphoSys licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize tafasitamab from Xencor, Inc. Tafasitamab incorporates an XmAb(R) engineered Fc domain, which is intended to lead to a significant potentiation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), thus aiming to improve a key mechanism of tumor cell killing. MorphoSys is clinically investigating tafasitamab as a therapeutic option in B cell malignancies in a number of ongoing combination trials. An open-label phase 2 combination trial (L-MIND study) is investigating the safety and efficacy of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Based on interim data from L-MIND, in October 2017 the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tafasitamab plus lenalidomide in this patient population. Re-MIND, the real-world data lenalidomide alone matched control cohort met its primary endpoint in October 2019, demonstrating clinical superiority of the tafasitamab/lenalidomide combination compared to lenalidomide alone. The ongoing phase 3 study B-MIND assesses the combination of tafasitamab and bendamustine versus rituximab and bendamustine in r/r DLBCL. In addition, tafasitamab is currently being investigated in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL after discontinuation of a prior Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy (e.g. ibrutinib) in combination with idelalisib or venetoclax.

</ul>
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced an agreement to acquire from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) PF-05251749, a novel CNS-penetrant small molecule inhibitor of casein kinase 1 (CK1), for the potential treatment of patients with behavioral and neurological symptoms across various psychiatric and neurological diseases. In particular, Biogen plans to develop the Phase 1 asset for the treatment of Sundowning in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Irregular Sleep Wake Rhythm Disorder (ISWRD) in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The purchase will include an upfront payment of $75 million with up to $635 million in potential additional development and commercialization milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties in the high single digits to sub-teens.
“This asset is highly complementary to our existing pipeline of potential disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases,” said Alfred Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer at Biogen. “Many patients with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s suffer from debilitating sleep disorders and agitation, and we believe that the regulation of the circadian rhythm may hold promise in addressing these challenging behavioral and neurological symptoms.”
CK1 is a key regulator of the ‘central clock,’ the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, that controls circadian rhythm and impacts nearly all vital physiology and metabolism. The disruption of circadian rhythm is associated with various psychiatric and neurological diseases, including certain important symptoms of AD and PD.
Sundowning is a symptom that impacts 20% or more of AD patients who become confused, anxious, aggressive, agitated or restless later in the day. ISWRD is a circadian rhythm disorder where patients experience fragmented nighttime sleep leading to daytime sleepiness, severe fatigue and difficulty with activities of daily living. It is one of the non-motor symptoms of PD, and usually increases in frequency over the course of the disease and disability progression. Biogen will explore the potential of PF-05251749 to improve behavioral disturbances of Sundowning in AD by correcting circadian rhythm, as well as its potential to treat symptoms of ISWRD to improve daytime wakefulness, sleep quality, behavior and daily function.
PF-05251749 has previously demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and proof of mechanism in a Phase 1a clinical study. Biogen aims to initiate a Phase 1b study in Q4 2020.
This transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the United States.
Biogen expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2020.

– Expands EUSA’s global product offering; broadens BeiGene’s portfolio –

HEMEL HEMPSTEAD, England and CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and BEIJING, China, Jan. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — EUSA Pharma (EUSA) and BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160) today announced that they have entered into an exclusive development and commercialization agreement for the orphan biologic products SYLVANT® (siltuximab) and QARZIBA®? (dinutuximab beta) in Greater China.

Under the terms of the agreement, EUSA has granted BeiGene exclusive rights to SYLVANT® in Greater China and to QARZIBA®?in mainland China. Under the agreement, BeiGene will fund and undertake all clinical development and regulatory submissions in the territories, and will launch and commercialize both products once approved. EUSA will receive an upfront payment and be eligible to receive payments upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones up to a total of $160 million. EUSA will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on future product sales.

“Our teams are excited to work with EUSA to commercialize SYLVANT and QARZIBA, two important biologics which are already available to patients with rare diseases outside of China,” said Xiaobin Wu, Ph.D., General Manager of China and President of BeiGene. “This collaboration further demonstrates our commitment to bringing high quality therapies to people in China and around the world.”

Lee Morley, Chief Executive Officer of EUSA Pharma, said, “This exclusive agreement with BeiGene represents an important milestone for EUSA as we deliver on our promise to bring our innovative cancer and rare disease therapies to patients around the world. BeiGene brings to our collaboration exceptional development and commercialization capabilities in China and a clear focus on delivering innovative, targeted oncology medicines. We look forward to working together over the coming months to ensure these important orphan products are made available to Chinese patients.”

SYLVANT® is currently approved in more than 40 countries worldwide for the treatment of idiopathic multicentric Castleman’s disease (iMCD), a rare, life-threatening and debilitating orphan condition of the lymph nodes and related tissues. QARZIBA®? is the only EMA approved targeted immunotherapy for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma, an aggressive neoplasm and the most common childhood solid tumor that originates outside of the brain. Both products have been listed for fast-track approval in China by the National Medical Products Administration(NMPA) via its Review and Approval Procedures for Urgently-Needed Pharmaceutical Drugs Developed Overseas.

Jefferies International Limited acted as exclusive advisor to EUSA on the transaction.

About QARZIBA®? (dinutuximab beta)

QARZIBA®? is a monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed against the carbohydrate moiety of disialoganglioside 2 (GD2), which is overexpressed on neuroblastoma cells. Dinutuximab beta was approved by the European Commission in 2017 and is indicated for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above, who have previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, followed by myeloablative therapy and stem cell transplantation, as well as patients with history of relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma, with or without residual disease. Prior to the treatment of relapsed neuroblastoma, any actively progressing disease should be stabilised by other suitable measures. In patients with a history of relapsed/refractory disease and in patients who have not achieved a complete response after first line therapy, dinutuximab beta should be combined with interleukin-2 (IL-2).

About SYLVANT® (siltuximab)

SYLVANT® is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the action of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a multifunctional cytokine detected at elevated levels in iMCD patients. SYLVANT® is approved in a number of jurisdictions and indicated for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. iMCD is a rare, life-threatening and debilitating lymphoproliferative disorder, which causes abnormal overgrowth of immune cells and shares many symptomatic and histological features with lymphoma.

<b>Agreement Includes an Option for Rituxan® Biosimilar</b>
<p align=""left"">REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Jan. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (“Coherus” or the “Company”, Nasdaq: CHRS), today announced the Company has entered into a licensing agreement with Innovent Biologics, (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., (“Innovent”), a leading biopharmaceutical company headquartered in China, to commercialize Innovent’s biosimilar candidate to Avastin<sup>®</sup> (bevacizumab) in the United States and Canada. Coherus plans to file a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in late 2020 or early 2021 depending on FDA interaction timing, and to launch directly upon approval. The Company anticipates completing a single dose pharmacokinetic clinical study and certain analytical/bioanalytical exercises to support the U.S. filing. Innovent’s Avastin biosimilar successfully completed a large Phase 3 safety and efficacy study in China, and the application was filed for approval and was accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) in China in January 2019, and subsequently granted priority review status. Also, under the terms of the agreement, Coherus acquired an option to commercialize Innovent’s biosimilar to Rituxan<sup>®</sup> (rituximab) in the United States and Canada. Innovent’s Rituxan biosimilar was filed for approval and accepted by the NMPA in China in June 2019, and subsequently granted priority review status.</p>
<p align=""left"">The agreement furthers the Company’s previously-stated strategic objective to expand its oncology franchise and leverage its commercial infrastructure in the United States. Coherus expects to apply its biosimilar regulatory expertise to convert the Chinese regulatory filing into a FDA biologics application.</p>
<p align=""left"">“We are excited to enter into a strategic collaboration with one of the premier Chinese biologics companies,” said Denny Lanfear, Chairman and Chief Executive of Coherus. “Innovent is an impressive fully-integrated organization delivering substantial benefits to the healthcare system and patients in China with their first approved and successfully commercialized PD-1. Its oncology therapeutics complement UDENYCA<sup>®</sup> and advance our core mission to expand choice, improve patient access and lower healthcare costs in the United States.”</p>
<p align=""left"">“UDENYCA<sup>®</sup> has been the most successful biosimilar launch in the United States and has made Coherus the obvious partner of choice,” said Michael Yu, Ph.D., Founder, Chairman and CEO of Innovent. “Coherus and Innovent share a very similar mission, vision and set of values. We are pleased and proud to be working together.”</p>
<p align=""left"">Oncology is one of three focus areas for the Company along with ophthalmology and immunology. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Coherus announced it had acquired rights to commercialize BioEq’s Lucentis<sup>®</sup> biosimilar in the United States, the lead asset in Coherus’ ophthalmology franchise.</p>
<p align=""left"">According to the terms of the agreement with Innovent, Coherus will pay up to $45 million in milestones, including the upfront, for its Avastin biosimilar upon achieving certain regulatory and commercialization goals, as well as customary double-digit royalty payments. Financial terms for Innovent’s Rituxan biosimilar will be the same when optioned.</p>

<strong> </strong>
Basel, 13 January 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that it has entered into a 15-year, non-exclusive partnership with Illumina to broaden the adoption of distributable next-generation sequencing (NGS) based testing in oncology. As the understanding of the genomic drivers of cancer evolves, NGS has the potential to transform cancer risk prediction, detection, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring.
This agreement brings together complementary capabilities of each company to broaden global adoption of NGS in cancer care. As part of the agreement, Illumina will grant Roche rights to develop and distribute in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests on Illumina’s NextSeq™ 550Dx System, as well as on its future portfolio of diagnostic (Dx) sequencing systems. Roche will in turn collaborate with Illumina to complement Illumina’s comprehensive pan-cancer assay TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO 500) with new companion diagnostic (CDx) claims. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Under the IVD terms of the agreement, Roche will develop, manufacture and commercialise AVENIO IVD tests for both tissue and blood for use on Illumina’s NextSeq 550Dx System. Illumina will continue to sell the NextSeq 550Dx Systems and core sequencing consumables. Under the CDx terms of the agreement, Roche and Illumina will develop and pursue CDx claims on TSO 500 for both existing and pipeline Roche oncology targeted therapies on the NextSeq 550Dx System. Illumina will lead the development and regulatory approval process and will continue to manufacture, supply and commercialise TSO 500. Roche will support the development of the claims and regulatory filings.
“As a leader in diagnostic innovation that helps save and improve lives, Roche is pleased to enter into a collaboration agreement with Illumina to leverage our combined expertise in clinical oncology and next-generation sequencing,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “This collaboration is uniquely positioned to improve medical value and clinical decision making globally by combining the unique capabilities of the Roche Group including Foundation Medicine with Illumina and will provide more patients with access to NGS to characterise their disease and identify the right treatment for them. This builds upon our strategy of accelerating clinical research, streamlining workflows and expanding assay menus to broaden access to genomic data and lower barriers to routine use.”

TOKYO, PHILADELPHIA and OXFORDSHIRE, United Kingdom, Jan. 14, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., ""Astellas""), through its wholly-owned subsidiary Universal Cells, Inc, and Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq:ADAP), a leader in cell therapy to treat cancer, announced that they have entered into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement to bring new stem-cell derived allogeneic T-cell therapies to people with cancer.
Astellas and Adaptimmune will agree on up to three targets and co-develop T-cell therapy candidates directed to those targets. These targets will exclude target specific T-cell products in pre-clinical or clinical trials or those developed for other partners at Adaptimmune. The collaboration will leverage Adaptimmune's target identification and validation capabilities for generating target-specific T-cell Receptors (TCRs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and HLA-independent TCRs that recognize surface epitopes independently of the HLA profile of the tumor cell. The collaboration will also utilize Astellas’ Universal Donor Cell and Gene Editing Platform it obtained through the acquisition of Seattle-based Universal Cells.
Adaptimmune has been collaborating with Universal Cells (now an Astellas Company) since 2015 on development of gene-edited iPSC cell lines, for which Adaptimmune has rights to develop and commercialize resulting T-cell therapy products using its proprietary process for generating T-cells from stem cells without the use of feeder cell lines.
Astellas will fund research up until completion of a Phase 1 trial for each candidate. Upon completion of the Phase 1 trial for each candidate, Astellas and Adaptimmune will elect whether to progress with co-development and co-commercialization of the candidate, or to allow the other Party to pursue the candidate independently through a milestone and royalty bearing licence, with the agreement allowing for either company to opt out. The companies will each have a co-exclusive licence covering the co-development and co-commercialization of the product candidates within the field of T-cell therapy. If a candidate is developed by one company only, the appropriate licences will become exclusive to the continuing party.
""Astellas positions immuno-oncology as one of its strategic areas of primary focus, and it is engaged in the development of novel therapies for cancer patients using a new modality/technology,"" stated Naoki Okamura, Representative Director Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Astellas. ""In addition to NK cells, T-cells are an important component of cell therapy for immuno-oncology, and we look forward that this agreement with Adaptimmune will enable us to create new stem-cell derived allogeneic T-cell therapies for a variety of cancers, including solid tumors, in the future. We will continue to dedicate our efforts in delivering novel treatments for diseases with high unmet medical needs, pursuing cutting-edge science and technological advances.”
“We are delighted to establish this significant co-development partnership with Astellas, which builds upon and substantially extends an existing collaboration focused on gene editing of iPSC cells,” said Helen Tayton-Martin, Adaptimmune’s Chief Business Officer and Co-Founder. “This new collaboration may encompass both CAR-T and TCR T-cell approaches, including our novel HLA-independent TCR (“HiT”) platform. It brings together highly complementary skills and expertise across the two organizations, and will enable the accelerated development of new, off-the-shelf T-cell therapy products for people with cancer.”
Astellas will also have the right to select two targets and develop allogeneic cell therapy candidates independently. Astellas will have sole rights to develop and commercialize these products, subject to necessary licenses and the payment of milestones and royalties.
Under the terms of the agreement, Adaptimmune may receive up to $897.5 million in payments, including:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>an upfront payment of $50 million.</li>
 	<li>development milestones totalling up to $73.75 million for each product if the collaboration product discovered in this partnership is co-developed and commercialized by both companies</li>
 	<li>Up to $147.5 million in milestone payments per product and up to $110 million in sales milestones for products developed unilaterally by Astellas.</li>
</ul>
In addition, Adaptimmune will receive research funding of up to $7.5 million per year.
Finally, Adaptimmune would receive tiered royalties on net sales in the mid-single to mid-teen digits.
Under the terms of the agreement, Astellas may receive up to $552.5 million, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Up to $147.5 million in milestone payments per product and up to $110 million in sales milestones for products developed unilaterally by Adaptimmune.</li>
</ul>
In addition, Astellas would receive tiered royalties on net sales in the mid-single to mid-teen digits.
To the extent that Astellas and Adaptimmune co-develop and co-commercialize any T-cell therapy, they will equally share the costs of such co-development and co-commercialization, with the resulting profits from co-commercialization also shared equally. Further details governing co-development and co-commercialization will be articulated in a product-specific commercialization agreement.
The impact of this transaction on Astellas’ financial results in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 will be limited.

<b>First Company Developing a KRAS(G12C) Inhibitor to Announce Multi-Platform Companion Diagnostics</b><b>Collaborations With Guardant Health and QIAGEN Will Develop Blood- and Tissue-Based Companion Diagnostics For Investigational KRAS(G12C) Inhibitor AMG 510</b><b>KRAS G12C is Present in 13% of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers With no Approved Targeted Treatments</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Jan. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) today announced strategic collaborations with leading diagnostic companies Guardant Health, Inc. and QIAGEN N.V. to develop blood- and tissue-based companion diagnostics (CDx), respectively, for investigational cancer treatment AMG 510. AMG 510 is the first KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor to advance to the clinic for investigation in treatment of multiple tumor types. <i>KRAS G12C </i>is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers. The agreements with both companies will initially focus on CDx tests for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but allow for further development of the diagnostic tests for Amgen's other oncology clinical development programs.
""Amgen is committed to driving broad accessibility to biomarker testing in order to select appropriate patients who will directly benefit from targeted treatments,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""With one in eight patients with NSCLC having <i>KRAS G12C,</i> there's a critical need to improve access to high quality diagnostics and more routine screening. Collaborating with QIAGEN and Guardant Health to have both tissue- and blood-based diagnostic tests available will help to identify patients with NSCLC who may benefit from AMG 510.""
Amgen will work with QIAGEN to develop a tissue-based diagnostic test utilizing its <i>therascreen</i><sup>®</sup> platform to identify patients whose cancers have the <i>KRAS G12C</i> mutation. QIAGEN will also pursue global regulatory approvals, including Pre-Market Approval (PMA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To enable biomarker testing in patients for whom insufficient tissue remains a challenge, Amgen is also collaborating with Guardant Health to develop a liquid biopsy CDx. Guardant360 CDx is a multi-tumor comprehensive NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) test that is being developed to identify patients with actionable alterations, in this instance with the <i>KRAS G12C</i> mutation in NSCLC. Guardant Health will seek global regulatory approvals for the test, including a PMA from the FDA.
AMG 510 is currently enrolling patients in a potentially registrational Phase 2 study (CodeBreak™ 100). The FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to AMG 510 for previously treated metastatic NSCLC and colorectal cancer with <i>KRAS G12C</i> mutation and Fast Track Designation for previously treated metastatic NSCLC with <i>KRAS G12C</i> mutation.
Amgen established <i>RAS</i> as the first actionable biomarker in metastatic colorectal cancer and is now pioneering the development of <i>KRAS</i> mutation specific inhibitors in lung cancer and other solid tumors with AMG 510.
<b>About <i>KRAS</i>                 </b>
The subject of almost four decades of research, the <i>RAS</i> gene family are the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers.<sup>1,2</sup> Within this family, <i>KRAS</i> is the most prevalent variant and is particularly common in solid tumors.<sup>2 </sup>A specific mutation known as <i>KRAS G12C</i> is found in approximately 13% of non-small cell lung cancers, three to five percent of colorectal cancers and one to two percent of numerous other solid tumors.<sup>3</sup> KRAS<sup>G12C </sup>has been considered ""undruggable"" due to a lack of traditional small molecule binding pockets on the protein.<sup>4</sup>Amgen is exploring the potential of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition across a broad variety of tumor types.

<b>Forward-Looking Statements</b>
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaboration with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd., or the Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.
Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies or products, and to integrate the operations of companies or in support of products we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.
The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

<p align=""justify"">NEW YORK, Jan. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: AXSM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, has entered into an agreement with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) for an exclusive U.S. license to Pfizer’s clinical and nonclinical data, and intellectual property for reboxetine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in AXS-12 which Axsome is developing for the treatment of narcolepsy. The agreement also provides Axsome exclusive rights to develop and commercialize esreboxetine, a new late-stage product candidate now referred to as AXS-14, in the U.S. for the treatment of fibromyalgia.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the terms of the agreement, Axsome will receive from Pfizer an exclusive U.S. license to Pfizer data for reboxetine and esreboxetine encompassing a full range of nonclinical studies, and short-term and long-term clinical trials involving more than five thousand patients. The licensed data includes results of a positive Phase 3 and a positive Phase 2 trial of esreboxetine in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Axsome will have the exclusive right and sole responsibility of developing AXS-14 (esreboxetine) in the U.S. for the treatment of fibromyalgia and for other indications.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Pfizer will receive shares of Axsome common stock having a value of $8 million, based on the average closing price of Axsome’s common stock for the 10 prior trading days, in consideration for the license and rights. Pfizer will also receive an upfront cash payment of $3 million, up to $323 million in regulatory and sales milestones, and tiered mid-single to low double-digit royalties on future sales. Pfizer will also have a right of first negotiation on any potential future strategic transactions involving AXS-12 and AXS-14.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Axsome recently completed and announced positive results for a Phase 2 trial of AXS-12 in the treatment of narcolepsy and is preparing to advance AXS-12 into Phase 3 trials for the treatment of narcolepsy in 2020, as previously disclosed.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are very pleased to announce this agreement with Pfizer to help advance the development of AXS-12 for the treatment of narcolepsy and of AXS-14 for the treatment of fibromyalgia, two serious CNS disorders which currently have limited treatment options,” said Herriot Tabuteau, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Axsome. “The valuable clinical and nonclinical data under this exclusive license will enable us to potentially significantly accelerate our AXS-12 clinical program while reducing development risk and costs. Furthermore, through this agreement, we are able to expand our CNS pipeline with AXS-14, which has demonstrated efficacy in completed Phase 3 and Phase 2 trials in fibromyalgia. With the recently announced Phase 2 success of AXS-12 resulting in its planned advancement to Phase 3 this year, and with the addition of AXS-14, our pipeline will now contain four differentiated Phase 3-stage product candidates with the potential to positively affect many of the millions of people living with distressing CNS disorders.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Summary of the Agreement</strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><em>Reboxetine (AXS-12) </em></p>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Axsome will receive from Pfizer an exclusive U.S. license to data from a full range of nonclinical studies with reboxetine, to data from numerous short-term and long-term clinical trials of patients treated with reboxetine, and to other reboxetine intellectual property. Reboxetine is not approved in the U.S. for any indication and is marketed by Pfizer outside of the U.S. for the treatment of depression.</li>
 	<li>Reboxetine is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in AXS-12 which is being developed for the treatment of narcolepsy. Axsome recently completed and announced positive results for a Phase 2 trial of AXS-12 in the treatment of narcolepsy, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in cataplexy, excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as cognitive function compared to placebo. Axsome is preparing to initiate Phase 3 trials of AXS-12 in the treatment of narcolepsy in 2020, as previously disclosed.</li>
 	<li>The licensed nonclinical and clinical data are expected to reduce or eliminate the need for Axsome to conduct certain studies thereby mitigating risk and associated costs, and potentially significantly accelerating the clinical development and commercialization timelines of AXS-12.</li>
 	<li>Axsome has Orphan Drug Designation for AXS-12 in the treatment of narcolepsy, and 2 pending U.S. patents covering AXS-12.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify""><em>Esreboxetine (AXS-14) </em></p>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Axsome will receive from Pfizer an exclusive license to develop and commercialize esreboxetine, now referred to as AXS-14, in the U.S. for fibromyalgia and all other indications. The license encompasses nonclinical and clinical data for esreboxetine including results from a positive Phase 3 and a positive Phase 2 trial of esreboxetine in the treatment of fibromyalgia conducted by Pfizer.</li>
 	<li>Esreboxetine, the SS-enantiomer of racemic reboxetine, is the more selective and potent enantiomer, which has been evaluated for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, depression, and cognitive impairment. The condition affects approximately 5 million Americans of whom approximately 90% are women. It is considered to be mediated mainly in the CNS. Treatment options for fibromyalgia are limited with only three pharmacologic treatments currently approved by the FDA.</li>
 	<li>In a Phase 3 trial conducted by Pfizer in 1,122 patients with fibromyalgia treated with esreboxetine or placebo for 14 weeks, the study met the two primary endpoints demonstrating statistically significant improvements compared to placebo in the weekly mean pain score (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, and p=0.025, for 4 mg, 8 mg and 10 mg daily doses, respectively), and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, and p=0.023, for 4 mg, 8 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively). Esreboxetine also resulted in statistically significant improvements as compared to placebo on the Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scale (p=0.002, p=0.001, and p=0.007, for 4 mg, 8 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively), and in fatigue as measured using the Global Fatigue Index (p=0.001 and p=0.001, for 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses, respectively).<sup>1</sup></li>
 	<li>In a Phase 2 trial conducted by Pfizer in 267 patients with fibromyalgia treated with esreboxetine (dose escalated to 8 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks, the study met its primary endpoint demonstrating statistically significant improvements compared to placebo in the weekly mean pain score (p=0.006).  The study also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in additional efficacy outcomes including the FIQ total score (p&lt;0.001), the PGIC scale (p&lt;0.001), and fatigue as measured using the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale (p&lt;0.001).<sup>2</sup></li>
 	<li>AXS-14 expands Axsome’s late-stage pipeline of product candidates for difficult-to-treat CNS disorders.</li>
 	<li>Axsome has 3 pending U.S. patents covering AXS-14.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify""><em>Financial Terms </em></p>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Pfizer will receive shares of Axsome common stock having a value of $8 million, based on the average closing price of Axsome’s common stock for the 10 prior trading days. Pfizer will also receive an upfront cash payment of $3 million.</li>
 	<li>Pfizer will receive up to $323 million in regulatory and sales milestones, and tiered mid-single to low double-digit royalties on future sales.</li>
 	<li>Pfizer will have a right of first negotiation on any potential future strategic transactions involving AXS-12 or AXS-14.</li>

<p align=""justify""><strong>About Narcolepsy</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Narcolepsy can be a serious and debilitating neurological condition that causes dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle and is characterized clinically by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. Narcolepsy afflicts an estimated 185,000 individuals in the U.S. Cataplexy is seen in an estimated 70% of narcolepsy patients and is a sudden reduction or loss of muscle tone while a patient is awake, typically triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, fear, anger, stress, or excitement. Narcolepsy interferes with cognitive, psychological, and social functioning, increases the risk of work- and driving-related accidents, and is associated with a 1.5 fold higher mortality rate. Depression is reported in up to 57% of patients.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Fibromyalgia</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder often characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, depression, and cognitive impairment. Other symptoms of this disorder can include tingling in the hands and feet and headaches. Fibromyalgia is considered to be mediated mainly in the central nervous system. Approximately 5 million Americans, 90% of whom are women, are estimated to suffer from fibromyalgia. Treatment options for fibromyalgia are limited with only three pharmacologic treatments currently approved by the FDA.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About AXS-12</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">AXS-12 (reboxetine) is a highly selective and potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of narcolepsy. AXS-12 modulates noradrenergic activity to promote wakefulness, maintain muscle tone and enhance cognition. AXS-12 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of narcolepsy. AXS-12 is an investigational drug product not approved by the FDA.</p>

<div class=""introtext"">Underlining Bayer's commitment in the field of women's health / Potential commercial milestone payments of up to USD 310 million and tiered royalties on net sales in the double-digit range</div>
<div>
<p class=""bodytext""><strong>Berlin, January 13, 2020</strong> - Bayer announced today that it signed a license agreement with Daré Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ:DARE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the advancement of innovative products for women's health, under which Bayer may commercialize Daré's investigational contraceptive product, Ovaprene® in the United States once approved by the FDA.
""At Bayer we are committed to augmenting our organic growth through strategic collaborations, option and licensing agreements"" said Dr. Marianne De Backer, Member of the Executive Committee and Head of Business Development &amp; Licensing, Pharmaceuticals Division of Bayer AG. ""As a recognized leader in Women's Health, the collaboration with Daré Bioscience on Ovaprene represents an excellent strategic fit with our vision to continue to offer differentiated contraceptive choices to women.""
Ovaprene is an investigational hormone-free monthly vaginal contraceptive currently in clinical development for the prevention of pregnancy. If approved, it could be the first monthly non-hormonal contraceptive product.
Under the agreement, Daré will receive an upfront payment and access to Bayer's clinical and market capabilities while retaining control over Ovaprene's development and regulatory approval process. Bayer receives the right to obtain exclusive rights to commercialize the product in the U.S. following completion of the pivotal clinical trial being undertaken by Daré. The licensing option becomes effective with a payment of USD 20 million from Bayer to Daré. Daré might be eligible to receive commercial milestone payments potentially totaling USD 310 million as well as double-digit tiered royalties on net sales.
Daré plans to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for Ovaprene in the first half of 2020 and, pending the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's review and clearance of the IDE, to initiate a pivotal contraceptive effectiveness and safety clinical study of Ovaprene in the second half of 2020. If successful, Daré expects that study to support marketing approvals of Ovaprene in the U.S., Europe and other countries worldwide.
The Pharmaceuticals Business Development &amp; Licensing team of Bayer facilitated this collaboration.

<p class=""prntac""><i>XOSPATA is the first and only targeted treatment approved by Health Canada for patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia with a FLT3 mutation</i><i>. <br class=""dnr"" /></i><i>The </i><i>approval of XOSPATA marks Astellas' Canadian entry into the treatment of blood cancers</i><i>.</i></p>
<span class=""xn-location"">MARKHAM, ON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Jan. 14, 2020</span> /CNW/ - Astellas Pharma Canada, Inc., announced that Health Canada has approved the oral once-daily therapy XOSPATA (gilteritinib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed (disease that has returned) or refractory (resistant to treatment) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation. Gilteritinib has the potential to improve treatment outcomes for AML patients with two forms of the most common mutation—FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation.<sup>1,2</sup>
AML is a cancer of the bone marrow and the blood and progresses rapidly without treatment.<sup>3</sup> There are limited options for patients once they have relapsed or are refractory.<sup>4</sup>
""AML is a life-threatening cancer with an overall five-year survival rate in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> of only about 20 per cent,"" says Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Andre Schuh</span>, Hematologist and Clinical Researcher at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in <span class=""xn-location"">Toronto</span>. ""Retreatment of relapsed AML is particularly difficult, especially in the presence of a FLT3 mutation. The approval of XOSPATA is one of the few advances in the treatment of AML over the past 40 years and provides a new option for patients with a FLT3 mutation, potentially leading to both disease remission and significantly longer survival.""
AML can be diagnosed at any time, but is uncommon before the age of 45, with the average age of diagnosis being 68.<sup>5</sup>In 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, almost 1,090 Canadians were diagnosed with AML, while 1,184 died from AML in 2017. <sup>6</sup> FLT3 mutations are detected in approximately 30% of patients with AML.<sup>7</sup> However, a patient's FLT3 mutation status can change over the course of AML treatment, even after relapse. Due to the poor outcomes associated with FLT3 mutated AML, a patient's mutation status should be determined to help inform the best treatment approach.<sup>8,9,10</sup>
""Our mission at Astellas is to put the patients and their families at the centre of everything we do,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Steve Sabus</span>, General Manager, Astellas Pharma Canada, Inc. ""The approval of XOSPATA offers improved treatment outcomes and new hope to patients with FLT3 mutated AML. We're extremely proud to bring this targeted treatment to Canadian patients.""
<b>About Gilteritinib's Approval <br class=""dnr"" /></b>Health <span class=""xn-location"">Canada's</span> approval of gilteritinib is based on results from the Phase 3 ADMIRAL trial, which investigated gilteritinib versus salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3 mutated AML. Patients treated with gilteritinib had significantly longer overall survival (OS) than those who received salvage chemotherapy. Median OS for patients who received gilteritinib was 9.3 months, compared to 5.6 months for patients who received salvage chemotherapy (Hazard Ratio = 0.64 (95% CI 0.49, 0.83), P=0.0004). Rates of one-year survival were 37% for patients who received gilteritinib, compared to 17% for patients who received salvage chemotherapy. <sup>1,2</sup>
<b>About Gilteritinib<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Gilteritinib was discovered through a research collaboration with Kotobuki Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Astellas has exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize gilteritinib. Gilteritinib was approved in the U.S. and Japan in 2018, and <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> in 2019, for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory FLT3 mutated AML.<sup> 11,12,13</sup>
<b>About the ADMIRAL Trial<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The Phase 3 ADMIRAL trial was an open-label, multicenter, randomized study of gilteritinib versus salvage chemotherapy in adult patients with FLT3 mutation who are refractory to or have relapsed after first-line AML therapy. The co-primary endpoints of the trial were OS and CR/CRh rates; OS, the primary endpoint at the trial's final analysis, was the basis of the Health Canada's approval. The study enrolled 371 patients with relapsed or refractory AML and FLT3 mutation present in bone marrow or whole blood. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive gilteritinib (120 mg) or salvage chemotherapy.<sup>1,2</sup>
The most frequent adverse reactions (=10%) with Xospata were aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (37.6%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (37.6%), diarrhea (35.1%), fatigue (30.4%), nausea (29.8%), cough (28.2%), constipation (28.2%), peripheral edema (24.1%), dyspnea (24.1%), headache (23.5%), vomiting (21.0%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (20.7%), dizziness (20.4%), hypotension (17.2%), decreased appetite (17.2%), rash (15.0%), stomatitis (13.5%), abdominal pain (13.2%), dysgeusia (11.0%).<sup>1</sup>

<strong>Issued: Japan and UK</strong>
ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, announced that it has obtained approval of Dovato (dolutegravir 50 mg/lamivudine 300 mg) from the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg, to be administered orally, with or without food.<sup>[1]</sup>
Dovato is a once-daily, single-pill, 2-drug regimen (2DR) for treatment-naïve HIV infection that combines dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor (INI), with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) lamivudine.<sup>[2]</sup>
<strong>Dustin Haines, President, ViiV Healthcare Japan said</strong>: “In Japan, the standard of care for treatment-naïve people living with HIV has been for many years with a three-drug regimen. The data from our dolutegravir-based 2-drug regimen development programme has, however, challenged this.With the authorisation of Dovato, people living with HIV in Japan can - for the first time - start treatment on a once-daily, single-pill, 2-drug regimen with the knowledge that efficacy is non-inferior to a three-drug regimen.”
<strong>Dr. Ichiro Koga, MD, Director Medical Affairs, ViiV Healthcare Japan said</strong>: “The authorisation of Dovato in Japan marks a significant development for people living with HIV. This treatment allows individuals to take a 2-drug regimen in a once-daily, single-pill with dolutegravir at its core. ViiV Healthcare’s ambition and innovative R&amp;D programme aim to reduce the number of HIV medicines people living with HIV take over a lifetime and Dovato is an important addition to our portfolio of medicines to help support this aim.”
Marketing Authorisation for Dovato is supported by data from the landmark global GEMINI 1 &amp; 2 studies that included more than 1,400 HIV-1 infected adults. In these studies, dolutegravir and lamivudine demonstrated non-inferior efficacy based on plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies per millilitre (c/mL), a standard measure of HIV control, at week 48 when compared to a three-drug regimen of dolutegravir and two NRTIs, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), in treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected adults. The safety results for dolutegravir and lamivudine seen in GEMINI 1 &amp; 2 were consistent with the product labelling for dolutegravir and lamivudine. Four patients (1%) in both the dolutegravir and lamivudine, and the dolutegravir and TDF/FTC, study arms experienced drug-related serious adverse events, and 15 patients (2%) in the dolutegravir and lamivudine arm and 16 patients (2%) in the dolutegravir and TDF/FTC arm had adverse events that led to discontinuation. The most common adverse reactions included headache, diarrhoea, nausea, insomnia, and fatigue. No patient who experienced virologic failure in either treatment arm developed treatment-emergent resistance also up to week 48.<sup>[3,4]</sup>
<strong>About Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) infection</strong>
HIV-1 infects human immune cells called CD4 T lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that plays a central role in the human immune system. CD4 T lymphocytes are destroyed gradually due to HIV infection, causing the patients’ immune functions to decline. Eventually, patients exhibit various types of opportunistic infections and malignant tumours as a complication, a condition referred to as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). According to a report by the MHLW’s Committee on AIDS Trends, a total of 940 people in Japan were reportedly diagnosed with HIV infection (without AIDS) in 2018, and 377 patients suffered AIDS at the time of HIV diagnosis in Japan. The total number of newly reported cases in 2018, therefore, came to be 1,317 patients. The cumulative number of cases that have been reported up to 2018 (excluding cases of infections caused by coagulation factor preparations) is 30,149.<sup>[5]</sup>
<strong>About Dovato (dolutegravir/lamivudine)</strong>
Dovato (dolutegravir/lamivudine) is a once-daily, single-pill, 2-drug regimen that combines the INI dolutegravir (Tivicay, 50 mg) with the NRTI lamivudine (Epivir, 300 mg).<sup>[2]</sup>
It is authorised in the EU for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg, with no known or suspected resistance to the INI class, or lamivudine.<sup>2</sup> In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised Dovato, a complete, once-daily, single-tablet regimen of dolutegravir 50 mg and lamivudine 300 mg for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults with no antiretroviral (ARV) treatment history and with no known resistance to either dolutegravir or lamivudine.<sup>[6]</sup>
Like a dolutegravir-based three-drug regimen, dolutegravir/lamivudine inhibits the viral cycle at two different sites. INIs, like dolutegravir, inhibit HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection. Lamivudine is an NRTI that works by interfering with the conversion of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which in turn stops the virus from multiplying.

<strong>Important Safety Information for Dovato (50mg dolutegravir/300mg lamivudine) tablets in Japan</strong>
<strong>The following ISI is based on the Highlights section of the Prescribing Information for Dovato. </strong>
<strong>Please consult the full Prescribing Information for all the labeled safety information for Dovato.</strong>
<strong>WARNINGS</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>For paediatric patients who may develop pancreatitis (paediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis, paediatric patients who are being treated concomitantly with drugs that are known to cause pancreatitis), Dovato should be used carefully only when there are no other sufficiently effective treatments. If symptoms or clinical signs suggestive of pancreatitis, such as severe abdominal pain, nausea / vomiting or increase in serum amylase, serum lipase or triglycerides, etc., administration of Dovato should be stopped immediately.</li>
 	<li>Because chronic hepatitis B may relapse in patients with complications of chronic hepatitis B upon discontinuation of lamivudine administration, adequate attention should be paid when the administration of Dovato is discontinued. This relapse may have severe consequences in patients with decompensated liver disease.</li>
</ul>
<strong>PRECAUTIONS CONCERNING INDICATION</strong>
Dovato should be used in patients with HIV infection who are anti-HIV treatment naïve
Dovato should be selected on the basis of viral resistance testing (genotypic or phenotypic analysis) if possible.
Since Dovato is a combination product containing fixed doses of dolutegravir and lamivudine, individual dolutegravir preparation (Tivicay Tablets) or lamivudine preparation (Epivir Tablets) should be used in patients with renal impairment (CLcr &lt; 50 mL/min) requiring dose adjustment of lamivudine.
<strong>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</strong>
For adults and children aged 12 years or older and weighing 40 kg or heavier, the usual dosage is one tablet (50 mg as dolutegravir and 300 mg as lamivudine) administered once daily orally with or without food.
<strong>PRECAUTIONS CONCERNING DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</strong>
Since Dovato is a drug that treats with one agent, do not use in combination of other anti-HIV drugs excluding the case in which additional administration of dolutegravir is required. When Dovato is used in combination with carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital or St. John's Wort-containing foods, dolutegravir 50 mg should be administered twice daily. In this case, the dolutegravir should be administered approximately 12 hours after the dosing of Dovato. Dovato contains fixed dose of lamivudine, do not administer lamivudine in combination in addition to Dovato.
<strong>Geriatric Use</strong>
Dovato should be administered with care while monitoring the patient's condition. Generally, elderly has lower physiological function (liver, renal, cardiac) so many of them have complications or concomitantly use other drugs. Lamivudine is mainly excreted from the kidney as parent drug. Since renal function is often reduced in elderly patients, the plasma drug concentration may persist at a high level.
<strong>DRUG INTERACTIONS</strong>
Dolutegravir is primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 and partially by CYP3A4. Also, dolutegravir inhibits Organic Cation Transporter 2 (OCT2) and Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion 1 (MATE1). Lamivudine is substrate for OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K.
<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>
The following adverse reactions may occur. Patients should be carefully monitored, and if any abnormalities are observed, appropriate measures such as discontinuing administration should be taken.
<strong>Clinically Significant Adverse Reactions</strong>
<strong>Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (frequency unknown)</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Serious blood disorders</li>
 	<li>Pancreatitis (frequency unknown)</li>
 	<li>Lactic acidosis (frequency unknown) and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (fatty liver) (0.1%)</li>
 	<li>Rhabdomyolysis (frequency unknown)</li>
 	<li>Neuropathy (frequency unknown), confusion state (frequency unknown), convulsion (frequency unknown)</li>
 	<li>Cardiac failure (frequency unknown)</li>

<b>About JAMP Pharma Group</b>
JAMP Pharma Group is a privately owned Canadian company headquartered in the Montréal area. Having sustained its phenomenal growth for more than 10 years, JAMP Pharma Group has a portfolio of more than 250 molecules and is the leader in product launches in the generic pharmaceutical industry in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> based on Health Canada approvals from January to <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2019</span>. The Group also has in excess of 160 products in its over-the-counter division with a diverse range of vitamin, supplement and natural product brands, as well as Orimed Pharma's prescription products.
<b>Biosimilar medicines in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span></b>
A biosimilar is a biologic drug that is highly similar to a reference biologic drug already authorized for sale and no longer protected by a patent. Health <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> regulates biosimilars as new drugs under the Food and Drugs Act and Food and Drug Regulations. Biosimilars are approved for sale based on the same rigorous regulatory standards for quality, efficacy and safety as all other biologic drugs.
Biosimilars are not the same as generic drugs. Generic drugs are small, chemically synthesized molecules containing medicinal ingredients identical to their reference products. A biosimilar and its reference biologic drug can be shown to be highly similar, but not identical. This is because biologic drugs are often large and complex molecules and made from living cells rather than chemicals. As a result, they are naturally variable.

The 50-week global study, called CHAMPION-ALS, will evaluate approximately 350 adults across a broad patient population, and the primary endpoint will be change in ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) score. Alexion submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) for ULTOMIRIS in ALS to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019 and plans to initiate the Phase 3 study this quarter.
“Given the significant need for new and improved treatments for ALS, we are committed to advancing this clinical program with urgency,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research &amp; Development at Alexion. “Based on preclinical data and the significant role complement activation is known to play in other neuromuscular diseases, we believe ULTOMIRIS has the potential to inhibit complement-mediated damage in people with ALS, which may slow disease progression. We thank the ALS community for their involvement in designing this Phase 3 program and look forward to continued close collaboration as we move it forward.”
“We’ve made great progress advancing ALS research in recent years, but there is still more work to be done to ensure patients benefit from these advances in the form of new treatments,” said Calaneet Balas, CEO and President of The ALS Association. “It’s great that Alexion, which has an established record of bringing new treatments to patients with devastating rare diseases, is joining the fight against ALS.”
<b>About the Phase 3 CHAMPION-ALS Study
</b>The Phase 3 CHAMPION-ALS trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter global study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ULTOMIRIS across a broad ALS population. The study will enroll approximately 350 adults with sporadic or familial ALS who have had disease onset (in the form of first motor symptoms) within the prior 36 months, demonstrate a slow vital capacity (SVC) of at least 65 percent predicted, and are not dependent on respiratory support.
Study participants will be randomized on a 2:1 basis to receive ULTOMIRIS or placebo every 8 weeks following an initial loading dose and may continue to receive their existing standard of care treatment for ALS. After 50 weeks, all patients will receive ULTOMIRIS in a 2-year open-label extension phase of the study. The study will be conducted at approximately 90 clinical trial sites across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.
The primary study endpoint will be change from baseline in ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) score. Secondary endpoints will include ventilation assistance-free survival (VAFS), respiratory capacity, muscle strength, neurofilament light chain (NfL) serum concentrations and safety.
<b>About ALS
</b>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of nerve cells (motor neurons) in the brain and the spinal cord that control muscles throughout the body. When the nerve cells die, the brain can no longer initiate and control muscle movement, which results in severe disability, paralysis and eventually death.
ALS is a relentlessly progressive disorder. People with ALS may lose the ability to speak, eat, move and breathe. The rate of progression between individuals is variable and the natural history generally reflects progressive worsening over time until death occurs. The average life expectancy from symptom onset is between two and five years. Currently approved medications may slow disease progression, but ALS management is mostly supportive, palliative and symptom based.
An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people are living with ALS across the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan. There are two different types of ALS, sporadic and familial. Sporadic, which is the most common form of the disease, accounts for 85 to 90 percent of cases and may affect anyone, anywhere. Familial ALS, the inherited form of the disease, accounts for 10 to 15 percent of cases.
<b>About ULTOMIRIS<sup>®</sup> (ravulizumab-cwvz)
</b>ULTOMIRIS<sup>®</sup> (ravulizumab-cwvz) is the first and only approved long-acting C5 complement inhibitor. It is administered intravenously every eight weeks or every four weeks for pediatric patients less than 20 kg, following a loading dose. ULTOMIRIS works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. The terminal complement cascade, when activated in an uncontrolled manner, plays a role in severe ultra-rare disorders. ULTOMIRIS is approved in the U.S., Japan, and the EU as a treatment for adults with PNH and in the U.S. for aHUS to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients.
<b>INDICATIONS &amp; IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ULTOMIRIS</b> <b>(ravulizumab-cwvz) 300 mg / 30 mL injection for intravenous use
INDICATIONS
</b>ULTOMIRIS is a prescription medicine called a monoclonal antibody. ULTOMIRIS is used to treat adults with a disease called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). ULTOMIRIS is used to treat adults and children 1 month of age and older with a disease called atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). ULTOMIRIS is not used in treating people with Shiga toxin E. coli related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). It is not known if ULTOMIRIS is safe and effective in children with PNH. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS is safe and effective in children younger than 1 month of age in aHUS.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
</b>ULTOMIRIS is a medicine that affects the immune system. ULTOMIRIS can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. ULTOMIRIS increases the chance of getting serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections. Meningococcal infections may quickly become life-threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early.
Meningococcal vaccines must be received at least 2 weeks before the first dose of ULTOMIRIS if one has not already had this vaccine. If one’s doctor decides that urgent treatment with ULTOMIRIS is needed, meningococcal vaccination should be administered as soon as possible. If one has not been vaccinated and ULTOMIRIS therapy must be initiated immediately, 2 weeks of antibiotics should also be administered with the vaccinations. If one had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, additional vaccination might be needed before starting ULTOMIRIS. One’s doctor will decide if additional meningococcal vaccination is needed. Meningococcal vaccines reduce the risk of meningococcal infection but do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Call one’s doctor or get emergency medical care right away if any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection occur: headache with nausea or vomiting, headache and fever, headache with a stiff neck or stiff back, fever, fever and a rash, confusion, muscle aches with flu-like symptoms, and eyes sensitive to light. One’s doctor will give a Patient Safety Card about the risk of meningococcal infection. Carry the card at all times during treatment and for 8 months after your the ULTOMIRIS dose.
ULTOMIRIS is only available through a program called the <b><a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fultomirisrems.com%2F&amp;esheet=52157943&amp;newsitemid=20200114005254&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=ULTOMIRIS+REMS&amp;index=2&amp;md5=6f8d9a7c209e469a6a0c2d5c9e04ecda"" rel=""nofollow"">ULTOMIRIS REMS</a> </b>.
ULTOMIRIS may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections. People who take ULTOMIRIS may have an increased risk of getting infections caused by <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> and <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>. Certain people may also have an increased risk of gonorrhea infection. To find out if one is at risk for gonorrhea infection, about gonorrhea prevention, and regular testing, talk to the doctor. Call the doctor right away if one has any new signs or symptoms of infection.
Do not receive ULTOMIRIS if one has a meningococcal infection, or has not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection unless the doctor decides that urgent treatment with ULTOMIRIS is needed.
Before one receives ULTOMIRIS, tell the doctor about all of the medical conditions, including if one: has an infection or fever, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS will harm an unborn baby. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS passes into the breast milk. One should not breastfeed during treatment and for 8 months after one’s final dose of ULTOMIRIS.
Tell the doctor about all the medicines one takes, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. ULTOMIRIS and other medicines can affect each other causing side effects. Know the medicines one takes and the vaccines one receives. Keep a list of them to show the doctor and pharmacist when one gets a new medicine.
If one has PNH and stops receiving ULTOMIRIS, the doctor will need to monitor closely for at least 16 weeks after one stops ULTOMIRIS. Stopping ULTOMIRIS may cause breakdown of the red blood cells due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen due to red blood cell breakdown include: drop in the red blood cell count, tiredness, blood in the urine, stomach-area (abdomen) pain, shortness of breath, blood clots, trouble swallowing, and erectile dysfunction (ED) in males. If one has aHUS, the doctor will need to monitor closely for at least 12 months after stopping treatment for signs of worsening aHUS symptoms or problems related to a type of abnormal clotting and breakdown of the red blood cells called thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Symptoms or problems that can happen with TMA may include: confusion or loss of consciousness, seizures, chest pain (angina), difficulty breathing, and blood clots or stroke. If one misses an ULTOMIRIS infusion, call the doctor right away.
ULTOMIRIS can cause serious side effects including infusion reactions. Infusion reactions may happen during one’s ULTOMIRIS infusion. Symptoms of an infusion reaction with ULTOMIRIS may include lower back pain, pain with the infusion, feeling faint or discomfort in the arms or legs. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if these symptoms develop, or any other symptoms during the ULTOMIRIS infusion that may mean one is having a serious infusion reaction, including: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, and feel faint or pass out. One’s doctor will treat the symptoms as needed.
The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people treated for PNH are upper respiratory infection and headache. The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people with aHUS are upper respiratory infections, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, high blood pressure, and fever.

TEL AVIV, Israel, Jan. 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- BioLineRx Ltd.(NASDAQ: BLRX) (TASE: BLRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology, today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to its lead oncology candidate, Motixafortide (BL-8040), for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, based on a positive opinion from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Last year, Motixafortide received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of Pancreatic Cancer from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
""The Orphan Drug status we received for Motixafortide, from both the US and European regulatory bodies, is of significant strategic importance for the development of our lead product for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, an extremely difficult to treat indication with a poor response to the currently available treatments,"" stated Philip Serlin, Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx. ""We recently reported very encouraging initial data from the triple combination arm of our ongoing Phase 2a COMBAT/KEYNOTE-202 study in second line metastatic pancreatic cancer patients, which served as the basis for this ODD, and we believe that this designation will maximize the potential to make this new treatment available for patients in the fastest way possible.""
Motixafortide is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2a study for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in combination with KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> and chemotherapy under a collaboration agreement with Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada).
The EMA grants orphan medicinal product designation to investigational drugs intended to treat, prevent or diagnose a life-threatening or chronically debilitating disease affecting fewer than five in 10,000 people in the EU and for which no satisfactory treatment is available or, if such treatment exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal product designation provides regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies, including ten years of market exclusivity, protocol assistance, fee reductions and EU-funded research.
<strong>About Motixafortide in Cancer Immunotherapy</strong>
Motixafortide is targeting CXCR4, a chemokine receptor and a well validated therapeutic target that is over-expressed in many human cancers including PDAC. CXCR4 plays a key role in tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis and therapeutic resistance, and CXCR4 overexpression has been shown to be correlated with poor prognosis.
Motixafortide is a short synthetic peptide used as a platform for cancer immunotherapy with unique features allowing it to function as a best-in-class antagonist of CXCR4. It shows high-affinity, long receptor occupancy and acts as an inverse agonist.
In a number of clinical and preclinical studies, Motixafortide has been shown to affect multiple modes of action in ""cold"" tumors, including immune cell trafficking, tumor infiltration by immune effector T cells, and reduction in immunosuppressive cells (such as MDSCs) within the tumor niche, turning ""cold"" tumors, such as pancreatic cancer, into ""hot"" (i.e., sensitizing them to immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy).
<strong>About Pancreatic Cancer</strong>
Pancreatic cancer has a low rate of early diagnosis and a poor prognosis. Its incidence rate in the US is estimated at 3.2% of new cancer cases. Each year, about 185,000 individuals globally are diagnosed with this condition, and an estimated 55,000 individuals were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the US during 2018. Symptoms are usually non-specific and as a result, pancreatic cancer is often not diagnosed until it reaches an advanced stage. Surgical resection does not offer adequate treatment since only 20% of patients have resectable tumors at the time of diagnosis. The overall five-year survival rate among all pancreatic cancer patients is 7-8%, which constitutes the highest mortality rate among solid tumor malignancies. The overall median survival is less than one year from diagnosis, highlighting the need for the development of new therapeutic options.
Despite advances in chemotherapeutics and immunotherapy, increases in median and overall survival rates in pancreatic cancer have been modest. Pancreatic cancer remains an area of unmet medical need, with no new approved therapies since the approval of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine (Abraxane<sup>®</sup>) for first-line treatment in 2013 and Onivyde<sup>®</sup> in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin for second-line treatment in 2015. The limited clinical benefits demonstrated by these existing standard treatment options reinforce the need for additional approaches.

</ul>
TOKYO and BASEL, Switzerland, Jan. 15, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dermavant Sciences, a dermatology-focused subsidiary of Roivant Sciences, announced today that it has entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Japan Tobacco Inc. (JT) for exclusive rights to develop, register and market tapinarof in Japan for the treatment of dermatological diseases and conditions, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Along with this agreement, JT has signed an exclusive license agreement with its subsidiary, Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Torii), for co-development and commercialization of tapinarof in Japan.
Tapinarof is a potential first-in-class, once-daily topical <em>therapeutic aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulating agent </em><em>(</em>TAMA), which Dermavant is developing for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. To date, over 1,400 subjects have participated in 12 clinical trials for tapinarof. Tapinarof is currently in Phase 3 trials for psoriasis in the U.S. (PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2), having previously demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant responses in Phase 2 trials for both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Assuming positive Phase 3 results, Dermavant expects to file a New Drug Application for tapinarof topical cream for the treatment of plaque psoriasis with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2021.
Under the terms of the license agreement, Dermavant will receive an upfront payment of $60 million and up to $53 million upon the achievement of certain development milestones for tapinarof for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. In addition, Dermavant will have the right to receive royalties based on product sales of tapinarof in the indications.   <strong> </strong>
“Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis affect millions of people worldwide, including nearly 13 million in Japan alone,” said Todd Zavodnick, Chief Executive Officer of Dermavant. “Having seen the very encouraging results from Phase 2b studies for tapinarof conducted in North America and Japan for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, we are grateful to partner with JT and its subsidiary, Torii, two prominent and well-respected leaders in dermatology. JT and Torii share our commitment to finding novel, safe, and effective treatment options for patients in Japan suffering from these debilitating immuno-dermatologic diseases.”
“We are excited to partner with Dermavant for the development and commercialization of tapinarof. We are encouraged with the progress of its clinical trials, and jointly we hope to offer more treatment options for patients suffering with dermatological conditions in Japan,” said Muneaki Fujimoto, President of Pharmaceutical Business, JT.
“Tapinarof demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant responses in five Phase 2 trials, where it met primary endpoints in both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis,” said April Armstrong, M.D., Professor of Dermatology and Associate Dean of Clinical Research at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. “Coupled with a favorable tolerability profile, I believe that tapinarof with its novel mechanism of action could be a first-in-class topical treatment alternative, if approved.”
<strong>About PSOARING</strong>
PSOARING is Dermavant’s pivotal Phase 3 psoriasis clinical program for tapinarof, which consists of two identical, multi-center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, parallel group studies—PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2—to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tapinarof cream 1% dosed once daily (QD) for 12 weeks versus vehicle in adult patients aged 18-75 years diagnosed with plaque psoriasis.
The primary endpoint of both studies will be a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score assessment of “clear” skin (score of 0) or “almost clear” skin (score of 1), plus at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline, at Week 12. Following the 12-week, vehicle-controlled portion of the PSOARING trials, patients have the option to enroll in a separate, open-label extension study for an additional 40 weeks of treatment.
<strong>About Psoriasis</strong>
Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by red patches and plaques with silver scales on the skin. Psoriasis affects approximately 8 million people in the U.S. and 125 million worldwide, representing approximately 2% of the total population.
The typical age of onset is 15–25 years, but psoriasis can develop at any age. People with psoriasis are at an increased risk of developing other chronic and serious health conditions. Comorbidities include psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and depression. Psoriasis has a significant impact on quality of life and on psychological health.
<strong>About Atopic Dermatitis</strong>
Atopic dermatitis (AD), commonly referred to as eczema, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that results in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin, often affecting the folds of the arms, back of the knees, hands, face, and neck. AD is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases, affecting over 28 million people in the U.S. alone and up to 10% of adults worldwide. AD occurs most frequently in children, affecting up to 30% worldwide.
People with AD are more likely to have other allergic conditions, like asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies. Itching is an especially bothersome symptom in AD, and tends to worsen at night, disturbing sleep and causing fatigue, which in children can lead to inattention at school. People with AD may also experience social and emotional distress due to the visibility and discomfort of the disease.

<strong>Mountain View, CA and San Diego, CA – January 13, 2020–</strong>
Livongo (Nasdaq: LVGO), a leading Applied Health Signals company empowering people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives, has partnered with Dexcom, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXCM), a leader in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), to offer Livongo Members the ability to synch data from their Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System with the Livongo platform, providing access to key insights and Health Nudges™ from Livongo’s Applied Health Signals platform based on their CGM data.
The Dexcom G6 system accurately measures glucose levels just beneath the surface of the skin and sends data wirelessly every five minutes. The G6 includes a slim, water-resistant sensor that is discreet, easy to insert, and is FDA-cleared to make diabetes treatment decisions without confirmatory fingersticks or calibration*. The system features customizable alarms and alerts to warn users of dangerous glucose levels, even while they are asleep.
“Combining Dexcom’s leading Continuous Glucose Monitoring technology with Livongo’s Applied Health Signals platform will give our Members the next level of vital data insights they need to effectively manage their diabetes and all aspects of their health,” said Livongo Chief Executive Officer Zane Burke. “As Livongo consistently delivers an industry leading Member experience, clinical outcomes, and validated costs savings, we continue to gain momentum in partnering with other innovative organizations across the healthcare ecosystem that enhance our AI+AI engine and provide an even better experience for our Members. Our new partnership with Dexcom is a significant step in our journey to make it easier for our Members to stay healthy.”
Through the partnership, Livongo can now aggregate data from the Dexcom G6, cross-reference with proprietary blood pressure and weight data from its connected devices, and then use advanced data science to interpret that data and offer Members personalized health insights, or Health Nudges, based on their comprehensive health profile. Joint Livongo and Dexcom Members will also have access to 24/7 support from Livongo’s certified health coaches.
“Together, Dexcom and Livongo provide the opportunity for people with diabetes to easily access the leading technology and insights they need to stay healthy,” said Kevin Sayer, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dexcom. “Through a careful combination of clinical expertise, data science, and human coaching, the combined solution offers our users an even greater ability to understand themselves, their conditions, and what they need to get and stay healthy.”
As of September 30, 2019, Livongo currently has more than 770 clients, including more than 20 percent of Fortune 500 companies, four of the top seven health plans, and two of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit managers as partners. A 2019 study in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company demonstrated that Livongo for Diabetes Members were more empowered and less distressed in diabetes self-management, when compared to non-Members. A separate 2019 <a title=""Journal of Medical Economics study"" href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13696998.2019.1609483"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Journal of Medical Economics study</a> found that the Livongo for Diabetes program delivered an $88 per member monthly reduction in medical spending for Livongo Members and that employers experienced a positive return on investment in one year[1].

<span class=""xn-location"">OAKVILLE, ON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Jan. 15, 2020</span> /CNW/ - UCB Canada Inc. announced today that Health Canada has approved CIMZIA<sup>® </sup>(certolizumab pegol) for the treatment of adults with severe active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and / or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).<sup>1</sup>
A chronic inflammatory condition, nr-axSpA mainly affects the spine and sacroiliac joints and is often undiagnosed and not appropriately treated. In nr-axSpA, definitive evidence of the disease is not evident on an x-ray. Disease onset typically begins in early adulthood and causes chronic and debilitating back pain, stiffness and fatigue, often having a profound impact on patients' lives.
""We're pleased to see this important advance for the spondyloarthritis community. Greater awareness, earlier diagnosis and more treatment options will help deliver better outcomes for Canadians living with this painful disease which often falls through the cracks, and carries with it a significant burden,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Gerald Major</span>, President, Canadian Spondylitis Association.
The approval marks the fifth indication for CIMZIA, which is the only Fc-free, PEGylated anti-TNF option available for the treatment of the disease where significant unmet need currently exists.
A treatment that is Fc-free is an important consideration for patients with chronic inflammatory diseases who are pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant due to concerns of placental transfer<i>.</i><i><sup>2</sup></i>
Because it does not have an IgG Fc region, CIMZIA does not bind the neonatal Fc receptor, and therefore would not be anticipated to undergo neonatal Fc receptor-mediated transfer across the placenta<i>.</i><i><sup>3</sup></i>
""The journey patients face from symptom onset to diagnosis and receiving appropriate treatment can be extremely lengthy – sometimes up to 10 years. So having a new and effective option for nr-axSpA is welcome news, both for those suffering and their physicians who are seeking a proven treatment to reduce the severe pain, stiffness, and other burdensome symptoms of the disease,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Walter Maksymowych</span>, MD, FRCPC, FACP, Professor and Medical Scientist in the Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology at the <span class=""xn-org"">University of Alberta</span>.
""Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis can often be misdiagnosed or there is a delay in diagnosis; but it's a severe, chronic, painful and progressive condition which can result in significant impairment. Given the tremendous burden to patients who are often struck at the prime of their lives, having a new treatment option can help prompt improved awareness, diagnosis and, ultimately, outcomes,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Louis Bessette</span>, MD, MSc, FRCPC, Rheumatologist, CHU de <span class=""xn-location"">Quebec</span>, Assistant Professor, <span class=""xn-org"">Laval University</span>.
<b>About Spondyloarthritis</b><sup>4<br class=""dnr"" /></sup>Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a term used to describe a group of inflammatory arthritis diseases with common features, including inflammation of the spine, eyes, skin and gastrointestinal tract. Axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) affects the spine and sacroiliac joints (the joints between the pelvis and the sacrum or base of the spine).
About 90% of people who develop spondyloarthritis will carry the HLA-B27 gene. People who have a family member with spondyloarthritis are at higher risk of developing the disease, depending on whether they inherited the HLA-B27 gene. The frequency of ankylosing spondylitis is about 0.50% of the population (1 in every 200). The frequency of axial spondyloarthritis is about 1.4% of the population.
<b>About Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Non-radiographic-axSpA and AS share similar symptomatology and disease burden. In AS there is definitive structural damage in the sacroiliac joints detectable by x-ray. In nr-axSpA, there is no definitive radiographic sacroiliitis, though more sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) testing may detect evidence of active sacroiliitis, visible as inflammation in the sacroiliac joints. Historically, nr-axSpA has not been well-recognized due to a lack of understanding of the disease history, progression, and prognosis, resulting in substantial diagnostic delay.
Patients face a significant disease burden whether they have nr-axSpA (i.e., no definitive evidence of sacroiliitis on x-ray) or AS (i.e., definitive evidence of sacroiliitis on x-ray). They often experience substantial inflammatory back pain, prolonged and severe stiffness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, reduced physical function, decreased quality of life, impaired work and home productivity and social participation.
""The approval of CIMZIA for nr-axSpA is an important treatment advance which builds on more than a decade of market experience and proven efficacy and safety,"" said Lionel Houle, Head of Immunology, UCB Canada Inc. ""Today's announcement reflects our heritage of making a difference for specific patient populations with unmet needs.""
Health <span class=""xn-location"">Canada's</span> approval is based on data from C-AXSPAND<sup>5</sup>, a Phase 3, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study that randomized 317 adult patients to receive either CIMZIA or placebo plus common background medications, which included NSAIDs, corticosteroids, analgesics and slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs. The study met its primary endpoint, with 47.2% of patients treated with CIMZIA demonstrating major improvement response in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS-MI) at week 52, compared to 7.0% of patients treated with placebo. ASDAS-MI is a validated, rigorous response threshold, defined as an ASDAS decrease of at least two points from baseline or reaching the lowest possible value. C-AXSPAND is the first study to adopt this stringent threshold as a primary outcome measure. Detailed findings from the study were published online in <i>Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology</i> on <span class=""xn-chron"">March 8, 2019</span>.<sup>6</sup>
The study also met ASAS40, an important secondary endpoint, with 47.8% of CIMZIA-treated patients achieving a 40% improvement in Ankylosing Spondylitis Assessment Score (ASAS40) compared to 11.4% of placebo-treated patients at week 12.
The safety profile for patients with nr-axSpA treated with CIMZIA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and previous experience with CIMZIA.
The recommended dose of CIMZIA for adult patients with nr-axSpA is 400 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) initially and at weeks 2 and 4, followed by 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks.
<b>About CIMZIA in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span><sup>1<br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>CIMZIA is the only Fc-free, PEGylated anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor). CIMZIA has a high affinity for human TNF-alpha, selectively neutralizing the pathophysiological effects of TNFalpha.
CIMZIA in combination methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, and reducing the progression of joint damage as assessed by X-ray, in adult patients with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CIMZIA may be used alone for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with moderately- to -severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who do not tolerate MTX.
CIMZIA alone or in combination with MTX is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inhibiting the progression of structural damage as assessed by X-ray, in adult patients with moderately-to-severely active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who have failed one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
CIMZIA is also indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.
CIMZIA is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy.
CIMZIA is approved for the treatment of adults with severe active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and / or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The FDA has granted the application Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of May 15, 2020.
“The FDA’s acceptance of our application for <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy</i> represents an important milestone for patients with lung cancer in the United States, where, despite recent treatment advances, lung cancer remains the cause of more than 150,000 deaths each year,” said Sabine Maier, M.D., development lead, thoracic cancers, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “Lung cancer is the third tumor type where the combination of <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Yervoy</i> has demonstrated significant long-term overall survival benefit in a randomized Phase 3 trial, which further validates the immunologic rationale for dual Immuno-Oncology therapy.”
This application is based on data from Part 1 of the Phase 3 CheckMate -227 trial evaluating <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> versus chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated NSCLC, in which the dual immunotherapy combination demonstrated significant improvement in overall survival versus chemotherapy alone. The safety profile of <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> was consistent with previously reported studies and no new safety signals were observed.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CheckMate -227</span></b>
CheckMate -227 is a multi-part open-label Phase 3 trial evaluating <i>Opdivo</i>-based regimens versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy in patients with first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer across non-squamous and squamous tumor histologies:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Part 1:
<ul class=""bwlistcircle"">
 	<li>Part 1a: <i>Opdivo</i> plus low-dose <i>Yervoy</i> or <i>Opdivo</i> monotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1</li>
 	<li>Part 1b: <i>Opdivo</i> plus low-dose <i>Yervoy</i> or <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients whose tumors do not express PD-L1</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Part 2: <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1</li>
</ul>
There are two co-primary endpoints in Part 1 for <i>Opdivo </i>plus<i> Yervoy</i> (versus chemotherapy): overall survival (OS) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (assessed in patients enrolled in Part 1a) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with TMB =10 mut/Mb across the PD-L1 spectrum (assessed in patients enrolled across Parts 1a and 1b). Part 1 met both its co-primary endpoints of PFS with the <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy </i>combination versus chemotherapy in patients whose tumors have high (=10 mutations/megabase, mut/mb) TMB, regardless of PD-L1 expression, and OS demonstrating a superior benefit for <i>Opdivo</i> plus low-dose <i>Yervoy</i> versus chemotherapy in first-line NSCLC patients whose tumors express PD-L1 =1%. Part 2 did not meet its primary endpoint for OS for <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, in patients with non-squamous NSCLC.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Lung Cancer</span></b>
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common types of lung cancer and accounts for up to 85% of diagnoses. Survival rates vary depending on the stage and type of the cancer when diagnosed. For patients diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer, the five-year survival rate is approximately 5%.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">Bristol-Myers Squibb: Advancing Oncology Research</span></b>
At Bristol-Myers Squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. The focus of our research is to increase quality, long-term survival for patients and make cure a possibility. Through a unique multidisciplinary approach powered by translational science, we harness our deep scientific experience in oncology and Immuno-Oncology (I-O) research to identify novel treatments tailored to individual patient needs. Our researchers are developing a diverse, purposefully built pipeline designed to target different immune system pathways and address the complex and specific interactions between the tumor, its microenvironment and the immune system. We source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines, like I-O, a reality for patients.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Opdivo</i></span></b>
<i>Opdivo</i> is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, <i>Opdivo</i> has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.
<i>Opdivo</i>’s leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the <i>Opdivo</i> clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The <i>Opdivo</i> trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from <i>Opdivo</i> across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
In July 2014, <i>Opdivo</i> was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. <i>Opdivo</i> is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Yervoy </i>combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Yervoy</i></span></b>
<i>Yervoy</i> is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. <i>Yervoy</i> binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <i>Yervoy</i> 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. <i>Yervoy</i> is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for <i>Yervoy</i> spanning multiple tumor types.
<b>Indications and Important Safety Information for YERVOY<sup>® </sup>(ipilimumab)</b>
<b>Indications</b>
YERVOY® (ipilimumab) is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults and pediatric patients (12 years and older).
YERVOY® (ipilimumab) is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than 1 mm who have undergone complete resection, including total lymphadenectomy.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>
<b>WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>
<b>YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune-mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY.</b>
<b>Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy, and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests, at baseline and before each dose.</b>
<b>Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.</b>
<b>Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</b>
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and for symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or more severe pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold until resolution for Grade 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, fatal cases of immune-mediated pneumonitis have occurred. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 6% (25/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% (24/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.7% (2/119) of patients.
In Checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=12).
<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis</b>
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 (of more than 5 days duration), 3, or 4 colitis. Withhold OPDIVO monotherapy for Grade 2 or 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 or recurrent colitis upon re-initiation of OPDIVO. When administered with YERVOY, withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent colitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 26% (107/407) of patients including three fatal cases. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 10% (52/547) of patients.

<b>Immune-Mediated Encephalitis</b>
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated encephalitis. Evaluation of patients with neurologic symptoms may include, but not be limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Withhold OPDIVO in patients with new-onset moderate to severe neurologic signs or symptoms and evaluate to rule out other causes. If other etiologies are ruled out, administer corticosteroids and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for immune-mediated encephalitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, encephalitis occurred in 0.2% (3/1994) of patients. Fatal limbic encephalitis occurred in one patient after 7.2 months of exposure despite discontinuation of OPDIVO and administration of corticosteroids. Encephalitis occurred in one patient receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg (0.2%) after 1.7 months of exposure. Encephalitis occurred in one RCC patient receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg (0.2%) after approximately 4 months of exposure. Encephalitis occurred in one MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patient (0.8%) receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg after 15 days of exposure.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in &lt;1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
<b>Infusion Reactions</b>
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in &lt;1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate study in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.
<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>
Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone</b>
In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
<b>Lactation</b>
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.
<b>Serious Adverse Reactions</b>
In Checkmate 037, serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=268). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse drug reactions reported in 2% to &lt;5% of patients receiving OPDIVO were abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased lipase. In Checkmate 066, serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=206). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in =2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were gamma-glutamyltransferase increase (3.9%) and",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/BMS-16.jpg,Regulatory,BMS,Opdivo|nivolumab|Yervoy|ipilimumab,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Regulatory|1L|Acceptance|FDA|reports|sBLA|Treatment|US,publish,16-1-2020,2,,,,,,,,,,,

Mumbai, India, January 15, 2020 - Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Reuters: SUN.BO,
Bloomberg: SUNP IN, NSE: SUNPHARMA, BSE: 524715, “Sun Pharma” and includes its subsidiaries and/or associate companies) today announced that one of its wholly owned subsidiaries has entered into exclusive licensing and supply agreements with Rockwell Medical
Inc. (Rockwell), to commercialize Rockwell's Triferic, a proprietary iron replacement and haemoglobin maintenance drug, for treating anaemia in hemodialysis patients in India. Triferic is approved in USA.
As per the terms of the agreement, Sun Pharma will be the exclusive development and commercialization partner for Triferic during the term of the agreement, subject to its approval in India. In consideration for the license, Rockwell will be eligible for upfront and milestone payments as well as royalty on net sales. The financial terms of the agreement are
confidential.
Kirti Ganorkar, CEO of India business, Sun Pharma, said, “We are excited to build a partnership with Rockwell who has developed an innovative product, Triferic for haemodialysis patients. Triferic is an innovative anaemia therapy for the patients who are undergoing haemodialysis and offers a unique treatment option. Triferic will help Sun Pharma expand its portfolio in its
core therapy areas.”
According to the 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study, chronic kidney disease was the 10th leading cause of mortality in India, having risen from 14th rank in 20071 In India, there are approximately 130,000 patients receiving hemodialysis, and the number is increasing by about 232 per million population2
.
About Triferic
Triferic is the only USFDA-approved therapy in the U.S. indicated to replace iron and maintain haemoglobin in hemodialysis patients via dialysate during each dialysis treatment. Triferic has a unique and differentiated mechanism of action which has the potential to benefit patients and health care economics. Triferic represents a potential innovative medical advancement in hemodialysis patient iron management– with the potential to become the future standard of care. Triferic delivers approximately 5-7 mg iron with every hemodialysis treatment to the bone marrow and maintains haemoglobin without increasing iron stores (ferritin). Triferic donates iron immediately and completely to transferrin (carrier of iron in the body) upon entry into the blood and is then transported
directly to the bone marrow to be incorporated into hemoglobin, with no increase in ferritin (stored iron and inflammation) and no reports of anaphylaxis in over 1,000,000 patient administrations, addressing a significant medical need in overcoming Functional Iron Deficiency (FID) in End Stage Renal Disease patients.

ORLANDO – Biosimilar BI 695501 demonstrated non-inferior efficacy and similar safety profile compared with the reference product <a href=""https://www.empr.com/drug/humira/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label="" (opens in a new tab)"">adalimumab</a> in patients with active Crohn disease, according to research presented at the 2019 Advances in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (AIBD) Annual Meeting, held December 12-14, 2019 in Orlando, FL.
Investigators conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02871635"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label="" (opens in a new tab)"">Study 1297.4</a>) evaluating the efficacy and safety of BI 695501 compared with adalimumab reference product (RP) in patients with moderate to severe active Crohn disease for at least 4 months with evidence of mucosal ulceration. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clinical response, defined as Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) decrease of =70 from baseline, at Week 4. Safety profiles up to Week 24 were also analyzed and compared between the two patient groups.
Study findings showed that biosimilar BI 695501 is non-inferior to adalimumab RP in efficacy after 4 weeks of treatment. Patients in both groups demonstrated similar response rates, with 89.7% of patients with CDAI response in the BI 695501 group, compared with 94.4% of patients in the adalimumab RP group (RR 0.945; 90% CI: 0.870, 1.028). The investigators found similar safety profiles up to Week 24 between the two groups, with no unexpected safety findings.

<p align=""justify"">MAINZ, Germany and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 16, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech”) and Neon Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: NTGN, “Neon”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which BioNTech will acquire Neon in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $67.0 million. Neon is a biotechnology company developing novel neoantigen-based T cell therapies. Upon closing, it will operate as a subsidiary of BioNTech, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on patient-specific immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases. The transaction will combine two organizations with a common culture of pioneering translational science and a shared vision for the future of cancer immunotherapy.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“<em>This acquisition fits with our strategy to expand our capabilities and build our presence in the U.S. and further strengthens our immunotherapy pipeline,</em>” said Ugur Sahin, MD, Co-founder and CEO of BioNTech. “<em>I am particularly excited about the adoptive T cell and neoantigen TCR therapies being developed by Neon, which are complementary to our pipeline and our focus on solid tumors</em>.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“<em>We are very proud of all we have accomplished since we founded Neon and look forward to joining forces with BioNTech to continue to build a business that provides life-changing immunotherapy products to patients battling a variety of cancers,”</em> said Hugh O’Dowd, Chief Executive Officer of Neon.</p>

<strong>Transaction Details</strong>
<p align=""justify"">Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Neon will, following consummation of the acquisition, merge with Endor Lights, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of BioNTech and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioNTech. At closing, BioNTech will issue, and Neon shareholders will receive 0.063 American Depositary Shares (ADS) (each ADS representing one ordinary share of BioNTech) in exchange for each of their shares of Neon. The exchange ratio implies a deal value of $67 million, or $2.18 per share of Neon, based on the closing price of BioNTech’s ADSs of $34.55 on Wednesday, January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2020.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The transaction was unanimously approved by both BioNTech’s and Neon’s boards of directors. The transaction, which is expected to close during the second quarter of 2020, is subject to approval of Neon’s shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Certain stockholders of Neon owning approximately 36% of the outstanding Neon shares have entered into voting agreements, pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements, to vote in favor of the Neon acquisition.</p>

Celltrion said that it has presented the long-term follow-up results of its phase 3 clinical trial of Truxima in treating advanced follicular lymphoma (AFL) patients, at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2019 conference.
According to the company, it confirmed that Truxima showed similar efficacy and safety in treating AFL patients when compared to the original Rituxan.
The company treated 140 AFL patients with either Truxima or Rituxan, and the 40-month follow-up period showed similar overall survival (OS), progress-free survival (PFS), and time to progressive (TTP) in both drugs.
In detail, the trial results showed the OS estimates at four years for Truxima and Rituxan were 88 and 93.3 percent, respectively, while PFS was 60.9 and 54.7 percent, and TTP was 64.2 and 60.9 percent, respectively.
""Statistical validation confirmed that Truxima's efficacy and safety were similar to those of the original drug throughout the entire clinical period,"" a company official said. ""This clinical trial was conducted for 40 months on patients in India, Japan, Russia and the EU, including Germany and Spain.""
Based on these medical verifications, Truxima will significantly contribute to improving medical welfare and easing the financial burden of blood cancer patients worldwide, he added.
Professor Christian Buske at Germany's Comprehensive Cancer Center Ulm said, ""The trial is meaningful as it is the first long-term clinical results for rituximab biosimilars. As the long-term efficacy and safety similarities between Truxima and the original drug have been demonstrated, prescriptions are expected to increase.""
The company has launched Truxima in the United States through Teva, its North American distribution partner. Truxima is the first rituximab biosimilar in the U.S. market, which has an annual sale of about 5 trillion won ($4.2 billion).

<div class=""news-con-a""><strong>BEIJING, China – 30 December 2019</strong> – Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, today announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase III trial of SCB-808, a proposed biosimilar to Enbrel (etanercept) being developed in the prefilled syringe formulation for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
The Phase III, multi-center trial in China is designed to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of SCB-808 and originator drug Enbrel in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) via subcutaneous administration.
“The treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and other rheumatic diseases remains a high unmet medical need in China, as the majority of patients remain severely undertreated. Currently, the lack of affordable, convenient and high-quality biologics therapies presents a major hurdle to wide patient adoption and compliance,” said Dr. Feng Huang of Beijing 301 Hospital and leading principal investigator of this trial.  “My team and I look forward to evaluating SCB-808 as a potential new and convenient therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases in China.”
“We are excited to work with Dr. Huang and these world-class investigators and sites participating in this study,” said Dr. Min Dong, Executive Vice President, Global Clinical Development at Clover. “More importantly, we hope that SCB-808 will meaningfully impact the lives of many patients in China who suffer from autoimmune diseases, and the initiation of this Phase III trial brings us one step closer to this goal.”
Currently available etanercept biosimilars in China were all developed and approved prior to the implementation of the CFDA’s <em>Technical Guideline for Development and Evaluation of Biosimilars</em> and were not compared to the originator drug Enbrel in clinical trials to demonstrate their bioequivalence. Furthermore, they are currently only approved in the lyophilized powder formulation, which must be reconstituted typically by trained medical personnel before being subcutaneously injected into patients. SCB-808 is being developed in the prefilled syringe formulation, which is ready-for-injection and can potentially be self-administered by patients in the convenience of their own homes. Thus, in the Western world, ready-for-injection formulations constitute the overwhelming majority of Enbrel<sup>â</sup> prescriptions. As such, Clover’s SCB-808 has the potential to address the unmet needs of Chinese patients for this class of drugs.
“Having compared SCB-808 to both Enbrel and other Chinese etanercept biosimilars in preclinical studies, we believe that the advantages of our robust biomanufacturing process, head-to-head comparisons to Enbrel in clinical trials and the convenient ready-for-injection prefilled syringe formulation will allow us to potentially have meaningful commercial advantages once SCB-808 is brought to the market,” said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. “With a new state-of-the-art 35,000m<sup>2</sup> cGMP biomanufacturing facility, with initial 2 x 2,000L bioreactor capacity and further expandable, Clover certainly has the vision and capacity to make a positive impact on the millions of suffering autoimmune patients in China.”

“We are excited to work with Dr. Huang and these world-class investigators and sites participating in this study,” said Dr. Min Dong, Executive Vice President, Global Clinical Development at Clover. “More importantly, we hope that SCB-808 will meaningfully impact the lives of many patients in China who suffer from autoimmune diseases, and the initiation of this Phase III trial brings us one step closer to this goal.”
Currently available etanercept biosimilars in China were all developed and approved prior to the implementation of the CFDA’s <em>Technical Guideline for Development and Evaluation of Biosimilars</em> and were not compared to the originator drug Enbrel in clinical trials to demonstrate their bioequivalence. Furthermore, they are currently only approved in the lyophilized powder formulation, which must be reconstituted typically by trained medical personnel before being subcutaneously injected into patients. SCB-808 is being developed in the prefilled syringe formulation, which is ready-for-injection and can potentially be self-administered by patients in the convenience of their own homes. Thus, in the Western world, ready-for-injection formulations constitute the overwhelming majority of Enbrel<sup>â</sup> prescriptions. As such, Clover’s SCB-808 has the potential to address the unmet needs of Chinese patients for this class of drugs.
“Having compared SCB-808 to both Enbrel and other Chinese etanercept biosimilars in preclinical studies, we believe that the advantages of our robust biomanufacturing process, head-to-head comparisons to Enbrel in clinical trials and the convenient ready-for-injection prefilled syringe formulation will allow us to potentially have meaningful commercial advantages once SCB-808 is brought to the market,” said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. “With a new state-of-the-art 35,000m<sup>2</sup> cGMP biomanufacturing facility, with initial 2 x 2,000L bioreactor capacity and further expandable, Clover certainly has the vision and capacity to make a positive impact on the millions of suffering autoimmune patients in China.”

The World Health Organization (WHO) this week prequalified its first biosimilar. The product, Samsung Bioepis’ biosimilar trastuzumab, Ontruzant, referencing Herceptin, could now become available to more patients with <em>HER2-</em>positive cancer in low- and middle-income countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) this week prequalified its first biosimilar. The product, Samsung Bioepis’ biosimilar trastuzumab, Ontruzant, referencing Herceptin, could now become available to more patients with <em>HER2-</em>positive cancer in low- and middle-income countries.
Prequalification ensures that medicines supplied by international procurement agencies meet acceptable standards of quality, safety, and efficacy, and it gives the procurement agencies working to distribute drugs in resource-limited areas the choice of a range of medicines for bulk purchase. Many low-income countries use WHO’s list of prequalified products to guide their selection of medicines, and prequalification may also contribute to an increase in competition that reduces costs for these medicines.
“WHO prequalification of biosimilar trastuzumab is good news for women everywhere,” <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/18-12-2019-who-prequalifies-first-biosimilar-medicine-to-increase-worldwide-access-to-life-saving-breast-cancer-treatment"">said</a> Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, WHO’s director-general, in a statement. “Women in many cultures suffer from gender disparity when it comes to accessing health services. In poor countries, there is the added burden of a lack of access to treatment for many, and the high cost of medicines. Effective, affordable breast cancer treatment should be a right for all women, not the privilege of a few.”
The WHO noted that the biosimilar is being made available at price 65% lower than the global average cost of the originator drug, and with more products expected to enter the prequalification pipeline, competition could see prices drop even further. That could be key to ensuring access as the number of diagnoses of breast cancer rises; the WHO said that, by 2014, the number of patients diagnosed with breast cancer could reach 3.1 million, with most of those patients residing in low- and middle-income nations.
This week’s news is a major development after the WHO <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/news/who-to-start-pilot-prequalification-of-biosimilars-for-2-cancer-treatments"">announced</a> the pilot prequalification project in 2017 and invited drug makers to submit applications for their biosimilar versions of trastuzumab and rituximab (referencing the brand-name Rituxan).
The organization is also currently working on a pilot procedure for the prequalification of <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/news/who-launches-pilot-prequalification-for-human-insulin"">human insulin</a> as means to facilitate access to safe, effective, and quality-assured products for use in low-resource areas.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/samsung-bioepis-2.jpg,Biosimilars,Samsung Bioepis,Ontruzant,Biosimilars|Initiates|P-III|Trial,publish,20-12-2019,2,,,,,,,,,,,

<h3 id=""cz-sub""></h3>
<span class=""xn-location"">PLAINSBORO, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Jan. 16, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ <b>-- </b>Novo Nordisk today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new indication for Ozempic<sup>®</sup> (semaglutide) injection 0.5 mg or 1 mg to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as heart attack, stroke, or death in adults with type 2 diabetes and known heart disease.<sup>1</sup> Additional details were added to the Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> (semaglutide) tablets 7 mg or 14 mg Prescribing Information about the primary analysis for PIONEER 6.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of death and disability among people with type 2 diabetes.<sup>2</sup> Adults with type 2 diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop CVD than adults without diabetes.<sup>3</sup>
The FDA's decision on Ozempic<sup>®</sup> is based on results from the SUSTAIN 6 cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) which examined the cardiovascular safety of adding Ozempic<sup>®</sup> or placebo to standard of care in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. In the 2-year SUSTAIN 6 trial, Ozempic<sup>®</sup> significantly reduced the risk of the occurrence of a three-component MACE endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack or non-fatal stroke. The estimated relative risk reduction of MACE was 26% vs placebo (HR 0.74 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.95], p&lt;0.001 for noninferiority, median observation time 2.1 years) with the primary composite outcome occurring in 6.6% of patients treated with Ozempic<sup>®</sup> vs 8.9% with placebo.<sup>1,4</sup> During the trial, gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent in the Ozempic<sup>®</sup> group than in the placebo group. The majority of gastrointestinal adverse events occurred during the first 30 weeks.<sup>4</sup>
""There is a well-established link between cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. It's one of our biggest concerns with type 2 diabetes because even when patients reach their blood sugar targets, the risk of a major adverse CV event remains,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Todd Hobbs</span>, vice president and U.S. chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk. ""Today's milestone establishes Ozempic<sup>®</sup> as an option for patients to help address two critical aspects of managing type 2 diabetes, blood sugar control and cardiovascular risk reduction, in those with known heart disease.""
The Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> prescribing information has been updated in section 14 (clinical studies) to include an analysis from the primary endpoint of the PIONEER 6 CVOT showing the hazard ratio for time to first three-component MACE (HR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.57, 1.11]).<sup>5</sup>
In <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2019</span>, Novo Nordisk initiated the SOUL CVOT in 9,642 adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease to further evaluate the cardiovascular effect of Rybelsus<sup>®</sup>. The trial is investigating the effects of Rybelsus<sup>® </sup>on the incidence of MACE vs placebo in addition to standard of care.
<b>About the SUSTAIN 6 Trial
</b>SUSTAIN 6 was an event- and time-driven, pre-approval CVOT for Ozempic<sup>®</sup>. It was a randomized, double-blinded, noninferiority placebo-controlled trial evaluating the cardiovascular safety of Ozempic<sup>®</sup> vs placebo when added to standard of care in 3,297 adults with type 2 diabetes with established CVD for a minimum observation period of two years.

Chronic wounds are a global, silent epidemic, affecting tens of millions of people around the world. These are the wounds that don’t heal in a timely fashion, taking months or even years to heal. The toll these wounds take on the lives of patients is significant. Chronic wounds generally <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5259833/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">impact an already vulnerable, chronically ill, and older population</a> and can limit the mobility, social interaction, and mental health of patients.
In the United States, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19903300"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">6.5 million people</a> have chronic wounds, costing more than $25 billion annually. In the United Kingdom, some <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/29/uncomfortable-ugly-painful-the-hidden-health-crisis-hitting-2m-britons"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2.2 million people</a> suffer from such wounds. The cost of wound care to the National Health Service is over £5 billion every year—roughly <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-cancer-research-and-treatment/2010-to-2015-government-policy-cancer-research-and-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">the same as the cost of treating cancer</a>. The aging global population, the rise in the number of people living with diabetes (a third of wounds are caused by diabetic foot ulcers), and a surge in obesity levels have caused <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18293879"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">an increase in the prevalence of chronic wounds</a>, one that is expected to continue over the coming years.
Many studies have shown <a href=""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-importance-of-continuous-wound-measuring-Gethin/2ac4c6c7425588d52621bd33774bfc510ec8d233"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">the importance of continuous wound measurement to healing</a>. Nurses, already overextended, are on the front line of wound care, but the tools they are using for measuring and documenting chronic wounds are <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5585126/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">inconsistent and rudimentary</a>. Nurses often measure wounds with basic paper rulers, make a decision based on size, color and smell to gauge whether skin tissue is healing. Without an accurate method of record-keeping, clinicians struggle to share and track results over time, possibly leading to prolonged healing times, and growing distress for patients.

Using a smartphone app and two calibration stickers placed around a wound to track dimensions, clinicians can scan the wound and get a measurement quickly and effectively, eliminating human error and discrepancies. Wound images are automatically calibrated for size, depth, lighting, and dimensions to ensure that wound data is standardized across the board. Rather than simply capturing an image, our technology builds a 3D image enabling more comprehensive documentation.

Beyond the imaging component, the service enables the digitization of best practice guidelines for wound documentation. In order to maintain consistent documentation, nurses can specify different qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the wound, such as the wound’s location and the patient’s level of pain. Using the app, nurses can also document the administered treatment plan, reference past treatment and normalize past photos, and create a report summarising each wound’s progress over time. This data is automatically uploaded to the clinical record so that all clinicians involved in the care of the patient can see it.
Improving wound care is a national priority for the NHS, and our service is already being used in several clinics across the United Kingdom. Gill Cooper, RGN, Clinical Lead Nurse at Wokingham Medical Centre, where the service is used, says it has had a big impact:

<blockquote class=""elementor-blockquote"">
<p class=""elementor-blockquote__content"">“Patients now feel that the progress of their wounds is being tracked with photographs and they are also able to have a look at these and understand the progression/deterioration and we can discuss treatment together.
“The biggest impact for us is having photographs of the wound. It has given us the chance to review wounds and to think about the wound care before the patient even enters the room.”</p>

By streamlining documentation and providing automatic measurements of the wound over time, this service can promote evidence-based care decisions and reduce further complications, setting a new standard for wound care. This service will also help overburdened nurses objectively and consistently monitor their patients more efficiently over the course of treatment. And beyond facilitating care and healing for individual patients, precise measurement and tracking over time will help inform larger trends and understandings, helping clinicians use data to identify best practices for wound care and improve patient outcomes<b>.</b>

<h3><b><i>Submission based on PROfound, the first positive Phase III trial testing
a targeted treatment in biomarker-selected prostate cancer patients
</i></b></h3>

<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced that a supplemental New Drug Application for <i>Lynparza </i>(olaparib) has been accepted and granted Priority Review in the US for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations, who have progressed following prior treatment with a new hormonal agent.
A Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date is set for the second quarter of 2020.
The Priority Review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is based on results from the Phase III PROfound trial, which were <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/lynparza-more-than-doubled-the-time-without-disease-progression-in-patients-with-brca1-2-atm-mutated-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-30092019.html"">presented</a> during the Presidential Symposium at the 2019 European Society of Medical Oncology congress.
Results of the PROfound trial showed <i>Lynparza </i>significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 66% based on a hazard ratio of 0.34 (p&lt;0.0001) vs. abiraterone or enzalutamide in patients with BRCA1/2 or ATM-mutated mCRPC, the primary endpoint of the trial.
The trial also showed that <i>Lynparza</i> reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 51% based on a hazard ratio of 0.49 (p&lt;0.0001) vs. abiraterone or enzalutamide in the overall trial population of patients with HRR-mutated (HRRm) mCRPC (those with mutations in the genes for BRCA1/2, ATM, CDK12 or 11 other HRRm genes; key secondary endpoint). The safety and tolerability profile of <i>Lynparza</i> in the PROfound trial was in line with that observed in previous clinical trials.
<b>Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer</b>
Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer in men, with an estimated 1.3 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2018 and is associated with a significant mortality rate.<sup>1 </sup>Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone.<sup>2</sup> mCRPC occurs when prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones.<sup>2</sup> Approximately 10-20% of men with advanced prostate cancer will develop CRPC within five years, and at least 84% of these will have metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis.<sup>3</sup> Of men with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.<sup>3</sup> Despite an increase in the number of available therapies for men with mCRPC, five-year survival remains low.<sup>3</sup>
<b>PROfound</b>
PROfound is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase III trial testing the efficacy and safety of <i>Lynparza</i>versus new hormonal agents (e.g. abiraterone or enzalutamide) in patients with mCRPC who have progressed on prior treatment with new hormonal anticancer treatments and have a qualifying tumour mutation in one of 15 genes involved in the HRR pathway, including among them BRCA1/2, ATM and CDK12.
The trial was designed to analyse patients with HRRm genes in two cohorts: the primary endpoint was in those with mutations in BRCA1/2 or ATM genes and then, if <i>Lynparza</i> showed clinical benefit, a formal analysis was performed of the overall trial population of patients with HRRm genes (BRCA1/2, ATM, CDK12 and 11 other HRRm genes; key secondary endpoint).
Results showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement with <i>Lynparza</i> in the primary endpoint of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), improving the time patients with BRCA1/2- or ATM-mutated mCRPC lived without disease progression to a median of 7.4 months vs. 3.6 months for those treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 66% (HR 0.34 [95% CI, 0.25-0.47], p&lt;0.0001). The trial also met the key secondary endpoint of rPFS in the overall HRRm population, where <i>Lynparza</i> reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 51% and improved rPFS to a median of 5.8 months vs. 3.5 months for those receiving abiraterone or enzalutamide (HR 0.49 [95% CI, 0.38-0.63], p&lt;0.0001). PROfound is the first positive Phase III trial testing a targeted treatment in biomarker-selected prostate cancer patients.
The safety and tolerability profile of <i>Lynparza</i> in the PROfound trial was in line with that observed in prior clinical trials. The most common adverse events (AEs) =20% were anaemia (47%), nausea (41%), fatigue/asthenia (41%), decreased appetite (30%) and diarrhoea (21%). The most common Grade 3 or above AEs =1% were anaemia (22%), fatigue/asthenia (3%), vomiting (2%), dyspnoea (2%), urinary tract infection (2%), pulmonary embolism (2%), decreased appetite (1%), diarrhoea (1%), backpain (1%) and nausea (%). 16% of patients on <i>Lynparza</i> discontinued treatment due to AEs.
<b>HRR gene mutations</b>
HRR is a DNA repair process that allows for high-fidelity, error-free repair of damaged DNA, in the form of double-strand breaks and inter-strand crosslinks (amongst others).<sup>4,5</sup> The inability to properly repair DNA damage leads to genomic instability and contributes to cancer aetiology.<sup>5</sup> Deficiency in HRR leads to a compromised ability to repair damaged DNA, and is a feature of cancer cells that is a target for PARP inhibitors, such as <i>Lynparza</i>. PARP inhibitors block DNA damage repair by trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks which leads to replication fork stalling causing their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks which in turn lead to cancer cell death.<sup>4</sup>
<b><i>Lynparza</i></b>
<i>Lynparza </i>(olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair, such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with <i>Lynparza</i> leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. <i>Lynparza </i>is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.
<i>Lynparza</i> is currently approved in 65 countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, regardless of BRCA status. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in 44 countries, including the US and Japan, for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. It<i> </i>is approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in other jurisdictions for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.
<i>Lynparza</i>, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, is approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic pancreatic cancer and has been used to treat more than 30,000 patients worldwide. <i>Lynparza</i> has the broadest and most advanced clinical-trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. <i>Lynparza</i> is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.
<b>The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration</b>
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise <i>Lynparza</i>, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.
<b>AstraZeneca in oncology</b>
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With at least six new medicines to be launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

AstraZeneca’s <i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) and tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 antibody and potential new medicine, have both been granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in the US for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants ODD to medicines intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US.
Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide and for patients with unresectable or advanced disease, only 13% are alive five years after diagnosis.<sup>1-3</sup>
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “Many patients with liver cancer are diagnosed and treated only after the disease is advanced, and there is an urgent need for new effective and tolerable treatments. We are eager to bring new potential options to these patients and look forward to the results of our ongoing Phase III HIMALAYA trial later this year.”
The Phase III HIMALAYA trial is testing <i>Imfinzi</i> and the combination of <i>Imfinzi</i> plus tremelimumab in patients with unresectable, advanced HCC who have not been treated with prior systemic therapy and are not eligible for locoregional therapy (treatment localised to the liver). HIMALAYA is the first trial to test dual immune checkpoint blockade in the 1st-line advanced HCC setting.
<i>Imfinzi </i>is<i> </i>not currently approved to treat HCC in any country, alone or in combination with tremelimumab.

Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death and the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide.<sup>1</sup> HCC represents about 80% of all primary liver cancers.<sup>4</sup> Approximately 700,000 people were diagnosed with HCC around the world in 2018, and an estimated 42,000 people were diagnosed in the US last year.<sup>1,2</sup> Between 80-90% of all patients with HCC also have chronic liver disease, which is primarily caused by infection with the hepatitis B or C viruses.<sup>5,6</sup> Chronic liver disease is associated with inflammation that, over time, results in immunosuppression and can lead to the development of HCC.<sup>7,8</sup> The unique immune environment of liver cancer provides clear rationale for researching medicines that harness the power of the immune system to treat HCC.<sup>9</sup> A critical unmet need exists for patients with HCC who face limited treatment options.<sup>10</sup> More than half of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, often when symptoms first appear.<sup>11,12</sup>
<b>HIMALAYA</b>
HIMALAYA is a randomised, open-label, multicentre, global Phase III trial of <i>Imfinzi </i>monotherapy and the combination of <i>Imfinzi</i> and tremelimumab vs. the standard-of-care medicine sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, in patients with unresectable, advanced HCC who have not been treated with prior systemic therapy and are not eligible for locoregional therapy. The trial is being conducted in 189 centres across 16 countries including in the US, Canada, Europe, South America and Asia. The primary endpoint is overall survival and key secondary endpoints include objective response rate and progression-free survival.
<b><i>Imfinzi</i></b>
<i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.
<i>Imfinzi </i>is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after chemoradiation therapy in 54 countries, including the US, Japan, China and across the EU, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. <i>Imfinzi</i> is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in 11 countries, including the US.
<i>Imfinzi</i> is under Priority Review with FDA for the treatment of patients with previously untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in combination with chemotherapy. A Prescription Drug User Fee Act date is set for the first quarter of 2020.
As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi</i> is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.
<b>Tremelimumab</b>
Tremelimumab is a human monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine that targets the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death. Tremelimumab is being tested in a clinical trial programme in combination with <i>Imfinzi</i> in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and liver cancer.
<b>AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology (IO)</b>
Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca believes that IO-based therapies offer the potential for life-changing cancer treatments for the clear majority of patients.
The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes <i>Imfinzi</i> as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.
<b>AstraZeneca in Oncology</b>
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients' lives and the Company's future. With at least six new medicines to be launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca's main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.
By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

Zydus and China Medical System Holdings enter into a License Agreement for Desidustat in Greater China
• Desidustat, currently undergoing Phase III clinical development*# is a novel oral
HIF-PH inhibitor for treating Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients
• Agreement provides Zydus access to markets in Greater China, where more than 120
million patients are estimated to be living with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
Ahmedabad, India, 20 January 2020
Zydus, a leading discovery based global pharmaceutical company today announced that it has entered into a licensing agreement with China Medical System Holdings Limited (CMS) for the development and commercialization of Desidustat, a novel oral HIF-PH inhibitor for the treatment of anemia in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) not-on-dialysis and for the treatment of Anemia CKD patients on dialysis in Greater China (Mainland China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macao Special Administrative Region and Taiwan).
It has been reported that more than 120 million people are estimated to be living with CKD in China1 (Source: Zhang L, Wang F, Wang L et al. Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in China: a cross-sectional survey. Lancet 2012; 379: 815–822). CKD is a serious medical condition which is an unmet healthcare need involving gradual loss of functioning of kidneys eventually leading
to kidney failure. If kidneys are healthy they will naturally secrete beneficial levels of a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO), which encourages red blood cell production that carry oxygen to the muscles and brain. If the kidneys are impaired they will produce reduced levels or tire of EPO production completely, leading to fatigue and anemia.
Anemia is one of the frequent complications of CKD. A survey in China showed that the prevalence of anemia in patients at CKD stage 1 to 5 were 22.0%, 37.0%, 45.4%, 85.1%, and 98.2%, respectively2 . The target-achieving rate was only 8.2% for anemia patients in nondialysis CKD and 35.2% for dialysis CKD, showing unmet healthcare need3
.
Speaking on the development, Pankaj R. Patel, Chairman, Zydus Group said, “The licensing agreement with CMS will facilitate the development and commercialization of Desidustat in Greater China, and make this innovative candidate available to millions of CKD patients living with anemia.”
Under the license agreement, CMS will pay Zydus an initial upfront payment, regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalties on net sales of the product. The commercial terms of the license agreement are confidential. CMS will be responsible for development,
registration and commercialization of Desidustat in Greater China. Zydus had initiated two Phase III trials of Desidustat. The DREAM-ND (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04012957) Phase III trial is being conducted in CKD patients not-on-dialysis. The DREAM-D Phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04215120) is being  conducted in CKD patients on Dialysis. Desidustat had previously met its primary endpoints in the Phase II clinical studies and showed good safety profile. The Phase I trials were earlier completed in Australia.

<strong>Basel, January 20, 2020</strong> — Novartis today announced the European Commission (EC) has approved Mayzent<sup>®</sup> (siponimod) for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity. Although every patient’s MS journey is unique, up to 80% of relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients will eventually transition to SPMS<sup>4</sup>. Mayzent addresses an unmet need for SPMS patients with active disease who, until now, did not have an oral treatment that has been shown to be effective in delaying progression in this patient population. The European marketing authorization makes Mayzent the first and only indicated oral treatment proven in SPMS patients with active disease based on a randomized clinical trial of a broad range of SPMS patients.
“We are delighted by the news that there is now a treatment available for people in Europe living with active SPMS to potentially delay the progression of this debilitating disease,” said Pedro Carrascal, President of the European MS Platform. “This treatment brings hope for improved care and quality of life to patients who have long been underserved.”
The EC’s approval is based on data from the EXPAND study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, comparing the efficacy and safety of Mayzent versus placebo in a broad range of SPMS patients (EDSS score 3·0–6·5 at baseline). EXPAND included a subgroup of patients with active disease (n=779), defined as patients with relapses in the two years prior to the study and/or presence of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at baseline. The baseline characteristics were similar except for signs of activity compared to the overall population.
In the subgroup of Mayzent-treated patients with active disease, results showed:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) was significantly reduced by 31% compared to placebo and by 37% compared to placebo, respectively<sup>5</sup>.</li>
 	<li>Significant favorable outcomes in other relevant measures of MS disease activity, including annualized relapse rate (ARR – confirmed relapses), MRI disease activity and brain volume loss (brain shrinkage)<sup>5</sup>.</li>
</ul>
Results in the overall population showed that Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of three-month CDP (primary endpoint; 21% reduction versus placebo, p=0.013) and meaningfully delayed the risk of six-month CDP (26% versus placebo, p=0.0058)<sup>2</sup>. Mayzent also has a meaningful benefit on cognition and demonstrated clinically relevant effects on cognitive processing speed<sup>5</sup>.
“As the only indicated oral therapy proven for people living with SPMS with active disease, we are pleased that the European approval of Mayzent will help change the conversation about progressing MS and expand possibilities for patients and their caregivers,” said Max Bricchi, Global Head, Neuroscience Franchise, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Delaying progression is hugely important for people living with MS who want to maintain independence longer and today’s decision gives them a chance to achieve this goal. We are dedicated in our mission to reimagine medicine and enable brighter futures for people with severe progressive diseases like MS.”
Novartis is working closely with all stakeholders to ensure that eligible European patients can start benefitting from this treatment as quickly as possible. In March 2019, Novartis received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Mayzent for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), to include clinically isolated syndrome (CIS*), relapsing remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. In November 2019, Novartis received approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for Mayzent for adult patients with SPMS. Novartis is committed to bringing Mayzent to patients worldwide, and additional regulatory filings are currently underway in Switzerland, Japan, Canada and China.
<strong>About </strong><strong>Mayzent</strong><strong><sup>®</sup></strong> <strong>(siponimod)</strong>
Mayzent is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that selectively binds to S1P1 and S1P5 receptors. In relation to the S1P1 receptor, it prevents the lymphocytes from egressing the lymph nodes and as a consequence, from entering the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with MS<sup>2</sup>. This leads to the anti-inflammatory effects of Mayzent<sup>6</sup>. Mayzent also enters the CNS<sup>7,8,9</sup>and binds to the S1P5 sub-receptor on specific cells in the CNS, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and has shown pro-remyelinating and neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of MS<sup>10,11,12</sup>.
In the European Union (EU), Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with SPMS with active disease evidenced by relapsing or imaging features of inflammatory activity. In the US, Mayzent is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to include CIS*, relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. In November 2019, Novartis received approval from the Australian TGA for Mayzent for adult patients with SPMS. The approvals in the US, Australia, and EU are based on the Phase III EXPAND trial, the largest controlled clinical study of a broad range of SPMS patients, showing Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of disease progression, including impact on physical disability and cognitive decline<sup>2</sup>. Novartis is committed to bringing Mayzent to patients worldwide, and additional regulatory filings are currently underway in Switzerland, Japan, Canada and China.
<strong>About</strong><strong> the EXPAND Study</strong><sup>2</sup>
EXPAND is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study, comparing the efficacy and safety of Mayzent versus placebo in people with SPMS with varying levels of disability, EDSS scores of 3·0–6·5. It is the largest randomized, controlled study in SPMS to date, including 1,651 people with a diagnosis of SPMS from 31 countries. Mayzent demonstrated a safety profile that was overall consistent with the known effects of S1P receptor modulation. It reduced the risk of three-month CDP by a statistically significant 21% (p=0.013; primary endpoint). CDP was defined as a 1-point increase in EDSS, if the baseline score was 3·0–5·0, or a 0·5-point increase, if the baseline score was 5·5–6·5. No significant differences were found in the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test. T2 lesion volume was reduced by 79% as compared to placebo. Additional secondary endpoints included a relative reduction in the ARR by 55%, and compared to placebo, more patients were free from Gd-enhancing lesions (89% vs 67% for placebo) and from new or enlarging T2 lesions (57% vs 37% for placebo). Additional exploratory analyses presented at the 35<sup>th</sup>Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), demonstrated Mayzent can help patients keep their mobility for over four years longer on average<sup>13</sup><sup>†</sup>.
<strong>About Multiple Sclerosis</strong>
MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss<sup>14</sup>. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide<sup>4</sup>, is often characterized into three forms: primary progressive MS (PPMS)<sup>15</sup>, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and SPMS, which follows from an initial RRMS course and is characterized by physical and cognitive changes over time, in presence or absence of relapses, leading to a progressive accumulation of neurological disability<sup>16</sup>. Approximately 85% of patients initially present with relapsing forms of MS<sup>4</sup>. There remains a high unmet need for safe and effective treatments to help delay disability progression in SPMS with active disease (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity)<sup>16</sup>.
<strong>About Novartis in MS</strong>
In addition to Mayzent, the Novartis MS portfolio includes also Gilenya<sup>®</sup> (fingolimod, an S1P modulator), which is indicated in the EU for the treatment of adult patients and children and adolescents 10 years of age and older with RRMS. In the United States, Gilenya is approved for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with RMS, to include CIS*, relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease.
Ofatumumab (OMB157), a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets B-cells, is in development for treating RMS. Positive Phase III data presented in September 2019 show ofatumumab met primary endpoints to reduce the ARR in patients with RMS<sup>17</sup>. If approved, ofatumumab will potentially become a treatment for a broad RMS population and the first subcutaneous B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home.
Extavia<sup>®</sup> (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is approved in the US for RMS, to include CIS*, relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. In Europe, Extavia is approved to treat people with RRMS, SPMS with active disease and people who have had a single clinical event suggestive of MS.
In the US, the Sandoz Division of Novartis markets Glatopa<sup>®</sup> (glatiramer acetate injection) 20mg/mL and 40mg/mL, generic versions of Teva's glatiramer acetate.

Basel, 21 January 2020
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Novel combination regimen includes first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate that specifically targets CD79b</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Targeted off-the-shelf treatment provides much-needed new option for people with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Polivy approval is based on a phase Ib/II study, the first and only study showing improved response rates and overall survival in patients with this aggressive lymphoma who are not candidates for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant, compared to a commonly used regimen</strong></li>
</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has granted conditional marketing authorisation for Polivy<sup>®</sup> (polatuzumab vedotin), in combination with bendamustine plus MabThera<sup>®</sup> (rituximab) (BR), for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not candidates for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant.
“With this approval, people in the EU with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will have the opportunity to benefit from this new Polivy combination,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “For patients battling this aggressive disease, the prognosis is poor and few treatments are available. We are proud to bring this first-in-class treatment option to those who need it most.”
The conditional approval is based on the results from the phase Ib/II GO29365 study, the first and only clinical trial to show higher response rates and improved overall survival (OS) compared to BR, a commonly used regimen, in people with R/R DLBCL who are not candidates for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant. Results of the study showed that 40% of people treated with Polivy plus BR achieved a complete response (n=16/40), meaning no cancer could be detected at the time of assessment, compared to 17.5% (n=7/40) with BR alone. Complete response rates were assessed by an independent review committee. The study also showed that OS more than doubled, with a median of 12.4 months in the Polivy arm vs. 4.7 months in the BR alone arm (HR=0.42). Furthermore, patients treated with Polivy plus BR showed a longer time between first response to treatment and disease worsening than those receiving BR alone (investigator assessed median duration of response: 10.3 months vs. 4.1 months; HR=0.44). The most commonly reported adverse events in people treated with Polivy in combination with BR included anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, and pyrexia.
Conditional approval is granted to a medicinal product that fulfils an unmet medical need where the benefit of immediate availability outweighs the risk of less comprehensive data than normally required.
Today’s conditional EU approval follows the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) accelerated approval of Polivy in combination with BR for the treatment of people with R/R DLBCL who have received at least two prior therapies, in June 2019. Polivy was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of people with R/R DLBCL in 2017, the first PRIME designation for a Roche medicine. Additional submissions of the GO29365 data to health authorities around the world are ongoing with the goal of bringing this new treatment option to more patients as soon as possible.
<h3>About the GO29365 study</h3>
GO29365 is a global, phase Ib/II study evaluating the safety, tolerability and activity of Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin) in combination with bendamustine and MabThera (rituximab) (BR) or Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab) in relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Eligible patients were not candidates for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant at study entry. The phase II part of the study randomised 80 patients with heavily pre-treated R/R DLBCL to receive either BR, or BR in combination with Polivy for a fixed duration of six 21-day cycles. Of the patients enrolled, 80% had refractory disease. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) at the end of treatment, as measured by positron emission tomography and assessed by an independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR; CR and partial response) by investigator assessment and best ORR at the end of treatment by investigator and IRC assessment. Exploratory endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, event-free survival and overall survival.
<h3>About Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin)</h3>
Polivy is a first-in-class anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The CD79b protein is expressed specifically in the majority of B-cells (an immune cell impacted in some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)), making it a promising target for the development of new therapies.<sup>1,2</sup> Polivy binds to CD79b and destroys these B-cells through the delivery of an anti-cancer agent, which is thought to minimise the effects on normal cells.<sup>3,4</sup> Polivy is being developed by Roche using Seattle Genetics ADC technology and is currently being investigated for the treatment of NHL. Polivy is marketed in the US by Genentech as Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq), with piiq as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration.
<h3>About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma</h3>
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for about one in three cases of NHL.<sup>5</sup> DLBCL is an aggressive (fast-growing) type of NHL, which is generally responsive to treatment in the frontline.<sup>6</sup> However, as many as 40% of patients will relapse, at which time salvage therapy options are limited and survival is short.<sup>6</sup> Approximately 150,000 people worldwide are estimated to be diagnosed with DLBCL each year.<sup>7</sup>

Highlights:
• New production facility will significantly increase production capacity of RUCONEST®
• Product manufactured at the new facility during the approval process is now available for distribution within the EU
Leiden, The Netherlands, 21 January 2020: Pharming Group N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) today announced it has received European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of a Type II Variation for a new production facility for the Company’s lead product, RUCONEST®. With the addition of this new facility, Pharming will significantly increase the production capacity of RUCONEST® as it becomes fully operational over the coming year. Pharming is now also able to release the product that was manufactured at the facility during the approval process for commercialisation in the EU. As previously announced, Pharming had identified a potential risk of short-term pressure on the supply of RUCONEST® for the European market due to increasing demand for the product. With the approval of this new facility, the Company believes the risk to supply is now greatly reduced. The new facility’s post-approval supplement (PAS) for the distribution of RUCONEST® in the US is still under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Approval of the new facility for distribution in the US is expected in H1 2020.
Sijmen de Vries, Chief Executive of Pharming, said:
“As we continue to see increasing demand for RUCONEST® in the treatment of hereditary angioedema,  we are pleased to announce the approval of our new facility, which will enable us to significantly increase production capacity for supply to patients in the EU. In addition, as a result of our recent re-acquisition of RUCONEST®’s European distribution rights from Sobi, this capacity expansion will allow us to reach an even greater number of EU patients.”
About Pharming Group N.V.
Pharming is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing innovative products for the safe, effective treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs. Pharming’s lead product, RUCONEST® (conestat alfa) is a recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor approved for the treatment of acute Hereditary
Angioedema (“HAE”) attacks in patients in Europe, the US, Israel and South Korea. The product is available on a named-patient basis in other territories where it has not yet obtained marketing authorisation. RUCONEST® is commercialised by Pharming in the USA and in Europe, and the Company holds all other commercialisation rights in other countries not specified below. In some of these other countries distribution is made in association with the HAEi Global Access Program (GAP). RUCONEST® is distributed in Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Venezuela by Cytobioteck, in South Korea by HyupJin Corporation and in Israel by Kamada.
2
RUCONEST® is also being evaluated for various additional indications. Pharming’s technology platform includes a unique, GMP-compliant, validated process for the production of pure recombinant human proteins that has proven capable of producing industrial quantities of high quality recombinant human proteins in a more economical and less immunogenetic way compared with current cell-line based
methods. In addition to RUCONEST® and variants of recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor, Pharming has recently in-licensed leniolisib from Novartis, a small molecule which is in a registrational study for APDS, a form of Primary Immunodeficiency. Leads for enzyme replacement therapy (“ERT”) for Pompe and Fabry’s diseases are also being produced and optimised respectively at present, with additional programs not involving ERT also being explored at an early stage.
Pharming has a long term partnership with the China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry (“CSIPI”), a Sinopharm company, for joint global development of new products, starting with recombinant human Factor VIII for the treatment of Haemophilia A. Preclinical development and manufacturing will take place to global standards at CSIPI and its affiliates and are funded by CSIPI. Clinical development will be shared between the partners with each partner taking the costs for theirterritories under the partnership.

""We are excited that with this approval we can offer <i>Sunosi</i>, a daytime medicine that can provide sustained wakefulness throughout the day, to patients living with excessive daytime sleepiness as a result of OSA or narcolepsy in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>, where historically, treatment options have been very limited,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Bruce Cozadd</span>, chairman and chief executive officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals.
Once-daily <i>Sunosi </i>is approved with doses of 75 mg and 150 mg for people with narcolepsy and doses of 37.5 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg for patients with OSA.<sup>1</sup> At Week 12 of the Phase 3 clinical trial, 150 mg of solriamfetol for narcolepsy patients and both 75 mg and 150 mg doses for OSA patients demonstrated improvements in wakefulness compared to placebo as assessed via the maintenance of wakefulness test from approximately one hour post-dose through approximately nine hours post-dose.
""Most people feel tired sometimes, but those with excessive daytime sleepiness may experience an irresistible need to sleep during the day and an increased likelihood of falling asleep at unexpected times, which can interfere with work, school and other activities,"" said Professor Jean-Louis Pépin, M.D., Ph.D., director of INSERM unit 1042 and head of the sleep and physiology department at the University Hospital in Grenoble, <span class=""xn-location"">France</span>. ""In the EU, approximately 16 million people* may be affected by OSA to some extent, and some of them continue to experience excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate treatment with CPAP for upper airway obstruction. Solriamfetol has the potential to be an important treatment option for patients living with excessive daytime sleepiness as a result of OSA or narcolepsy.""
The European Commission approval extends to all European Union Member States, as well as <span class=""xn-location"">Iceland</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Norway</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Liechtenstein</span>.
""Today's approval is an important milestone both for patients and for Jazz as we expand our neuroscience business to <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> to address unmet needs for people living with chronic, and often debilitating, sleep disorders,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Daniel Swisher</span>, president and chief operating officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. ""Jazz is committed to making <i>Sunosi</i> available to patients in the EU and will now pursue rolling launches across the European Union on a country-by-country basis as pricing and reimbursement and scheduling decisions are made.""
The Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for <i>Sunosi</i> is based on data from four randomised placebo-controlled studies included in the <u>T</u>reatment of <u>O</u>bstructive sleep apnea and <u>N</u>arcolepsy <u>E</u>xcessive <u>S</u>leepiness (TONES) clinical trial program. Data from the studies in the TONES program demonstrated the superiority of solriamfetol relative to placebo.<sup>2-5</sup> The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache (11.1%), nausea (6.6%) and decreased appetite (6.8%). The most serious and frequently occurring adverse reactions were increased blood pressure and palpitations. The majority of most frequently reported adverse events occurred within the first two weeks of treatment and resolved for most patients within 2 weeks. Solriamfetol was evaluated in more than 900 adults with EDS associated with narcolepsy or OSA and was shown to maintain its effect relative to placebo after six months of use.
In the TONES 2 and TONES 3 12-week clinical studies in narcolepsy and OSA patients, respectively, approximately 68-74% of people taking solriamfetol at the 75 mg dose and 78-90% of people taking solriamfetol at the 150 mg dose reported improvement in their overall clinical condition, as assessed by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) scale.
Solriamfetol is not a therapy for the underlying airway obstruction in patients with OSA. Primary OSA therapy should be maintained in these patients and treatment should be initiated by a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of narcolepsy or OSA.
For a full list of side effects and information on dosage and administration, contraindications and other precautions when using solriamfetol, please refer to the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2694644-1&amp;h=2651110505&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fpp.jazzpharma.com%2Fpi%2Fsunosi.en.SmPC.pdf&amp;a=Summary+of+Product+Characteristics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Summary of Product Characteristics</a> for further information.

<b>About Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness <br class=""dnr"" /></b>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), commonly referred to as sleep apnea, is a highly prevalent disease affecting approximately 16 million people in the EU* to some extent.<sup>10</sup> Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), a major symptom of OSA, is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in unplanned lapses into sleep or drowsiness.<sup>11,12</sup> Positive airway pressure therapy, with its most common form being continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), has been shown to be an effective therapy for sleep apnea that frequently results in improvement in EDS in many patients;<sup>13,14</sup> however, not all patients tolerate CPAP therapy and among those who tolerate CPAP, usage is highly variable.<sup>15,16,17</sup> EDS may persist in people with OSA despite using CPAP.<sup>18,19</sup>
<b>About Narcolepsy<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.<sup>20</sup> Narcolepsy is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of 0.02% in European populations.<sup>21</sup> Studies have shown it may take 10 years or more for people with narcolepsy to receive a diagnosis, and it is estimated that more than 50% of patients with narcolepsy have not been diagnosed.<sup>22,23,24</sup> There are five primary symptoms of narcolepsy, including EDS, cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, sleep paralysis and sleep disruption.<sup>11</sup> While all patients with narcolepsy experience EDS, they may not experience all five symptoms.<sup>11</sup>

Inotrem S.A., a biotechnology company specialized in the development of immunotherapies targeting the TREM-1 pathway with potential applications for acute and chronic inflammatory syndromes, announced today that it has entered a worldwide licensing agreement with Roche Diagnostics for the commercialization of a mechanism-based companion diagnostic test using a soluble plasma protein (sTREM-1).
This agreement consolidates existing ties between Roche Diagnostics and Inotrem who are jointly developing since 2017 an in vitro assay for measurement of sTREM-1 in plasma samples of septic shock patients. Measurement of sTREM-1 in blood provides a valuable indicator for the severity and outcome prediction of septic shock patients. One of the main issues with septic shock is the heterogeneity of the patient population. The companion diagnostic test will allow a stratification of patients to identify those who are more likely to respond to Inotrem’s treatment. Septic shock is the ultimate complication of sepsis. The incidence of septic shock continuously raises, and mortality remains elevated (35%) in developed countries. There is currently no specific mechanism-based therapy approved for this indication besides antibiotics and symptomatic treatment. Inotrem’s therapeutic solution has the potential to become the first targeted treatment for septic shock. “We are delighted to extend our partnership with Inotrem to make the sTREM-1 test, which we are co-developing at Roche, available for patients globally. Through the development and commercialization of this novel companion diagnostic test we are committed to delivering a solution that enables much needed, better decisions for sepsis patients”, said Ann Costello, Global Head Centralised and Point of Care Solutions, Roche Diagnostics.
“Roche Diagnostics’ licensing agreement is an important milestone for us: it is a strong endorsement of Inotrem’s innovative approach targeting the TREM-1 pathway, and it allows us to further focus on our core mission: the development of a nangibotide-based septic shock treatment” added Dr. Jean-Jacques Garaud, CEO of Inotrem. Inotrem has recently initiated its Phase IIb study in septic shock patients (ASTONISH trial) and enrolled its first patient. The study aims at demonstrating efficacy of its lead compound, nangibotide, and bring a clinically relevant proof of clinical activity in septic shock patients. Thi  study also intends to confirm the value of soluble TREM-1 as a potential companion diagnostic test to identify patients more likely to benefit from nangibotide treatment.

 	<li>PhoreMost’s next-generation phenotypic screening platform, SITESEEKER, to identify novel targets for Otsuka’s therapeutics discovery programmes</li>
 	<li>Programmes to initially focus on gene therapy applications of identified targets</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cambridge, UK, 21 January 2020:</strong> PhoreMost Limited, the UK-based biopharmaceutical company dedicated to drugging ‘undruggable’ disease targets, today announced it has entered into a multi-project collaboration with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., the world-leading pharmaceutical company dedicated to the research and development of highly-innovative drugs and diagnostics. Financial details of the agreement are not disclosed.
PhoreMost will deploy its in-house expertise and next-generation phenotypic screening platform, SITESEEKER®, towards disease relevant pathways nominated by Otsuka. Novel targets identified will be further validated and characterised by Otsuka as part of its internal development pipeline, with an initial focus on gene therapy applications of identified targets.
PhoreMost’s SITESEEKER platform exploits protein shape diversity to find functionally active peptides, significantly enhancing the power of phenotypic screening and translation into therapeutic modalities. Based on proprietary protein interference, or ‘PROTEINi®’, technology PhoreMost uses SITESEEKER to probe the entire proteome in a live cell environment for novel druggable targets linked to any chosen disease. This enables the systematic discovery of functionally active peptides which are directly linked to useful therapeutic applications.
<blockquote>This collaboration with Otsuka is further recognition of the power of the SITESEEKER approach to drive the identification of novel, druggable targets. We are particularly excited to be exploring not only small molecule therapeutics but also gene therapy applications of our platform.

January 20, 2020 01:43 PM Eastern Standard Time
BEERSE, Belgium–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorisation for Darzalex® (daratumumab) in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). This approval is based on results from Part one of the Phase 3 CASSIOPEIA (MMY3006) study, published in The Lancet5 in June 2019 and presented at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Meeting.
“This approval represents our commitment to investigate daratumumab in earlier disease stages of multiple myeloma and to develop more effective frontline treatment options for newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for transplantation”

“The effectiveness of first-line treatment is critical to maximise time until relapse. So, we asked ourselves, can we improve the standard of care that is bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) to provide patients with valuable extra time?” said Philippe Moreau, M.D., principal investigator and Head of the Haematology Department at the University Hospital of Nantes, France. “The CASSIOPEIA study answered that question definitively, demonstrating that the addition of daratumumab in combination with VTd can lead to very deep remissions and also prolong PFS. I’m pleased to see the European Commission have recognised this as well.”
“Today’s approval marks the first opportunity for newly diagnosed, transplant eligible patients to be treated with a monoclonal antibody, and the first new treatment for this patient population in over six years,” said Dr Patrick Laroche, Haematology Therapy Area Lead, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag. “We are thrilled that newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma and their doctors will have a long-awaited additional frontline therapy.”
The Phase 3 CASSIOPEIA trial is a two-part study. Results from this first part of the trial showed that after consolidation, the stringent complete response (sCR) rate was significantly higher in the daratumumab-VTd arm (29 percent) compared to VTd alone (20 percent) (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.60; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.21-2.12; P<0.0010).2 At a median follow-up of 18.8 months, PFS was significantly improved in the daratumumab-VTd group compared to VTd alone (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.47; 95 percent CI, 0.33-0.67; P<0.0001), and the median PFS was not reached in either arm.2 The addition of daratumumab to VTd resulted in an 18-month PFS rate of 93 percent compared to 85 percent for VTd alone.2
The most common (=10%) Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for daratumumab-VTd and VTd, respectively, were neutropenia (28 percent vs. 15 percent), lymphopenia (17 percent vs. 10 percent), stomatitis (13 percent vs. 16 percent) and thrombocytopenia (11 percent vs. 7 percent).2 In the daratumumab-VTd combination arm, infusion-related reactions occurred in 35 percent of patients.2
“This approval represents our commitment to investigate daratumumab in earlier disease stages of multiple myeloma and to develop more effective frontline treatment options for newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for transplantation,” adds Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC.

In Europe, daratumumab is indicated:4

in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy
as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy
About the CASSIOPEIA Trial6
The randomised, open-label, multicentre, Phase 3 study is sponsored by the French Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome in collaboration with the Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology and Janssen Research & Development, LLC. The study included 1,085 newly diagnosed patients with previously untreated, symptomatic multiple myeloma who were eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. In the first part of the study, patients were randomised to receive induction treatment with VTd alone or in combination with daratumumab, high-dose therapy and ASCT, and consolidation therapy with VTd alone or in combination with daratumumab. The primary endpoint in this part of the study is the proportion of patients who achieve an sCR 100 days after transplant. In the second part of the study, which is ongoing, patients who achieved a partial response or better in part one will undergo a second randomisation to receive maintenance treatment with daratumumab 16 mg/kg every eight weeks for up to two years or will be observed with no further treatment. The primary endpoint in this part of the study is progression-free survival (PFS).
About daratumumab
Daratumumab is a first-in-class7 biologic targeting CD38, a surface protein that is highly expressed across multiple myeloma cells, regardless of disease stage.8 Daratumumab is believed to induce tumour cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), as well as through apoptosis, in which a series of molecular steps in a cell lead to its death.4 A subset of myeloid derived suppressor cells (CD38+ MDSCs), CD38+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD38+ B cells (Bregs) were decreased by daratumumab.4 Since launch, it is estimated that 100,000 patients have been treated with daratumumab worldwide.3Daratumumab is being evaluated in a comprehensive clinical development programme across a range of treatment settings in multiple myeloma, such as in frontline and relapsed settings.6,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess its potential in other malignant and pre-malignant haematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, such as smouldering myeloma.16,17 For more information, please see https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/.
For further information on daratumumab, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/darzalex.
In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive licence to develop, manufacture and commercialise daratumumab.18
About Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.19 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.20 Almost 60 percent of patients with MM do not survive more than five years after diagnosis.21
Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.22 Refractory MM is when a patient’s disease progresses within 60 days of their last therapy.23,24 Relapsed cancer is when the disease has returned after a period of initial, partial or complete remission.25 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.26 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and few treatment options available.27

A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of OBI-999 has commenced enrollment at the <span class=""xn-org"">University of Texas</span> M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, with Dr. Apostolia M Tsimberidou as the Principal Investigator, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including Gastric, Pancreatic, Colorectal and Esophageal Cancers (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04084366). The objective of the trial is to verify the safety and preliminary efficacy profile of OBI-999 in these patient populations.
<span class=""xn-person"">Tillman Pearce</span>, MD, CMO, OBI Pharma noted, “Advanced gastric cancer is an orphan disease where targeted therapies are lacking for the majority of patients. OBI-999 is an antibody-drug conjugate therapeutic targeting the cancer-associated glycolipid antigen, Globo H. OBI-999 incorporates a validated payload, MMAE, with a proprietary linker technology. It has demonstrated high effectiveness in xenograft models of metastatic gastric cancer that overexpress Globo H. Clinical development of this agent will be guided by evaluation of patients based on a validated Globo H immunohistochemistry assay, which will allow selection of patients whose tumors overexpress this tumor antigen for clinical investigation.”
<b>About Gastric Cancer</b>
Gastric cancer (GC), or stomach cancer, is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the lining of the stomach. The majority of GC (90-95%) presents as adenocarcinomas arising from the mucosa layer. Some of the potential risk factors associated with GC include <i>Helicobacter pylori </i>infection, high intake of salt, low consumption of fruits and vegetables, obesity, heavy alcohol consumption, chronic atrophic gastritis and cigarette smoking.
GC is a deadly disease and an estimated prevalence in 2019 at 100,189 individuals in the US, with a low 5-year survivability of 31.0%. Current standard treatment options for patients with advanced or recurrent GC are associated with limited efficacy and unfavorable toxicity profile, especially for extended use or maintenance treatment in a patient population which is often already frail and cachectic.
<b>About Orphan Drug Designation (ODD)</b>
The orphan drug designation provides OBI Pharma with potential benefits, including market exclusivity upon regulatory approval is received, exemption of FDA application fees, and tax credits for qualified clinical trials. The FDA’s Office of Orphan Drug Products grants orphan status to support development of medicines for rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.
<b>About OBI-999</b>
OBI-999 is a novel first-in-class Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) with a proprietary linker technology that provides a consistent Drug-to-Antibody ratio (DAR) for cancer treatment that is based on Globo H, an antigen expressed in up to 15 epithelial cancers. OBI-999 uses a Globo H antibody to target cancer cells of high Globo H expression. By releasing a small molecule chemotherapeutic drug through the specificity of the antibody, it directly deploys cytotoxic therapy at the targeted cancer cells. OBI-999 is currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04084366) to test its safety and efficacy as an oncology ADC therapy. In pre-clinical xenograft animal models in multiple tumor types (gastric, pancreatic, lung and breast), OBI-999 has demonstrated profound tumor shrinkage at various doses. In pre-clinical single and repeated dose toxicology studies, OBI-999 was well-tolerated, and achieved a favorable safety margin which warrants further clinical development. OBI Pharma owns global rights to OBI-999.
<b>About OBI Pharma</b>

DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 21, 2020-- Horizon Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: HZNP) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TEPEZZA<sup>TM</sup> (teprotumumab-trbw) for the treatment of Thyroid Eye Disease (TED). TEPEZZA is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of TED, a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune disease that is associated with proptosis (eye bulging), diplopia (double vision), blurred vision, pain, inflammation and facial disfigurement. TEPEZZA is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a targeted inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) that is administered to patients once every three weeks for a total of eight infusions.
“Today is a great day for people living with Thyroid Eye Disease, a rare, vision-threatening disease that previously had no FDA-approved treatment options,” said Timothy Walbert, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Horizon. “The TED community has gone far too long without an FDA-approved therapy, and we are grateful to the people living with TED and physicians who partnered with us on the clinical development program that led to today’s approval of TEPEZZA. This also marks the early approval of Horizon’s first Biologics License Application – a key step in our evolution to an innovation-focused biopharma company, developing new medicines for debilitating diseases with few or no treatment options.”
The FDA approval of TEPEZZA comes ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 8, 2020. The medicine received Priority Review, Orphan Drug, Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations from the FDA.
“The FDA approval of TEPEZZA is momentous for the TED community and has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for TED – providing new hope for people who are living with this horrible, vision-threatening disease,” said Raymond Douglas, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Orbital and Thyroid Eye Disease Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and co-principal investigator of the TEPEZZA Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial. “Today’s news brings forward a medicine for patients that targets the underlying biology of the disease and has been shown to significantly improve eye bulging and double vision, which are the most debilitating aspects of the disease.”
“TEPEZZA is a much-needed breakthrough for a community of people who have historically had to struggle in pain as their symptoms progress – risking permanent damage to their eyes and making it extremely difficult to go about their daily lives,” said Jeff Todd, president and chief executive officer, <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.PreventBlindness.org&amp;esheet=52161835&amp;newsitemid=20200121006017&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Prevent+Blindness&amp;index=1&amp;md5=2e1524f62e82ac5dd37046ddd7dafe20"" rel=""nofollow"">Prevent Blindness</a>. “This approval is meaningful to our organization because we are committed to helping patients with vision impairment and those who are at significant risk.”
The FDA approval of TEPEZZA is supported by a robust body of clinical evidence, including statistically significant, positive results from the <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa1614949&amp;esheet=52161835&amp;newsitemid=20200121006017&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Phase+2+clinical+study&amp;index=2&amp;md5=2c9761ed65dd0a41d6bd99b92842a79b"" rel=""nofollow"">Phase 2 clinical study</a>, as well as the Phase 3 confirmatory clinical study <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.horizontherapeutics.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fnew-data-phase-3-teprotumumab-trial-optic-shows-dramatic&amp;esheet=52161835&amp;newsitemid=20200121006017&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=OPTIC&amp;index=3&amp;md5=c1bbb6c29c95ac84b60523a007207638"" rel=""nofollow"">OPTIC</a> (Treatment of Graves’ <strong>O</strong>rbitopathy [Thyroid Eye Disease] to Reduce <strong>P</strong>roptosis with <strong>T</strong>eprotumumab <strong>I</strong>nfusions in a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, <strong>C</strong>linical Study). The OPTIC study found that significantly more patients treated with TEPEZZA (82.9%) had a meaningful improvement in proptosis (= 2 mm) as compared with placebo patients (9.5%) (p?0.001) without deterioration in the fellow eye at Week 24. Additional secondary endpoints were also met, including a change from baseline of at least one grade in diplopia (double vision) in 67.9% of patients receiving TEPEZZA compared to 28.6% of patients receiving placebo (p=0.001) at Week 24. In a related analysis of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies, there were more patients with complete resolution of diplopia among those treated with TEPEZZA (53%) compared with those treated with placebo (25%). The majority of adverse events experienced with TEPEZZA treatment were graded as mild to moderate and were manageable in the trials, with few discontinuations or therapy interruptions.
Horizon will conduct a post-marketing study to evaluate safety in a larger patient population as was discussed at the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee (DODAC) FDA Advisory Committee meeting on December 13, 2019, where the committee voted unanimously (12-0) that TEPEZZA demonstrated a positive benefit risk profile. This study will also evaluate retreatment rates relative to how long patients receive the medicine.
TEPEZZA is expected to be available in the United States in the coming weeks. To speak with a Nurse Advocateabout TED, patients can call 1-833-483-7399.

<strong>About Thyroid Eye Disease</strong>
Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) is a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune disease.<sup>1 </sup>While TED often occurs in people living with hyperthyroidism or Graves’ disease, it is a distinct disease that is caused by autoantibodies activating an IGF-1R-mediated signaling complex on cells within the retro-orbital space.<sup>2,3 </sup>This leads to a cascade of negative effects, which may cause long-term, irreversible damage. As TED progresses, it causes serious damage – including proptosis (eye bulging), strabismus (misalignment of the eyes) and diplopia (double vision) – and in some cases can lead to blindness.<sup>4,5</sup> Historically, patients have had to live with TED until the inflammation subsides, after which they are often left with permanent and vision-impairing consequences.<sup>1,6</sup>
<strong>About TEPEZZA</strong>
<strong>INDICATION</strong>
TEPEZZA is indicated for the treatment of Thyroid Eye Disease.
<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>
<strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong>
<strong>Infusion Reactions:</strong> TEPEZZA may cause infusion reactions. Infusion reactions have been reported in approximately 4% of patients treated with TEPEZZA. Reported infusion reactions have usually been mild or moderate in severity. Signs and symptoms may include transient increases in blood pressure, feeling hot, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache and muscular pain. Infusion reactions may occur during an infusion or within 1.5 hours after an infusion. In patients who experience an infusion reaction, consideration should be given to premedicating with an antihistamine, antipyretic, or corticosteroid and/or administering all subsequent infusions at a slower infusion rate.
<strong>Preexisting inflammatory bowel disease:</strong> TEPEZZA may cause an exacerbation of preexisting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Monitor patients with IBD for flare of disease. If IBD exacerbation is suspected, consider discontinuation of TEPEZZA.
<strong>Hyperglycemia:</strong> Increased blood glucose or hyperglycemia may occur in patients treated with TEPEZZA. In clinical trials, 10% of patients (two-thirds of whom had preexisting diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance) experienced hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemic events should be managed with medications for glycemic control, if necessary. Monitor patients for elevated blood glucose and symptoms of hyperglycemia while on treatment with TEPEZZA. Patients with preexisting diabetes should be under appropriate glycemic control before receiving TEPEZZA.
<strong>Adverse Reactions</strong>
The most common adverse reactions (incidence =5% and greater than placebo) are muscle spasm, nausea, alopecia, diarrhea, fatigue, hyperglycemia, hearing impairment, dysgeusia, headache and dry skin.

<p align=""center""><em>With FDA Approval, More Patients in the U.S. Are Now Candidates for a Leadless Pacing Option</em></p>
<p align=""start""><strong>DUBLIN, Jan. 21, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- </strong> Medtronic plc (NYSE:<a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=MDT&amp;exchange=4"">MDT</a>) today announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Micra™ AV, the world’s smallest pacemaker with atrioventricular (AV) synchrony. Micra AV is indicated for the treatment of patients with<strong> </strong>AV block, a condition in which the electrical signals between the chambers of the heart (the atria and the ventricle) are impaired. Medtronic now offers the first and only FDA-approved leadless pacemaker portfolio, expanding the number of potential candidates for this groundbreaking technology in the U.S.</p>
<p align=""start"">“With the approval of Micra AV, more pacemaker patients qualify for a new treatment option that offers the advantages of leadless pacing – including a minimally invasive implant procedure and a cosmetically invisible device,” said Larry Chinitz, M.D., cardiac electrophysiologist and director of NYU Langone’s Heart Rhythm Center in New York City. “Although complications with traditional pacemakers are infrequent, when they occur, they’re expensive to treat and can be invasive for the patient. Real-world use of Micra has shown a 63% reduction in major complications compared to traditional pacemakers.”</p>
<p align=""start"">Historically, patients with AV block have been treated with traditional dual-chamber pacemakers which are implanted in the upper chest, under the skin below the collar bone, and connected to the heart using thin wires called “leads.” Identical in size and shape to the original Micra Transcatheter Pacing System (TPS), Micra AV has several additional internal atrial sensing algorithms which detect cardiac movement, allowing the device to adjust pacing in the ventricle to coordinate with the atrium, providing “AV synchronous” pacing therapy to patients with AV block.</p>
<p align=""start"">The Micra AV approval is based on data from the MARVEL 2 (Micra Atrial Tracking Using A Ventricular accELerometer) study, which evaluated the safety and effectiveness of accelerometer-based atrial sensing algorithms. The study evaluated the ability of the Micra’s internal sensor to monitor and detect atrial contractions and enable coordinated pacing between the atrium and ventricle, thereby providing AV synchrony.<strong> </strong>Results from the study, presented at the American Heart Association 2019 Scientific Sessions and published simultaneously in <a title="""" href=""http://electrophysiology.onlinejacc.org/content/early/2019/11/04/j.jacep.2019.10.017"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><em><u>JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology</u></em></a>, showed the primary efficacy objective was met, with a significantly greater percentage of complete heart block patients with normal sinus rhythm having <u>&gt;</u>70% AV synchrony during algorithm-mediated AV synchronous pacing (38 of 40 patients, 95%) than VVI pacing (0 patients, P&lt;0.001 for proportion of patients with <u>&gt;</u>70% synchrony). The study’s primary safety objective was also met, with no pauses or episodes of pacing-induced tachycardia reported during algorithm mediated AV synchronous pacing.</p>
<p align=""start"">Medtronic will begin training field personnel and physicians, and will activate a limited number of implanting centers in the coming weeks, with full launch anticipated later this spring.</p>
<p align=""start"">“Since revolutionizing medicine with the first battery-powered cardiac pacemakers, Medtronic has continued to develop pioneering pacing technologies, culminating in the first miniaturized, leadless pacing portfolio for physicians and their patients,” said Rob Kowal, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer, vice president of medical affairs in the Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. “The introduction of Micra AV reinvents our own innovation, bringing the many benefits of leadless pacemakers to more patients.”</p>
<p align=""start""><strong><u>About the Micra Transcatheter Pacing System (TPS)</u></strong>
Approved by the FDA in 2016, the Micra TPS is a leadless pacemaker option for patients who only require pacing in the right ventricle. Comparable in size to a large vitamin, Micra is less than one-tenth the size of traditional pacemakers yet delivers advanced pacing technology to patients via a minimally invasive approach. During the implant procedure, the device is attached to the heart with small tines and delivers electrical impulses that pace the heart through an electrode at the end of the device.</p>
<p align=""start"">Unlike traditional pacemakers, Micra does not require leads or a surgical ""pocket"" under the skin, so potential sources of complications related to leads and pockets are eliminated - as are any visible signs of the device.</p>
<p align=""start"">In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers and scientists worldwide, Medtronic offers the broadest range of innovative medical technology for the interventional and surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. Medtronic strives to offer products and services of the highest quality that deliver clinical and economic value to healthcare consumers and providers around the world.</p>

<strong>Issued: London, UK</strong>
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a priority review for the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA) seeking approval of belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma whose prior therapy included an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody.
The BLA is based on data from the pivotal DREAMM-2 (DRiving Excellence in Approaches to Multiple Myeloma) study, recently published in <em>The Lancet Oncology</em>, which enrolled heavily pre-treated patients who had actively progressing multiple myeloma that had worsened despite current standard of care.<sup>[1]</sup>
In 2017, belantamab mafodotin was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, which is intended to facilitate the development of investigational medicines that have shown clinical promise for conditions where there is significant unmet need.
<h2><strong>About B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)</strong></h2>
The normal function of BCMA is to promote plasma cell survival by transduction of signals from two known ligands, BAFF (B-cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand). This pathway has been shown to be important for myeloma cell growth and survival. BCMA expression is limited to B cells at later stages of development. BCMA is expressed at varying levels in myeloma patients and BCMA membrane expression is universally detected in myeloma cell lines.<sup>[2]</sup>
<h2><strong>About multiple myeloma</strong></h2>
Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer and is generally considered treatable, but not curable.<sup>[3]</sup> In the US, more than 32,000 people were diagnosed with multiple myeloma last year and nearly 13,000 people died from the disease.<sup>[4]</sup> Research into new therapies is needed as multiple myeloma commonly becomes refractory to available treatments.<sup>[5]</sup>
<h2><strong>About the DREAMM clinical trial programme for belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916)</strong></h2>
Belantamab mafodotin is an investigational immunoconjugate comprising a humanised anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F via non-cleavable linker. The drug linker technology is licensed from Seattle Genetics; monoclonal antibody is produced using POTELLIGENT Technology licensed from BioWa.
Belantamab mafodotin is not currently approved for use anywhere in the world.
